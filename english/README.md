For human essays, we adopted the Uppsala Student English Corpus (https://ota.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/repository/xmlui/handle/20.500.12024/2457).

The corpus originally consists of 1,489 essays written by 440 Swedish university students of English at three different proficiency levels, the majority in their first term of full-time studies.

We restrict our analysis to the essays found in the 'a2' folder for two main reasons: the amount of data and the nature of the task.

Learners were asked to write argumentative essays, as opposed to composing a text based on personal experiences, whose machine-generated counterparts are more difficult to generate.

Topics are varied and explicitly provided for each essay. We used a total of 335 essays.

We complement the datasets with the same number of machine-generated texts.

For this purpose, we prompt ChatGPT with the following caption: "Write an 800-word essay on [topic]."

Topics are matched for each human writing in our dataset.
