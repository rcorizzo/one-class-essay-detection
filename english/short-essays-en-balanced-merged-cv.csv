0,0100.a2.txt,We shouldn't exploit animals.,"Today most of us accept science. Science of today, especially Darwins Evolutionary Theory teaches us that the human race has developed from animals and that humanbeings basically are animals among other animals. Eventhough we do agree with this aspect of science we tend to consider man as the crown of creation with a natural right to treat animals as we please and use them for our own purposes as food, tools and experimentinstruments. I belive this is wrong and in this essay I will explain why we morally have no right to exploit animals. I am also going to show how meaningless many of the experiments made on animals are.

To begin with I would like to say that the line we draw today in order to distinguish ourselves from animals is strictly arbitrary. There isn't any quality that includes all humanity that empower us a narural position as superiour to animals. Most humanbeings have unique capacities though, such as language and higher mental abilities but it's important to emphasize that these abilities don't include all humanity, for example they don't include seniles, mentally handicaped or newborns. In fact there are some fullgrown vertebrates that have higher mental abilities than seniles.
The concept ""animals"" is very wide and include a variety of different creatures from chimpanzees to oysters. We are often very conscious about making a distinction between humans and chimpanzees but scientifically it's proved that humans are more psycologically related to chimpanzees than chimpanzees are to oysters. Personally I think it would be more logical to draw the line between creatures that have consciousness and those who haven't. The animals with consciousness have feelings and goals for their existence, they can feel pain and know if a thing goes good or bad. All these animals should have the same right as humans to exist for their own sake as individuals and not being valued just for how useful they are to humans. For example, just as we wouldn't do experiments on or eat mentally retarded we shouldnt do it to animals since intelectual abilities seem to be the things we base the world hierarcy upon.

There are laws that prevent ordinary people from beating their dogs to death, but a scientist can do the exact same thing without being punished. The difference is that the scientist is supposed to promote science. It's hard to understand how people can spent their workinghours putting monkeys in lifelong depressions, heating up dogs until they die or make cats drug addicts. It's even harder to understand that the taxpayers allow this to happen. 
I think that one explanation is that people in general have a huge faith in science and that they have no idea what's going on in the labratories. A lot of people think that cruel experiments are justified because they are necessary in order to come up with new medicines and cures to save human lives. This attitude has very little to do with reality. The truth is that most of the time these experiments are trivial and meaningless. There are of course some experiments that have led to new knowledge in medicine but in proportion they are very few. Most of the painful experiments are not made in order to save lives, they are made in order to make new products for the luxery industry, the industry or the cemical weapon industry. These are things that we don't really need for our survival.
There is always a risk translating one species_ reaction to another. One example of what can happen is the case of Neurosedyn. Scientists tested Neurosedyn on a lot of animals before it was released on the market. On the animals it didn't cause any deformity on the foetus but on humans it did.
I think that in the high technology era of today there must be rather easy to come up with some alternatives to experimenting on animals.

In this essay I have emphasized that human beings have no natural right to exploit animals the way we do today. The way we act towards animals, especially the ones with consciousness, is very discriminating since we can't distinguish ourselves from them in a clear way. I also think that we have to stop the cruel experiments on animals that are performed today and find other alternatives because they are painful and cause alot of unnessecary suffering, they might also be dangerous to humans.",0
1,0101.a2.txt,Speed limits- life saver or nuisance?,"How can we avoid traffic accidents? Unfortunately, we can not, but we can reduce the number of people getting injured and even killed without too much of an effort. It would not take much from the driver; a couple of kilometres per hour slower and a tragedy is prevented.
In my opinion, speed limits are most definitely a life saver and I will in this essay argue for them to be more carefully looked after.

There has been some debate on this topic lately and politicians, for example, have argued that speed limits should be lower in winter time. Our neighbour in the east, Finland, already practises this principle. Speed limits on certain roads are lowered and the result is that fewer people get killed or injured. This is something that we here in Sweden must take after. Every year in the winter the amount of traffic accidents increase due to bad weather. The roads may seem dry and safe when they are in fact covered with a thin layer of ice. The weather factor and the false feeling of security, almost of immortality, in our new cars are two of the dangers when driving. Of course, speed limits can not be reduced everywhere just because of the fact that it is winter or that we feel safe in our cars. But, for example, on roads that are known for being dangerous the speed limit could be changed from 110 kilometres per hour to 90, or from 90 km/h to 70. This procedure would certainly save many lives.

Another good reason for lowering the speed limits is for the sake of the environment. Cars impose a great threat to nature with their fumes and until more environment-friendly cars are built a slower speed will reduce the damages on nature. This fact might sound a bit strange, but it is true that the faster cars go, the more exhaust fumes are spread.

My third argument on this topic is that people who drive too fast should be more often punished. Every time I go by car on the motorway to Stockholm, I notice that nearly half of all drivers are speeding; some of them go as fast as 140 km/h. That is not acceptable! It is irresponsible because on a motorway, you are not alone and an accident in 140 km/h is a disaster. As I mentioned earlier on, there has been quite some debate about speed limits lately and one terrifying fact that came up was that if the driver is driving two km/h too fast, the risk of getting killed increases with 20 per cent. Thus, the margins are very small. 

So what can we do? We can obviously drive slower, but what if we do not? Should punishments (fines, jail) be tougher? One could hardly argue for that speeding offences should lead to prison, that is taking it a bit too far. Fines however are in my opinion a very good punishment. People love money and may think twice before speeding again after a fine of a couple of thousand crowns. The problem today with fines is that not very many people are stopped by the police and forced to pay. There is simply no money to provide for enough policemen to keep after the drivers. The question is whether the government should put more money into the police force or not. More money would not just make the roads safer but also, obviously, reduce all crimes. That is however a totally different story. One solution to the speeding problem could be to have camera supervision to register cars that go too fast. This way, the need for policemen in the traffic is not so urgent. 

After treating this subject, I see that this is a huge problem and that it can not be easily solved. People like driving and people like driving fast. The motorways are big and the cars feel safe so there should not be a problem, many seem to think. But what if suddenly, a rabbit jumps out in front of the car?",0
2,0102.a2.txt,"I've chosen a rather complex topic, the Internet, for this essay. It is a topic that is disscussed all over the world. There is a ongoing debate about if it is good or bad. I'm going to argue, as it says in the title, that the Internet is the garden of Eden and not the Hades. I'm very aware of the arguments against it. Everyone of the arguments for the Internet, that I'm going to present, have ""dark"" sides as well. I know that there are a lot of arguments for the Internet but I'm only going to use the arguments that I think are the most important.","The most obvious argument for the Internet is the information. It is an enormous bank of information and it's not just one kind of information that you can find there. There are webpages with information about cooking, music, how to travel in Tibet, how to improve your cleaning of the bathroom and the list can go on for many, many pages. A wide range of information have become available for a rather large part of the world's population(for the population of the industrialized countries anyway). I think that is good for I belive that people can't have too much information and it is the individual that should decide which information he or she wants to take part of and not the government. The only time the government should act are in the extreme cases like childpornography and other crimes. The Internet has made it really easy to look for and find information. You only(?) have to have access to a computer and a modem and then you can surf the Net. It is much easier than having to go to the library which maybe is located a couple of mils from your home. The Internet makes it possible for people to find information that they would have a hard time to find anywhere else, especially nowadays when for example many musicians release music over the Net which can't be found anywhere else and if you are a music freak like me then you just got to have access to Internet. 

There is a really social side to the Internet as well even if it seems like a contradiction in terms. Many people is using the Net to talk with other people from all over the world. You can meet persons that you normally wouldn't meet, I mean how often do I meet people from, for example Singapore, in the ""real"" world? You can discuss different topics in groups with people that you never met before or discuss with only one person in special chat rooms who are designed for that purpose. I have seen in the newspapers that people who met over the Internet have gotten married. I think that's proof enough that the Internet is a good thing. I mean think of the people who live in unpopulated parts of the world, Internet gives them a better chance to find someone interesting. I'm of course well aware of the persons that have been injured or even killed when they have met people who they found over the Internet. But I think that this have and will unfortunately happen with every kind of medium. I think that the Internet makes the world a smaller place to live on.

A related thing is shopping and that has really had a big boom during the last years. You can buy just about everything over the Internet like music, books, food, clothes and so on. The good thing about this is that the stores on the Internet have better prices because they have less expenses than usual stores. The competition makes the ordinary stores lower their prices as well and that is very good for us consumers. There isn't only shopping which is very big on the Internet, the service side has grown as well. There are insurance companies, food-deliverers and ""Arbetsf√∂rmedlingen"" has their own site where you can look at the job-advertisements from all over Sweden. If think that this sector is going to grow much bigger on the Internet. 

I think that the Internet will grow much bigger and better in the years to come mainly because of technical improvements like better modems and such. Internet will have a larger impact on people's lives than it has today especially people in unpopulated areas like ""Norrland"" in Sweden.",0
3,0103.a2.txt,Physical Education - An Investment for Life,"The Swedish public health in is danger. We are getting fatter and fatter thanks to the modern technology that is taking over our world. More and more hours are used up in front of our computers, surfing on the Internet, playing games, making bank errands, almost anything is possible, if not to say everything. We do not have to take many steps a day to live a very convenient life. Our children take the bus to school; they walk between the classrooms, when they get home they move between the TV and the computer. They do not get the exercise that is essential for a good and wholesome life. At the same time the number of hours of physical education in school is decreasing, I see that as a big threat to our children's health in the future. If we want our next generation to have a good physical condition, we must give them these extra hours.

Many children are spending their spare time playing video games and watching TV, they are living a more and more sedentary life. Sport is getting less significant in the computer world that is growing with a tremendous speed today. It is important to get our children to understand that physical education is not only about chasing a ball, running the fastest, jumping the highest or throwing the longest. But it also concerns the teaching of how our body is functioning, how to eat healthy and to take care of ourselves. Studies have shown that the average weight for 15-year-olds has increased with 3-4 kilos during this last decade. For a growing child it is of a big importance to be physically active. In lack of bodily activity, the muscle mass gets reduced; the condition changes for the worse, the skeleton gets more fragile and the flexibility decreases. Several of our most frequent diseases are related to physical inactivity for example heart and vascular disorders, diabetes, fatness and joint- and back problems. 

The number of children joining local sport clubs is declining, so for many kids and youths the only exercise they get is that what they get in school. According to studies made by the Swedish Sports Confederation, the hours of physical education have decreased in 75% of the elementary schools, and in 70% of the senior high schools. To compensate for the cuts, the school boards are giving the students the possibility to take sports as an individual choice. But this only attracts those who are interested in sport and health, and who are generally already involved in some activity outside school. This opportunity does not appeal to those who really are in need for physical education, but hate it. They will, of course, choose another curriculum. So to reach to those who do not like the subject, it must be compulsory with physical education. In school, children get the chance to try on different kind of sports and physical activities. Things they possibly would not get in touch with otherwise. So the more hours of physical education, the more hours for discovering an activity that suits each and every one, and hopefully will lead to a continuing exercising.

Physical education also improves the studying. It is difficult to sit in school through six classes of theoretical subjects and stay concentrated. Many children suffer from headaches. Often caused by lack of fresh air, bad school environment, eating food that is not nutritious or eating nothing at all. If we could make these students see the importance of exercising and eating nutritiously they would do better in school. They get healthier, they stay awake during class and it gets easier for them to focus on their assignments. Studies show that a good physical condition improves the results in school. To take a break from all the facts that are squeezed in one's head, and to do something completely different can only lead to a positive result, students will pay more attention in class and will be willing to learn more.

I would say that our children's health are very much dependant upon the physical education they get in school. If we take away from them, these very valuable hours of exercise, the chances for them to get serious illnesses increases, it will get harder for them to be concentrated and focused in class, they will live an unhealthy life, and we do not want that for our children.",0
4,0104.a2.txt,To be or not be (a vegetarian),"Dustin Hoffman, Bob Dylan and Chelsea Clinton all have one thing in common and that is the fact that they are vegetarians. Why have they, and many with them, decided to exclude meat from their menus? We don't know what the reasons were behind their decisions, but there are many reasons why people choose to become vegetarians and I will write about some of them in this essay. There are lots of good arguments for being a vegetarian and among the many reasons are beliefs about ethics, culture, health, religion, economics, world hunger, and the environment. 
The first thing that strike me is the way the animals are treated by us humans, and Alice Walker once said ""The animals of the world exist for their own reasons. They were not made for humans any more than black people were made for white, or women created for men."" This is something to think about when we treat animals the way we do. Do we really have that right? I'll leave that question unanswered, but the way animals are transported is not defendable and you might have seen on the news a few years ago how cruel animal transports were and still are. If that wouldn't be enough; many animals are forced to live unnatural lives, where they never see the sky and they are crammed into far too small living spaces, just to have it ended without any form of anaesthetic. This isn't always the case, but in far too many cases this is the bitter truth. 
An other thing that might be an important factor for choosing this lifestyle is that research show that vegetarians' health is better, and that they live longer than other people. A too large consumption of meat causes fatness, hardening of the arteries, high blood-pressure, several forms of cancer, diabetes, gout, brittleness of the bones among other things. You won't get all of this just because you eat meat, but the risk of getting it increases. It is absolutely possible to get necessary vitamins, minerals, and protein from non-meat sources. Sure, the human digestive system is adaptable and can handle small amounts of meats, but my point is that if we choose to become vegetarians, we will be on our way to a healthier lifestyle.
Furthermore, thousands of people die every day from starvation. At the same time a third of the world's crop become animal food - in the U.S. as much as seventy percent. Fifteen vegetarians can be fed on the amount of land needed to produce a meat-centered diet for one person. The food that could be saved if people became vegetarians would be enough to feed the starving people in the world. But if we continue as we've done before, the energy is lost that could save the world from hunger. Sooner or later it's likely that we all have to become vegetarians, either we want to or not. 
Another argument talking for vegetarianism is that it's beneficial for the environment. We are six billion people on this planet now, and all of us can't eat meat, since nature can't take that much stress. In order for people to eat meat; livestock must be fed and housed and the products refrigerated, which requires great amounts of resources. Production of a certain amount of energy or protein in the form of meat is harder on the resources than production of the same amount of energy or protein in the form of vegetables. A vegetarian diet requires far less water, and decreasing the population of livestock would reduce pollution from manure and animal wastes.
So it's of my opinion that it's not morally defendable to cause environmental pollution and suffering for millions of animals if we don't have to, and if we can find the key to better health and an answer to the world hunger at the same time that's just great. But in the end it's of course up to everyone to make their own decisions if they want to be a vegetarian or not, but I hope I have given you something to think about next time you sit down at the dinner table.",0
5,0105.a2.txt,UNPAID WORK FOR UNEMPLOYED?,"Many people might think that forcing unemployed people out to do unpaid work for the public sector would be degrading or even cruel, but I think that most people whohave been unemployed for a longer time would infact welcome this opportunity. Not only because of the obvious fact that they will get some work experience but also to get out and meet people and feel useful. For the public sector this would also be posetiv since they at present are terribly understaffed but also have no money to employ more people.
Today I would say that there are two types of people that are unemployed who would benifit from this, first the person who does not want to have a job but thinks that beeing at home, doing nothing and at the same time collecting unemployment benefits is pretty neat. In this case I do not think that the person in question himself would benefit so much from having to work unpaid, but instead the society would. First for the obvious reason that the person would do a community service but more important: I think that in many cases these people would probably rather go out and try to find themselves a better job and thereby not be dependent upon the government. 
The second type is the ones who might have poor education and little or no work experience. For these people I think this is a wounderful solution because the three most common worries for them are; they become isolated from the outside world when they have to stay at home to apply for jobs or wait for telephonecalls from jobs they have applied for. They can also feel that they have nothing in common with the people who actually do have a job. Secondly they feel that they do not contribute to society and to many people, especially they who are a little bit older and who are used to have worked unrelentlessly all their lives, this might be a huge problem. Last but not least is the problem that they are not improving their situation, by this I mean that the longer you are unemployed the harder it is to get a new employment since many companies nowdays tend to wounder why you have not had a job. 
As far as the public sector itself is concerned hardly a day goes by without you hearing on the news about the lack of people and money. This would be easily helped by this system. One good example is the hospitals who are understaffed which leads to the maltreatment of patients, why not instead bring in people who might be qualified for some easier work to offload the nurse and let her consentrate on more important duties that requires the expertise she posesses. Work like making beds, changing bed- pans, easier office-work or maybe just keeping the elderly company for a couple of hours a day. Same thing applies to the police-force where there is much argument about the police-officers themselves having to do their own paper-work. I am sure that there are many unemployed today who have skills enough to do this kind of work and if you do not there are always more unqualified work such as park maintenance and such. 
Of course there is problems with this system aswell. Problems such as the added bureaucracy that this will inevitably bring and which, in my own opinion, is already a huge problem in Sweden today. And also a number of questions appear, for instance; what do you do if an unemployed person does not do his job well, do you have the right to fire that person; how long are you suppose to stay at one job if unable to find a regular job; how do you decide who is qualifed for a certain job and who decides this: the employer or the unemployment-agency.
Another legitimate question is whether it would not be better to give these people a proper job since you have to pay them either way. And obviously this would be the solution that I also would prefere but our politicians today seem to think that we can not afford this even though these people are being paid by them either way. But I say give these people their jobs and thereby also their dignity.",0
6,0106.a2.txt,Financing studies - Sweden vs. Finland,"When I first moved to Sweden to start at the university I soon got aware of the huge difference between the systems of financing your studies in this country and my own, namely Finland, or the √Öland islands. I was astonished by the fact that my fellow students were given approximately twice as much money as I every month, and, of course, this was a bit upsetting. Having had a bit more insight into how the Swedish system actually works, I am, however, relieved to be excluded from it. In my opinion the Finnish system is a lot better than the Swedish one.

The system used in Finland for financing studies is in many ways different from the one used in Sweden. One difference is that the amount of money actually given to you is higher, amounting to approximately 2400 crowns a month. You also get an accommodation grant which can amount to 1500 crowns. In addition to this you are able to loan up to 30,000 crowns a year from the bank since the community stands security for you. This is, in short, how the Finnish system works, and I think there are quite a few factors in favour of it.
Firstly, the amount of money granted to you, that is, not loaned to you, is much higher than in Sweden. Since you get almost four thousand crowns every month you don't have to take as big loans as in Sweden, where you have to loan quite high amounts of money to get by. If you have a good sense of economy (and a reasonable rent), with the Finnish system you can even get by without loans, something that is next to impossible in Sweden.

The second very good thing with the Finnish system when comparing it to the Swedish one, is that if you are going to take a loan you do it directly from your own bank. When you have applied for student support you get a paper sent to you granting you money for the coming semester. When you want to loan money you simply take this paper to the bank, decide how much money you want, and the amount will be in your bank account the same day. Consequently, you don't have to get into trouble with any administrative institutions like the CSN in Sweden; instead you have a direct contact with the bank.

My final argument in favour of the Finnish student support system is also, in my opinion, the most important one, regarding both the individual and the community as a whole.
Whereas in Sweden, students who have taken loans only have to pay off these until retirement, with a fixed percentage every month, students taking loans in Finland are obliged to pay back every penny of theirs. As soon as you get a job, or within two years after finishing your studies, you have to start paying back. The rate put down every month is dependent on how high your loan is, and on the size of your salary. The idea is that you are to pay back the loan within a period twice as long s that of your studies, but you can, in fact, get a few years extra if needed. You also get released from the payment if you lose your job, but as soon as you are employed again you have to continue the down payments. This system is a great deal better than the Swedish one since the money loaned to students are actually paid back. The Swedish system results in tremendous amounts of money ""disappearing"", since very few students manage to pay back their whole debts.

Being a temporary ""immigrant"" in this country I have realized that there are quite a few differences between the Swedish way of things compared to that of my home country. One of the most obvious features of Sweden, in my opinion, is the tendency to make everything a bit more difficult than necessary, especially when it comes to administrative areas, and I think this tendency has come to its climax in dealing with student support. I know I'm not the only one who thinks the Swedish student financing system doesn't work very well and there is a continuous debate dealing with this problem, so I really hope that, in a near future, someone will come up with a satisfying solution. As we have in Finland.",0
7,0107.a2.txt,Stop commercial breaks on television,"""I declare war, against split ends and damage hair"", ""Gillette, the best a man can get"". There are many examples of commercial phrases that television provides us with. According me, they are neither good or necessary and destroy my comfortable evenings in front of the television. I think commercial should be removed from the televisionscreen so everyone can choose what they want to watch.
In the first place, commercial on television conduce to annoying breaks you actually do not need or want. After twenty minutes of a good film I am not in a mood to be interrupted; probably I just got hang of the action. During the breaks you often switch over to another channel and you might get interested in that program instead. Is that what television commercial is meant for, for us to switch over? Sometimes it also happens that you forget to get back to the first program in time because the breaks are very unsettled and you never know if they will last for two or five minutes. An impatient atmosphere often occurs and it is also sometimes difficult to get back in the action after been doing other things for a moment.
In the second place, television commercial makes people dislike products because of the way we get introduced to them. I would feel stupid to call ""Via direct"" and I would never buy Ajax products because I know people do not clean their houses dressed up with a happy face as the woman in the commercial and I do not want to look so ridiculous as she does. It is so pathetic so I can not believe in what they assert. I have had enough of comments like ""because I am worth it"" and I rather use shampoos, make up and other products which are not so overrated.
Finally, I will account for the main argument why I think commercial should be removed from our televisionscreens. This kind of commercial is not realistic, it directs chiefly to women and it often alludes to sex. The nuclear family with members look like supermodels, teeth which are white and shining and look plastic because of some chewing gum or toothpaste and mothers who do the washing, smiling and laughing - is this the picture of society we want to give children and young people of today? As a woman I can sometimes feel humiliated because of all these false messages. I think in particularly of the one when good looking women are cheering and clapping during a race for their dishcloths. I do not want to be described in such a naiv and unintelligent way and it does not appeal to me at all. I often wonder how smart the persons that create these commercials are, do they think at all? As a consumer I know that my hair will not be shiny and fluffy just like in the commercial, I understand that the advertising film does not show or tell the whole true and that special effects are used. If I buy a product it is because of the price or if I like it, not because Kate Moss tells me to use it. The ""sextheme"" is very popular today so even in commercials. JC tried to sell a sexy attitude last year where teenagers were sitting in the grass and started their foreplay. You could not hardly see the clothes, instead you felt the exiting atmosphere and saw their desire for love in their faces. When teenagers who buy their clothes see this kinds of commercials I think they get a wrong view of what love and life in that age is all about but when it comes around they like to wear JC cloths because it gives them the right (in this case sexy) image. 
I do not mean that all commercial is bad even though I think most of it is worthless. Still, it influences us more than we can imagine. Even if I am aware of the commercials' purpose to try and affect us, it still gets to me somehow and especially television commercial because we get picture and sound at the same time. I know that some channels need to have commercial breaks; it is a big part of their financing and important money. But, I have got a solution, or a compromise; if commercial has to be on, show it after and before instead of interrupt during programs. When I and many others take place in front of the television it is because we want to relax, be entertained, stimulate our interests and not to get irritated. I want to make my own choices, even when it comes to television programs.",0
8,0109.a2.txt,Thou shall not kill,"Men and women have sex. Sometimes this love-making leads to pregnancy, sometimes not. Some women have no difficulty reaching a decision to keep the child, while others, depending on different circumstances, chooses to go through an abortion. Maybe these women are very young, maybe they are in other diffucult situations of life. Whatever the causes really are ain't that important since abortion is lawful. That's the case in Sweden, and that's the U.S. Supreme Court interpretation of the Constitution. Nevertheless there are dark clouds appearing on the American sky. Aggressive anti-abortion movements, often Christian, for example God's Army are using violence against the doctors who, on requests by the pregnant womens, carries out the abortions. Seven doctors have so far been killed, and many others has been injured or threatened. With this essay I would like to discuss these radical movements, and I will try to answer to some of the arguments, which these movements have in an attempt to justify the use of violence.
A documentary, recently shown on Swedish television, dealt with this violence. I was terrified in the ways the radical antagonists was convinced that their violence was justified. One pastor of a church told that he had learned all his children, at the age of one, which finger was the trigger-finger. He considered it important knowing how to use weapons in the right way. And I, who always have believed that Christianity took a stand against violence. He also thought that abortion doctors were murderers, but those who killed the doctors shouldn't be seen as murderers, instead as saviours of life. I have a lot to say about these statements of his. I feel a sense of double morality in their believe. 

Shouldn't every murder be seen as a murder, or is it up to the individuals to decide? And I also wonder where in the Holy Scripture it reads that it's okey to murder in some cases. Have the movement forgot the Decalogue. As I recall it, isn't one of the commandments:""Thou shall not kill""? One of the antagonists provided the discussion with a further dimension, in his attempt to justify their use of violence. He questionned, with a self-satisfied expression on his face, whether if someone would have shot Adolf Hitler would have been seen as a killer? Once again, hasn't every murder have to be seen as a murder? But his statement was interesting to this discussion. If Hitler, for certain a real jerk, wouldn't had committed suicide, he surely would have been seen as responsible for the ethnic cleansing in World War II. He would have been seen as responsible for the death of million lives. He surely would have been convicted as a murder, although he probably never killed any human being with his own hands. He had those who executed his orders. Would it then be okay to kill every man who worked for Hitler? Or is it okay to kill every single soldier who has been involved in wars? Most humans would agree with me that it would be wrong to kill the soldiers, who are only obeying order. And if that's the case, how could it right to kill the doctors? They are only doing what the pregnant mothers are ordering them to do. I hope you have reached the same conclusion as I have, that abortion should be a decision for the women to take. That decision is hard enough to take, even without aggressive movements using violence, terrifying the doctors. In this essay I have tried to show that their use of violence cannot be justified, and I have tried to show that their arguments are quite weak.

9,0110.a2.txt,Time is all we got!,"Why are working people in Sweden so stressed? Why do many people feel they cannot fullfill everyones expectations? The demands upon people of today are enormous. In my essay I intend to argue in favor of a reduced working-hour week, not only for parents of small children but for everyone.

Most people try to adapt to reality of everyday-life. When people work a forty-hour week it is easy to see that time is really limited. You are forced to make choices, in order to master the demands made from different individuals. Some people are devoted to their work and therefore neglect their family, while other's usually women choose to care for the children and therefore they will not be first on the list for promotion. Having children and making a career at the same time is very hard. Everyone tries to find a balance in their week-days, but this goal is very difficult to achieve.

Sressrelated diseases are very common in the Western World today. It is in fact a rapedly growing problem. Daily we can read about people suffering from different types of stressymptoms like sleepingproblems, headaces, digestionproblems, e.g. Most people learn to live with theese symptoms, but some neglect themselves and try to manage by using sedatives or alcohol. Patients who have suffered from a nervous break-down, or heartattack have been forced to rearrange their lifestyles as well as their values of life. Reading these stories makes it very clear to me that we have to reduce our working-hour week in order to benifit ourselves as well as our fellow-beings. I know from my own experiense that some people discuss their situation in a way that it sounds like they are in full control of everything, but I think that is mission impossible. Others talk about their time they spend with their children as quality-time. I believe time is what is quality when it comes down to familyrelations.

Looking at this question from a different angle, I think a six-hour workingday would benifit employers. It is common knowledge that employees who work parttime are rarely sick. Early retirement would also diminish in number as a result of this reform. That would save a lot of money for the health-insurance office. Studies in Finland have shown that people who worked six hours a day still produce as much as those who work a full forty- hour week. If people work six hours a day it would be possible to have a flexible schedule. That would make it easier for people to have a much greater influence of how their working day could look like. This has also a positive effect on peoples health. Some people might want to start early, while others want to sleep in and start their day a bit later. It would furthermore make it easier to find time to run errands we all have to do e.g. going to the bank, dentistappointment and so on. Opinion-polls that have taken place in Sweden have shown that most people are in favour of a shorter workingday instead of a payraise. Next period of agreement conserning the local government employees this issue will be raised. 

That is a step in the right direction as far as i am concerned. Today a lot of people look at their working-week as a distance to be transported inbetween week-ends. By the time people have holidays, there are generally demand on everyone to make up for lost time with family and friends. I believe that we are deceiving ourselves. I think we ought to reconsider matters and try to seize a chance of living in a more satisfactory way everyday.

Some people might argue that people worked much harder in the older days.That is true, but despite that I do not think that people lived under the constant strain that we experience now in our fast moving consumer society.Therefore my conclusion is that politicians should take measures to improve the living conditions for its citizens. This would be a step in the right direction to promote equality between men and women, as well as a more humane society.",0
10,0111.a2.txt,How do you justify executions?,"Three quarters of all states in America has the death penalty. Many people think that it is a fair and well functioning punishment, but I think the opposite. Who are we, ordinary people to decide who is going to live, and who is not? In this essay I will describe how very wrong it is to have a punishment like the death penalty in USA, and what I believe can replace it.

How do you justify taking an other humans life? No matter what crime he or she has committed, no one on earth should have the power to decide about life or death. There is just no logic here. People supporting the death penalty claim that if you have taken an other persons life, you do not have the right to live anymore. But who decides that? Isn't execution proving the opposite? By taking a persons life we show that you are not allowed to kill. This is as illogic as it sounds, moreover it is a savage act and something that a modern country like America should have abandoned a long time ago. 

Sadly the question of death penalty or not have lately been focused on money rather than on human rights. People advocating the cruel punishment often argue that it is cheaper to execute people than to put them in jail for life time. Of course it coast money to keep criminals behind bars, however it also coast a lot of money having the prisoner waiting in jail for execution, and for he or she to appeal the sentence. 

Often when there are debates involving the death penalty you hear words like money and politics. People in general tend to forget about the most important issue namely that execution is a cruel punishment. A convicted felony usually sit a long time in prison before he or she is being executed. The weeks, months and very often years in the cell are periods of uncertainty and anxiety for the prison. Sometimes there is a decided date for the execution, but by appealing that date can sometimes be changed. Life for a person sentenced to death is very much like a roller coaster. Their situation is inhuman.

Many of those being executed in USA are just teenagers. The execution of these kids who has had a bad start in life, and never have had the chance to create and participate in a normal life does not solve any problems. On the contrary it only creates new ones because I think that death penalties and executions helps to brutalise the society.

But what are we going to do with the criminals? Set them free? Off course not. Many of the prisoners needs to stay in jail, and they need to be watched over 24 hours a day. However there are many of the prisoners who can be trained to become functioning, well adjusted citizens. There are rehabilitation programs in USA that have very satisfying results and which have helped a lot of criminals to deal with their problems and to change their lives. These programs may coast a little more than to just switch on the electricity on the electric chair, but once again money should not be an issue when it comes to preserve human lives. 

So, what can we do? Are we going to allow people, very often youths to be executed, meanwhile we know that it exist rehabilitation programs that could help criminals back to a new start in life? Are we going to tolerate that execution is being chosen instead of this because of economic reasons? Humans are certainly not meant to play some sort of gods and when we do that it is wrong, terribly wrong.",0
11,0112.a2.txt,The Right To Children,"In Sweden today, it is impossible for homosexuals to adopt a child legally. Yet, some people act against the law and find one way or another to have children to raise and love. There is no proof that such children, raised by homosexual parents, should suffer from it. From the children's point of view, I see no reason for not letting homosexuals be parents. What really hampers the society's development towards a more equal and fair society is simply people's prejudices.

Still, some prejudiced people cannot accept homosexual people as normal human beings. They claim that homosexuality is due to experiences early in life, and some even claim it is an illness or a minor brain damage. Others just think homosexuals should not be allowed to adopt children because they feel it is not suitable for children to grow up in any other family than the nuclear family. This is probably due to the thought that the traditional family responds to the children's need for both men and women in their surroundings.

A child needs both male and female role models. This can be used as an argument againt parents comprising two people of the same sex. Unfortunately, in many families good female and male role models are not provided by the mother and father. The number of single-parent families is increasing, and in some families where the parents still live together, one or both of the parents are unable to influence their children, one reason could be too much absence. However, this does usually not mean that these children grow up without role models, since there are relatives, teachers and friends of the parents' in most children's environments. This proves that having two mothers or fathers, does not at all mean a more unbalanced view. Actually, homosexual parents is probably more aware of the problems that might appear and are more anxious to find solutions. Nevertheless, it is the welfare of the children concerned that really matters. 

The fact that an incredible number of children in the world today suffer from malnutricion and abuse is not new to anyone. With this in mind, it seems obvious that these children would undoubtedly be better off with good, loving parents, hetrosexuals or not. It is most upsetting that small children die because no one takes care of them, when there are people who want to. For this reason, letting homosexual couples adopt children, would be to act in favour of the children. Furthermore, on the contrary to what some opponents believe, investigations show that children raised by homosexual parents develops into perfectly normal people. 

What is often heard as an arguement against homosexuals as parents is that the children of such parents will be bullied and harassed in school. What I think makes this argument untenable is mainly two facts: Children are bullied by other children because of all sorts of things; being overwheight, red-headed or not being able to pronounce a proper ""s"" or ""r"". Also, Children's behaviour depends much on the adults' behaviour. Therefore, the responsibility is the adults' around the children. They should respect and support homosexuals as they do others, and in that way be good role models.

Unfortunately, the Swedish authorities do not show respect and support for homosexuals sufficiently. The rules about adoption sais that a hetrosexual couple or a person without a partner, who seem suitable to be parents according to the authorities investigation, can adopt a child. For a person who has a partner, but of the same sex, it is impossible. In my opinion these rules are in conflict with all logic and common sense, but also the law. These rules discriminate people simply because of their sexuality, but as everybody knows, it is illegal to discriminate people on sexuality basis. By applying such rules, the authorities demonsrate that it is not fully accepted to be homosexual. This is nothing but a disgrace to Sweden, since we are famous for cherishing equality.

To conclude, the authorities have no valid reason for taking away normal people's right to have children. The rules about adoption are out of date, and based on old prejudices. Many people have nothing against homosexual people, but feel that the society is not ready for such a change of family construction. But why should both starving children and people longing for them have to wait for other citizens to accustom themselves to a more openminded society?",0
12,0113.a2.txt,MORE MEN ARE NEEDED IN THE CHILD-CARE SYSTEM,"When I am writing this, it is the beginning of March 1999 and in one of the cities of Sweden, something terrible has happened, something that fills the whole country with horror. A twenty-two year old man who was working as a child-minder, has during a few years, abused several children sexually and also produced an enormous amount of child pornographic material. Of course, what everybody is asking themselves right now is; what kind of a sick creature is capable to do something like that? As always after such a scandal, people start to question the motives of the men working with child-care. Worried mothers might wonder if he really has to touch the children that much and what are his intentions of following them to the bathroom? I have understood, after reading some interviews in the morning papers, that many of the men working at the day-care centers today are feeling observed by suspicious eyes, as if there would be something abnormal of being a man working with children. I find attitudes like that to be in most cases absolutely unfounded and instead I do believe that it is very important to make a greater number of men start working in the child-care system. Here below I will give an account of my main arguments for thinking so.

Today, the overwhelming majority, or 95 percent, of the people working with childcare in Sweden are women. This are usually quite low-paid jobs and I do believe that there is a connection between that and the fact that it is a work sector dominated by women. Sweden is said to be one of the most equal countries in the world, but still typical female jobs, like nursing and pree-scool teaching are paid less than typical male jobs. Why is this then? I would suggest that it depends much on the way it traditionally have been; the women were staying at home, taking care of the children while the men were working. Perhaps the women working in the child-care system today too easily have accepted being low-paid, just because they traditionally have been taking care of the children without being paid at all. Since most politicians and employers historically also have been men, they might have been favouring occupations dominated by their own sex. I am convinced that if more men were working in the child-care system, it would soon result in demands for higher wages and would in a long term view create a more equal working situation. I find the child-care system to be an essential part of our society and therefore I feel that it is of great importance that the jobs are attractive for well-educated people. I do believe that more men employed would make the politicians improve the situation sooner.

My second main argument is that I believe all children need reliable men in their every-day environment. Especially today, when there are so many children having an absent father, living with a single mother. I have no doubt that the majority of single mothers are doing a brilliant job, but they cannot be a father as well as a mother. Of course no man can replace a child's real father, but I am convinced that having good male role models around, help children in their own development and in future relationships. A better balance between the number of men and women working at the day-care centers would make the children grow up and see that childcare is not a duty reserved only for women, which would lead to children growing up with more equal attitudes.

The debate lately about incest and pedophils has resulted in people becoming suspicious and several cases of suspected incest have been brought up both by media and in court. I believe a lot of people find it difficult to decide what is normal behaviour and what is not. Incest is one of the worst crimes anybody can commit and naturally we should all continue to be attentive if we have the slightest suspicion of a child being abused. What we can not do is allowing these suspicions to go too far, after all most men would not dream about hurting a child. I claim that more men are needed in the child-care system to show that it is perfectly normal for men to take care of children and that there is nothing perverse or strange about it. More men working as child-minders would probably make it easier to recognize abnormal behaviour and help us not to mix it with truly innocent contact. The few monsters abusing children should not be allowed to lay guilt on all men and scare them from working with and taking care of children.",0
13,0115.a2.txt,License To Pay- the price of state television,"In Sweden of today people are forced to pay a license for the possession of a television set. This license is obligatory and you will receive a fine if you do not pay or fail to register yourself as an owner of a television set. The license is paid per household and there is no difference whether you have one or several television sets or other kinds of receivers, the amount paid is still the same. The cost of the license is decided upon by the government and is currently around twelve hundred Swedish crowns per year. The money collected through these licenses are used to fund the state owned television and radio channels. This system has been the same for many years and it can no longer be defended as necessary, not even justified. There are alternative ways to fund a television channel, most common is the selling of commercial, which should be preferred instead of licenses.
When this system was initially made into law some decades ago, Sweden had only one broadcasting television channel and it was the only one you could watch. Therefore at that time owning a television set meant you probably watched that channel. The easiest way to fund the television broadcasting was then to charge every owner of a television set. Although, today the broadcasting market is totally different. There are up to a hundred different television channels, most run through satellite broadcasting. It is therefore fully possible to have and use a television set without ever watching the state owned channels. Still, you have to pay the cost of running these two channels, a cost which you might never get anything out of paying. The other channels available today are usually funded by commercials, which make them dependent on the number of people watching. If they have less viewers then they will sell less commercial time, which gives them less funding. This is not the case for the state owned channels as they are guaranteed their funding no matter how many viewers they have. This makes the competition between broadcasting companies unfair and in favor of certain channels.
Instead, it would be much more fair if the state owned channels, as all other channels, also relied on commercial funding. This system is much more fair towards everyone, both broadcasting companies and watchers. It is often argued that the state owned channels are the only commercial free channels and that people want to keep them like that. This might have been true a few years back, but today the most popular channel is TV4, a commercial channel. Therefore, commercials on television can not be that unpopular among the majority of today. The fact that the state owned channels are no longer the most watched channels also creates the problem that the commercial funding might not be sufficient enough.
This can be solved rather easy though, as a change in the program tabloid of state owned television could easily bring back many watchers which have been lost to commercial channels. Through broadcasting more popular shows, enough watchers would be gathered for the ability of commercial funding to be made possible. Critics might say that this can not be done, as state owned television have a responsibility to broadcast a diversity of shows which will allow for all viewers to watch. Although, this argument is only justified by the fact that all viewers have been forced to pay for these channels. If no one was forced to pay for them, state television would not have the responsibility of broadcasting such a diversity of shows. Rather, they could concentrate on broadcasting shows which the majority would want to watch.
As state owned television today have the possibility to go over to commercial funding, there is no reason to force people to pay for the funding of state owned channels. To take away the possibility of choice from the viewers is a violence of the free will. The guaranteed funding for selected channels creates an unfair competition situation, which does not belong in a democratic country like Sweden. The system of television licenses should therefore be abandoned, as it applies to a situation which is no longer present in Sweden.",0
14,0118.a2.txt,slavery system of modern times,"To force people to do unpaid work in the public sector to receive unemployed benefit, I think indicate a very cynical outlook of unemployed people. If jobs exists within the public sector people should be employed and get proper paid for their work. If on the other hand the jobs will be created just to serve the purpose of keeping unemployed people bussy and the assignments are not enough important to employ people to do them. That would be a even more condescending way of treating people. If the first condition is the applicable and you carry matters to an extreme, it would ultimately be to force people to reduce their own abilitys of getting a real job. Though in both the cases i think that coerce people to work in order to get their uneployment benefit would be a slavery system of modern times.
Forcing people to take a unpaid job it's to questoning their ability to decide for their own good. I also think that it's a way of questioning peoples character, thinking that they would just lay back and don't make any efforts to improve their situation if they weren't forced to do otherwise. I think on the whole that the state should be very carefully with interfering to much within peoples life. Peoples which prefer to use their time they have when they are unemployed to search jobs, improve their skills in different areas, or just be thinking of what they want to do with their future, should have that ability.
When you get unemployed you commonly loose a great deal of your selfconfidence and your human dignity, if you than are being forced to work more or less for free, with something that you doesn't feel happy with and which doesn't suit your personality, it doesn't exactly raise your self-confidence or inspire you in any positive way.
I also believe that there's a risk, if the first thing you have to do when you become unemployed is to begin to work full-time in the public sector, that after a while you don't feel that you have the strenght of both working full-time and search for a new jobb. My own experience, of have being unemployed and worked for ""free"" in the public sector (My own choise), is that in a coupel of months you don't have the energy or motivation to search jobs very actively. And this observance also applys to other unemployed people I've met. Though I think that the unemployed people who wants to do unpaid work should have the opportunity to do that. But considering that it can be easier to search for jobs when you have more time for it, a legislation that you in order to get the unemployment benefit must work for ""free"", would make it even harder for some people to get a real job. 
The good thing about unemployed people working in the public sector would be that they get some work experience and references. But than again, if the work is really nessecary to be done why not employ unemloyed people instead of using them as free worker, and give them the money and security that comes with a real job. Otherwise It's like saying that the work people are forced to do haven't got any real value. 
To sum up I think the idea of forcing people to work in the public sector in order to get their unemployment benefit would be a encroachment that doesn't belong in a free and democratic society. You shouldn't underestimate peoples power of initiative and ambition to improve their situation. And you also have to consider that unemployed people are individuals with different needs so you can't apply just one solution to the problem with unemployment, it would be to simplificate a very complexed issue.",0
15,0119.a2.txt,Reduce the number of entering foreigners,"In this essay I will argue for a change in our politics dealing with foreigners. I want Sweden to reduce the number of persons who get the permission to stay each year. Of course I don't want this to be a permanent change, just for a couple of years so that we are able to produce a system that works, in the dealing with foreigners. I think that our community has developed in a bad direction due to the huge number of foreigners entering Sweden each year. My opinion is that Sweden at present has a situation we can't handle in the communication between foreigners and those who have Swedish as a native language. I believe we must do something about this before the problem grows stronger and to reduce the number of entering foreigners for a few years can be one solution.

 One of my arguments for this reduction is that we today can't help refugees to the point I think is necessary for handling such a situation properly. This has led to a high criminality among foreigners. Many of them come here with heavy memories and difficulties in adjusting to a completely new country, with its language, habits and culture. I don't think it's strange that problems arise and lead to criminality, which is the case of many foreigners, especially for young men. The fact that many of the crimes in Sweden are made by these people, don't make it easier for Swedes to accept those not born here. Negative feelings about foreigners have increased as a result and many in Sweden have developed into racists. One frightening aspect of this is the big amount of people who are ""invisible"" in their disliking of refugees, that is, people who don't go out with their thoughts in public. I don't think that so much must happen before their feelings increase. I can refer to myself in this situation because I've become more hostile to refugees in the last few years; due to things I've seen and heard about them. The place where I live has changed since we got a refugee camp and there is much more violence now than for a few years ago. 
Another bad aspect with this minority group of criminal foreigners is that they make it harder for the other nice foreigners. The well-behaved foreigners get in trouble because of the bad reputation of the criminal ones and can meet resistance in society. 

I feel like Sweden is moving in a vicious circle that we don't try to break. We now see us in a situation that will soon blow of like a bomb. I therefore insist that we must reduce the number of foreigners, who get the opportunity to stay in this country, while we can't take care of those already here. Sweden doesn't have the ability to take care of people, who come in despair, fear and hope for a safe place. We can't do like now, that is, place them in some refugee camp until they know they have the permission to stay. This process can take an incredible time and to be rejected a stay after for example six years is very cruel and unfair. There must be a way to shorten this waiting period. 

Another aspect, which I find extremely important, is that we should try to integrate foreigners in society and give them a chance to live as we do. With this I mean Sweden should avoid establishing suburbs for foreigners, where the opportunities of developing are smaller than in an area with people of both Swedish and non-Swedish cultures. It's important to make people from different cultures meet each other and learn the others valuations and way of life. We must avoid creating a society where it is divided into them and we as it becomes when people live in different areas and maybe go to different schools.

My opinion is therefore that Sweden during some years must draw down on the number of refugees getting a permission to stay here. The main argument for this is that I think we've got a situation we can't manage, with far too much criminality, when we don't have the opportunities to take care of all foreigners already living here.",0
16,0120.a2.txt,Why work?,"Unemployment is a burning issue in many countries. In Sweden unemployment is the cause of a lot of problems the country is facing., and is a major issue in every general election. 
There are a lot of questions I ask myself concerning unemployment in Sweden:
 Is it really fair that some people are choosing to be unemployed because they make as much, sometimes more money than they would do working?
Is it fair that people with jobs that require an education in many cases don't make more money than people with jobs that doesn't require education? 
It might be easier to get a job if you have an education but what is the point if someone else is making the same money on benefits?
A lot of people might think it's wrong to live on benefits but should it really be a question of morale if an unemployed person should try to get a job or just keep living on benefits?
Is this really the right way to fight unemployment and motivate people to educate themselves. I don't think so.
People in Sweden have a high living standard, and people without serious social problems such as abuse of drugs or alcohol will with or without a job live a rather decent life. At the same time Sweden is a country with huge debts and sometime these debts will have to be paid of. The system with unemployment benefits is costing a lot of money but I believe that the biggest problem with it is that it makes people very unwilling to educate themselves. 
My father has been in Asia recently and got in touch with a lot of people from that continent, especially people from Japan and China. He was very surprised by their knowledge and their very different attitude towards education. There young students actually wants to learn things. Students over there doesn't have the same possibilities to higher education as we in Sweden have but are much more eager to get educated. My father thinks that the Asians in a near future will take over as the leading ""raze"" and then the countries in Europe and North America will get much poorer. I don't really share his alarming view at the situation but there might be some truth in it. The mentality the Asians have is not shared by most of us Swedes. I must admit that my own reasons for studying is not only to get an education but to experience all that comes with it. 
People in Sweden don't have the pressure to get a job or an education as in many other countries. Here the government gives people the option not to work but live with the same standards anyway, and many do that. To care for the less fortunate is a good thing but I don't think that just handing out money is a good way of doing that. Some people would probably be in great danger to get problems with alcohol or drugs if they were just sitting around the house, and I don't think many would be in a rush to get a new job. To get them out working as soon as possible is a better solution. They should not do unpaid work in the public sector to earn their unemployment benefits but instead get paid for the work they do. There are a lot of holes to fill for example in schools and health care. The government could also support companies and motivate them to hire more people. If companies hired more people there would probably be a shortage of educated and skilled workers which would make the wages higher and probably motivate more people to get an education. Unemployment benefits could be handed out for just a few months giving a person a chance to get a job of his own choice and if he was unable to find one the government should provide a job for him. This would motivate people to go out and find jobs themselves.
To take away the unemployment benefits and instead support companies so that they can provide jobs in the private sector is a better way of dealing with unemployment. Hopefully this would also make people more willing to get an education.",0
17,0121.a2.txt,Sweden without a monarch would be like Hollywood without its film stars,"Some people are obviously against the tradition of having a monarch in Sweden and would prefer to abolish this, as I heard someone call it, ""expensive and old-fashioned institution"", but the question is not that simple. It is obvious that the monarch of Sweden's role has changed radically over the centuries, from being the supreme warlord in the battlefield and sovereign ruler to today's function as a not politically involved representative of the democratic country. What would Sweden look like without its monarch? Are its functions out of date? Is the royal institution simply an economical burden to society, a dinosaur of traditions that should be abandoned?

The Swedish monarchy of today carry many traditions and only a monarchy can preserve and make such traditions live, and if Sweden abolished its monarchy it would definitely be a culturally poorer and less colourful country. As most monarchies, Sweden has grown more democratic through the last few decades, with the consequence that the power of the monarch has decreased. But nevertheless, the monarch and his social sphere has been the centre of many important events and developments throughout history, and it is consequently not by coincidence that Swedish history books are mainly concentrated on the history of the country's kings and queens. The monarchs have simply been the ones to make and preserve history, and as the case is in today's society, to make history live by staying to traditions and show that we too make history at this very moment. The monarchy is the history and represent it.

On the other hand, some people argue that history is of minor importance when it comes to everyday life and that they would cope just as well ""without it"", but one must bear in mind that history is a common denominator that brings people together as a people and is an important part of national identity. Take for instance the day of independence in Norway, the seventeenth of May, which is celebrated throughout Norway and even by Norwegians abroad, and in which the royal family play a central role. In Sweden there are no festivals of that dimension, but there is an increasing interest in the national day of Sweden, the sixth of June, on which the royal family celebrates together with the Swedish people in Skansen in Stockholm and through the media. In addition to such festivals there are of course ceremonies which are made more impressive by the presence of a royalty. To be rewarded with a medal from the king's hand certainly beats receiving one from some politician; What would the Nobel Prize awards look like if G√∂ran Persson delivered the medals to the prominent price-winners?

The fact that the royal family's doings are of national interest and that the presence of its members is very honourable shows more of its importance to Swedish national identity. Of even greater importance are the Swedish royalties' doings and presence on certain occasions to the international identity and reputation of Sweden. For example, in the summer of 1998 I attended an opening ceremony of an international festival in Gotland where the queen of Sweden, Silvia, made the opening speech. The purpose of the festival was to establish and strengthen the trade market between the countries on the Baltic Sea. The queen was there as a representative for the Swedish Hanseatic Organisation, and of course, for Sweden. My experience from this occasion was that the foreign participants felt very honoured by the queen's attendance and that they felt that Sweden as a nation cared. Another example of this is that when the bosses of major Swedish companies represent Sweden and Swedish industry abroad (this applies especially to Asia and Africa, but to the rest of the world aswell) the company of the monarch definitely help the Swedish industry, and thereby Sweden to profit at length. 

In other words, to represent Sweden on non-political basis is by all means the most important task for today's monarch in Sweden, and I am in no doubt that the four Swedish Crowns that is paid per capita a year to maintain monarchy in Sweden is worth every √∂re. To abolish monarchy in Sweden would not pay since the tasks of the monarch would have to be replaced, presumably by politicians who could not possibly do the tasks with the effect of a monarch. To abolish monarchy in Sweden would be to bury some of the Swedish people's history and to abandon a vital part of Swedish identity. Sweden without a monarch would be like Hollywood without film stars.",0
18,0122.a2.txt,Swedish schools have an unjust grading system.,"Four years ago there was a reformation of how teachers were supposed to grade their pupils. The changes that were made were changes only for the worse, I think. Therefore I am going to argue against the current grading system of Sweden in this essay. I will bring up problems both in the grading process and the grading scale. The area of my essay will be restricted to Upper Secondary education since that is my most recent experience.

In Sweden today the pupil is completely at the mercy of their one teacher of each course when it comes to grading tests, most essays and the course itself. They are judged on a scale of four grades where the lowest one means that you have failed and equals zero. So in effect that is the same thing as no grade at all. The guidelines that the teachers have of how to grade are extremely vague and therefore can be interpreted in various ways. The criterias for receiving the highest mark is not defined at all. Lack of inspection, few grades of the scale, and vague or no grading guidelines: these are the three main issues that leads to an unfairness in our grading system. I will go in to these problems to explain them and their consequences further.

My main argent as to why the system of grading is unjust is the lack of inspection: Sweden is one of few countries where the teacher has no obligation to explain and justify the grading of a student to anyone except for the student himself/herself. This means that a teacher can set a subjective and unfair grade without anyone doing anything about it. I think that there always should be more than one person involved in setting grades, either an inspector or another teacher. The only way a student can make his or her voice herd is by complaining to the vice principal or principal of the school, but that is not very common since the teacher is an authority to the pupil whom they do not want to stand up to in that way. Recently though, it has become more and more common that the student starts to argue with the teacher when receiving a low grade. This creates a more pressured environment where the teachers sometimes gives in to setting a higher mark which the student really does not deserve so that students who do not argue to get a higher grade feel unfairly treated. 

One of the reasons of why this occurs is that there are too few marks to choose from. This is my second argument of why the grading system is unjust. There used to be the grades one to five where five is the highest one. Now the grades are; IG, G, VG and MVG, MVG being the highest one. IG equals zero, G ten points, VG fifteen points and MVG twenty points. Before, underachievers could at least get the grade one or two but now they get zero points. The IG pulls down the average more and gives the student less self-esteem and less motivation. Few grades also leads to large variations of the students achievements within the same grade. That means that pupils that have worked unequally hard and have quite big differences in test results get the same credit for their work.

Vague definitions of what is required in order to achive a mark is my third argument. The national guidelines given to the teachers are as I said very unspecific. This leads to different policies at different schools and differences between teachers' was of interpreting the guidelines. 

Your final grade is both the recite of your accomplished studies and the ticket in to further studies, and your future if you will. Therefore it is paramount that they are just and fair. The Swedish grading system can in no way affirm this.",0
19,0125.a2.txt,Why don't you have your parents living with you,"Why is it, that most of today's people do not live with their old-aged parents anymore? Do you not cherish the time you can spend with your parents? Do you really believe that the pension is well enough to support your parents living through the last days of their lifes and therefore no need to take care of them? Nowadays most old people are being sent away by their children, to live in nursery homes for elderly. For this argument, I will below bring up 3 major points I think is worth having in mind before you send your parents off.

My first point is health. By having elderly living with you, you can many times keep them mentally and physically active and healthy. Do make them feel useful and needed and keep them busy with some easy daily life chores, such as light cleaning, grocery shopping, execute bank errands but do not forget to keep an active social network. (Isnt it a great idea with a household of more headcounts to share those dreadful house chores?) On the other hand, by keeping old people in nursery homes, will many times, bring them to in-activity and boredom due to lack of physical and mental activities but also lack of outside contacts. They become passive and uninterested in what is going on around them. Brain cells have less to remember and therefore difficult to be kept in good shape and will deteriorate in a faster pace, which in the end result in people getting senile. 

Senility is a major problem in many western countries. Since senile persons are all very much depended on undevoted care and attention, they are being kept in already overcrowded and understaffed institutions until their death. I would say that this is actually a very tragic ending to life. Would you really want your parents to be one of them?

My second point is, that it is such a waste, not to have your parents living with you and your family. It is a great chance for your children to get close contacts with their grandparents and a great opportunity for them to learn to take care of and respect the elderly. Old people is also a great asset in terms of historical happenings and other invaluable life experience. There is so much to be learnt from them. Moreover, don't forget that by having your parents living with you, you also have a permanent full-time in-house childcare assistance.

The third and last point is about how you value the family ties between you and your parents. I believe most parents have gone through lots of difficulties but also happy times raising up you. Don't you think it is time for you to show your parents some gratitude and care for their old-aged well being. Do not feel that taking care of your parents is a burden or time consuming. Have perspective from another point of view, the positive view. Do understand, that many times old people are just being old, which neccessarily do not mean that they are incapable of taking care of themselves and that full-time devotion is needed. All you have to do is to give little time to care for and pay some attention to them. Love and compassion is not wasted since you many times, somehow will be re-paid. 

Have in mind that children often take after their own parents, not only the outer and inner features but also by their acts and doings. Just treat your parents they way you would like to be treated by your own children at old age.",0
20,0127.a2.txt,Humans need to stop eating anonymous meat and dying their petpoodles pink.,"Animals have always been important to mankind. In the beginning they served only as food on the table, but soon animals became useful in other aspects as well. Humans learned to keep animals close to themselves, cows were used for meat and their skin for gaining leather. Tamed dogs became important hunting partners and appreciated members of the family. 
Modern man also keeps pets in a large extent, even though problems with allergy more and more often prevents people from getting cats and dogs. For people who live alone or far from families a cat can be not only a kept animal but almost as good as a close friend. Some homes for the elderly have purchased cats as company for the people living there and even the most senile patients have responded positively to the animals. In some countries you can find special cemetaries for animals alone, where miniature stones mark the grave of a beloved pet. I also believe that it's good for children to be responsible for an animal and that they can learn a lot from it. 
Humans are, though at present times in a civilized way, nevertheless by nature meat-eaters and like the other animals we can't help what's in our nature. But there are different ways to find meat to eat. Our ancestors hunted animals and killed them on the spot, while we can transport meat in form of living creatures all over Europe just to butcher them where it costs less to get it done. Nowadays people don't realize what they are eating anymore when buying the neatly enclosed in plastic packages of meat in the stores. It would be good for us to get a face to the rumproast and with it some understanding about animals and how we ought to care for them. I firmly believe that we eat far to much meat per person and year anyway. The average American is said to have pounds of unprocessed meat inside himself. Today it is in many places possible to buy ecological food, even meat for those who want it. Ecological alternatives are available in a lot of articles and are produced in a environmentally friendly way by local farmers instead of the food that could have been transported halfway around the globe.
Some people claim that if we, instead of keeping large pieces of land for grazing cattle that are to become meat, used that same land for cultivating crops for direct human consumption could solve a lot of the problems of world starvation. I'm not sure how true this is, but if it's even a little truth in it, we should consider in just how high esteem we hold our hamburgers. 
If something should separate us from the other animals it is claimed to be our bigger brains and our ability to feel compassion with others. Sadly, we do not demonstrate this in our relationship towards animals. When we humans lived in the outdoors as well we treasured the animals and depended largely upon them while we nowadays just see them as anonymous foodstuffs we bring home in neat boxes from ICA. We use animals for experimenting in getting ourselves shampoo that doesn't sting in our eyes or in acchieving the perfect mascara. Experiments on animals such as cats and dogs are being done all the time, which can occasionally upset the public. It's always worse when it's cute animals and not nasty rats. Heavens forbid someone took the cat from someones family and shaved his fur off and put hairdying liquid on him! Mankinds'relationship to animals is in many ways more complicated now than it has ever been before.",0
21,0128.a2.txt,Long live the monarchy in Sweden!,"The intensity of the debate about whether Sweden should continue to be a monarchy or not has had its highs and lows. Today, the debate has somewhat declined and even the most eager monarchy opponents seem to admit that the battle is lost, at least for the time being. The Swedish Social Democrats have now and then spoken out against Sweden being a monarchy and declared how they want the county to become a republic instead. They have an internal problem though, since the majority of their own members are in favour of a monarchy as the form of government in Sweden. Of course this may have something to do with the fact that we have a very popular royal family at the moment. But there are several aspects of the matter and I will deal with the most common arguments used by the monarchy opponents. My intention is to argue why Sweden should continue to be a monarchy.

The most frequent argument against the monarchy is the fact that it is not democratic. A monarch is born into the profession and can not be elected by the people. The people can not choose the person they want to be their foremost representative officially. The Prime Minister is elected by the people and that is why he also should be the head of State and act as a President, they argue. One problem a Prime Minister would have to face though, if he were to be the head of State as well, is the fact that he might not be very welcome in some countries. A Prime Minister is foremost a political person that represents specific political and social values that could be offensive in some cultures. He would also get two full time jobs on his hands and the Prime Minister part of the job seems to be quite enough for one person to handle. A monarch, on the other hand, is a non-political person that remains as head of State during fluctuations of political parties in power. The monarch must be born into the profession, I believe, otherwise the issue of political voting would be inevitable. Another good thing about the law of succession is the fact that in Sweden, like in many other kingdoms, the monarch is trained from birth to act as the head of State. In fact the monarch is under constant education during his entire life. He learns about his country and keeps himself up to date by visiting schools, hospitals and important industries for example. All of this is done in order to represent Sweden in the best possible way and to make important business contacts abroad. The King is often called a door opener for industrial leaders to meet with colleges from foreign countries. This task is a very important one and Sweden has gained a lot from the King's door opening trips abroad.

However, the monarch is often seen as a too aristocratic, snobby, rich diva that does not know a thing about ordinary way of life, at least the critics think so. They argue that we do not need a national role model that costs a lot of money. Some people also seem to think that the only thing the royal family does when representing is to arrange and attend parties. To tell the truth they actually do arrange and attend quite a lot of parties or representation dinners, but that is a part of their job. In terms of working-hours there are few persons in this country that have as many as they do. They are theoretically on duty around the clock, every day of their lives. People that regard the royal family as too snobby and aristocratic probably refer to the fact that whenever you see them they are dressed very properly and elegantly. The King must have a certain commanding presence though, and therefore dress and appear properly, to achieve what is expected of him. As for the issue of the costs of having a King, Queen and court, it only costs each Swedish citizen 4,50 Swedish crowns per year. The royal castles are not included in this budget, but they would be kept and looked after for historical reasons anyway. 

Sweden has a long tradition of being a monarchy and the royal family's work has been well appreciated by the majority of the Swedish citizens for several generations. However, I believe that the issues discussed above shows that our monarchy should be maintained not just for historical reasons, but for the fact that Sweden benefits from the work done by the monarch. We like our King and we need him.",0
22,0130.a2.txt,The Preservation of Wolves - a critical issue,"Long before man set foot in Scandinavia, packs of wolves roamed the peninsula which today form the countries of Sweden and Norway. Then, following the retreating mass of ice, the first humans entered the wild country from the south and conflict arose between the two species. Both being predatory and hunting the same game, wolf and man long lived as bitter enemies and there were casualties on both sides. Soon, however, man gained the upper hand due to her dexterity and ingenuity. She crafted weapons with which the wolves could not compete and before long the packs found it safest to stay out of her way, as she, as is the nature of her species, continued to colonise the land. 
The situation has changed greatly since that first encounter between humans and wolves in Scandinavia. Humans have, indeed, colonised the peninsula - and, in fact, the world - and pushed the diminished packs back to the verge of extinction. This atrocity was justified by the ""danger"" that the large packs presented to humans and their livestock, as is depicted in many a fairy tale (for instance the story of Little Red Ridinghood). Still in these ""enlightened"" times, wolves are considered dangerous and some voices cry out for their extermination. This essay is a cry for their preservation.

The main argument one hears against the wolves, comes from the Saami community up in the north. They complain about wolves eating their reindeer - which is still their main source of income - and other livestock. Of course I have sympathy with them for their economic losses, but one must bear in mind that wolves fed on reindeer long before humans and that they, in their diminished packs, often are too few to go after big game such as elks. I do not think that we because of this should consider wolves as vermin, to be killed off for the sake of our convenience. The wolves in the Sweden-Norway peninsula are the last remnants of a once large population. We are not the ones to decide whether they should live on as a species or go extinct merely because of our so-called superiority. Our own interests as inhabitants of Earth and representatives of life actually demands the opposite: that we should help our furry companions to live on and prosper. Because, as has been stated by such renowned biologists as Richard Dawkins and Steven J. Gould, a multitude of species increases the chances of some of them surviving a possible (and rather likely) future catastrophe and those species would then carry with them the seeds of future life on this planet. Where would we have been if the dinosaurs would have exterminated the little furry rodent that was lurking in the bushes? That little mammal survived the natural disaster that killed off the mighty dinosaurs and went forth to multiply and evolve until, finally, we came along; the descendants of ""vermin"", if you will.
A person vaguely familiar with evolutionary biology could here remark that it is only natural that some species go extinct, that it is part of the natural selection process so bravely proclaimed by Darwin. This is true and I will not argue with that statement. It is, however, not natural that this selection takes place at a rate of fifty to one hundred going extinct every day. Most of them are insects and had yet to be discovered, but that does not lessen the tragedy of their death.

Another argument with which I have been faced, was that since man is clearly superior to the wolf in intelligence (I have arguments against that statement alone, but I will leave them out in this essay), why should we not kill them? What is the use of having them around?
Apart from the reasons I have already stated above, I have yet another to ad. Compassion. We should let them live out of compassion for them as a fellow species. Since one keeps hearing the preposterous nonsense about humans ""being set apart from the animals"", it seems we pride ourselves on our intelligence and complex emotions, since, basically, that is all that really sets us apart from other animals. With this in mind the first argument I stated, that the animal life on Earth should be preserved in the interest of the continuance of life, should appeal to our intelligence and the second, to feel compassion rather than hatred, should certainly appeal both to our emotions and sense of moral. The Saami community should receive financial compensation to help them cope with the loss of the reindeer, a loss that really is not too great, although I am sure it is keenly felt. This compensation could be provided either by the government or a fund especially designated for this purpose. It is in our power to let them live, therefor I think we should.",0
23,0131.a2.txt,ALLOW BASEBALL CAPS IN THE CLASSROOM,"There is a lively debate going on in Swedish schools whether to allow pupils to wear caps or whether to force them to take them off in class. The custom to wear a baseball cap has become very popular and many pupils do not take the cap off their heads when they enter the classroom. What young people wear has always been discussed by adults and teachers have even in the past reacted to how their students are dressed. Nevertheless, the discussion about the cap is much more upset than previous discussions. In some schools the debate is so intense that it has divided the school staff into two groups depending on the opinion on the matter.
This is a rather complex issue and I will take up just two standpoints for allowing pupils to wear baseball caps in the classroom. First, clothing is a part of a young person's struggle for identity, second, the cap itself is not the problem, there are other reasons why teachers get so upset when pupils do not take off their caps. 
In the first place, young people try several ways to find out and show who they are or would like to be. For instance, music and sports are often important parts of their lives which they, naturally, have a need to express in different ways. In other words, a cap, often with a logotype showing what music style or sports team the wearer likes, is a way to show identity. It is no news that teenagers want to dress differently from adults. Not too long ago this could be done by wearing jeans and a sweater. This is not longer possible because it is the way any teachers dress nowadays. 
Strangely enough, the reaction to and the feelings about pupils wearing baseball caps in class seem more upset than, for example, the reactions to punk-rockers in the 1980s. One explanation of this is that the cap is a religious and social symbol. Traditionally, men take off their caps in church in order to show respect and generations of simple men have gone ""cap in hand"" to beg for their survival. Undoubtedly, this humility is what many teachers seem to want from their students in the 1990s. They feel provoked and not respectfully treated by pupils who wear caps in class. Of course, both teachers and pupils shall be met by respect in school. However, it is lack of respect to demand this humility from teenagers. School has to look upon every single pupil as an individual and to let this individual develop in her/his way. People who do not want the pupils to wear caps in class might ask where this is going to end, what are young persons wearing in2050, are things getting worse and worse? I would say that this is not the problem and it brings me to the next argument for allowing caps in the classroom.
The reason why teachers get upset when pupils do not take off the cap is unclear. It may be argued that it is rude and impolite or that the pupil's eyes can not be seen. Still, the baseball cap has just become a symbol for more serious problems. It is mainly boys in caps that cause the teachers' irritation. Even this has its explanation in religious traditions, thus, men traditionally take off the caps while women keep their hats on in order to show respect in church. Owing to this, girls in baseball caps appear less provocative than boys. Furthermore, boys behave, in general, more provocatively than girls. It is not to be said that teachers are careless about the real problems. However, some teachers are more likely to deal with the cap-problem than to search the origin to why things do not work out well in the classroom.
In conclusion, the baseball cap has become a bigger issue than it deserves. To wear a cap is, in most cases, a rather harmless way for young persons to show who they are. When teachers choose to focus their attention on whether pupils take off their caps or not, they are neglecting more serious problems. Eventually, in order to deal with the pupils of today teachers have to get rid of old traditions and face modern society.",0
24,0133.a2.txt,"A NEW, BIG, SHINY AND POWERFUL CAR IS BETTER","A new, big, shiny and powerful car is better. That is the statement I will put forward in this essay. I will explain the importance of these qualities in a car and why the vehicle needs them. There are a number of things to be concerned about when it comes to personal transportation, easy access, safety, environment, to name a few. There are also different aspects of these concerns, and I will argue that all are meet in the most satisfactorily way in a new, big, shiny and powerful car. So, to start with one of the concerns I mentioned above, the importance or benefit from easy access.
Easy access is one of the major advantages by owning your own means of transportation. For instance, very few people live close enough to walk to their work. Public transportation in any form requires that you have to get to your local bus stop or train station. There is a time-table that will tell when transportation is possible, and if these set times doesn't suit me there is nothing I can do. By owning a car I can make my own time-table. I will never have to walk to a distant bus stop in the rain or in the cold, and for obvious reasons I cannot be late for the car as I always will risk being with the bus. My car will be there in the parking lot or in the garage, waiting to take me to work. Everybody is late sometimes, valuable minutes may be lost and this can very fast create a stressful situation. If I have a car powerful enough I will always be able to catch up on those few minutes lost, perhaps in the morning, minutes that probably would cause a disaster if I depended on public transportation. I would be late and end up with a very bad start of the day. The need for a powerful car in the case of making up lost time is essential, and a strong engine can make such a situation less dangeorus, but this concerns the area of safety which I will now turn to.
When it comes to cars, safety is always an important issue. If, one morning I have to speed up a little bit because I am late, there is always the possibility that I may have to overtake another car. The basic rule here is that a powerful engine will make the overtaking of another car safer. It is as simple as that. Every extra horsepower is needed to pass the other car as fast and as smooth as possible. Being on the wrong side of the road is a danger to you and anyone on the road, and every second there that may be avoided by a stronger engine is an increase in safety.
Size doesn't matter, it is said. True or not, it is a big lie in car safety. Any investigation on the subject will say that a big car is safer than a small car. In the unfortunate event of an accident the metal around me will function as protection and reduce the impact. A big car will have larger impact areas to take up the force in an accident, and this will greatly reduce the possibility of the driver ending up with the car engine in his lap. I have here talked about safety on the personal level, but safety can also be seen in a much wider perspective, the safety of the environment around us. This I will turn to in the next paragraph.
A new car, built in the last few years is more environmental friendly than an older car. The car industry is constantly improving their cars, and every day progress is being made. A car today cannot be sold without a catalytic converter. There are laws prohibiting that, but an older car doesn't need this device to clean the exhaustion air, and installing one in an old car is costly and complicated. 
The recycling business is growing, more and more things can be recycled and used again. Several of the companies making cars today are building them with the paradoxical intention of making the car easier to take apart. Materials are chosen because they can be recycled. As with the catalytic converter this goes for newer vehicles, older cars made before this was a concern to the industry were not built with this environmental possibility in mind and thus are not as environmental friendly as a new car. Progress has been done concerning air pollution and how to take care of the car after it has done its job.
These are just a few arguments stating why a car should be new, big and powerful. I said in the beginning of this essay that the car also had to be shiny, apart from these other qualities which I have talked of above. This quality is almost self-evident to me. Of course a car should be taken care of. In our society the car tells a lot about the owner, what kind of car it is?, how is it cared for?, what colour it is?, and so on. Combined, these questions with some of what I have said above might say very much about the owner and might give him respect and admiration from others. A car is a car but it is also so much more.",0
25,0134.a2.txt,Monarchy - obsolete in a democratic society,"Today in Sweden the monarchy and its representatives, the royal family, are enjoying great popularity. But is there actually a place for such an institution in a modern, democratic society? I would say that there isn't, and below I shall seek to explain why this is so.
A monarch is, by definition, someone who has inherited his or her occupation as the head of state of a country. This of course has not only purely professional implications; it also brings with it a certain status and a position as a national figurehead. Even a monarch without any actual power or political influence holds an important position as a representative of his country. It is therefore quite remarkable that someone is to be born into this function; in a democracy of today a job such as this should not be the private possession of a specific family and because of this the monarchy is in itself undemocratic.
As this is obviously a matter of principle, it might be argued that such concerns are of little practical importance when it comes to a merely ceremonial regent such as the king of Sweden. On the other hand, when regarding it from the monarchs point of view, it is indeed very much a practicality; his personal freedom and his ability to choose his life is actually greatly limited from the very moment of his birth. He has the theoretical possibility, of course, to abdicate, but since this is not a very common event it does hardly present a realistic alternative. Such a restriction of individual liberty is not usually associated with a modern democracy.
But, some might object, having a figurehead such as Sweden's ceremonial monarch is indeed important; our king is our countries main representative abroad, a national symbol. This is true in as much as having a representative person on an international level could well be said to be important. But because this actually is important, it is only natural to assume that we would want to choose for ourselves who is to represent us. A monarch, who has only inherited his representative duties, is obviously not necessarily the most suitable person for this office. An elected head of state, a president, could on the other hand to a greater extent than a monarch be said to actually represent the people. The duties of this elected head of state might still be mainly ceremonial; the president wouldn't even have to be a political figure and there doesn't have to be any danger of too much power being concentrated in one person, as some might indeed fear.
Are there no advantages of having a monarch, rather than ceremonial president, then? Well, some people would perhaps argue that the institution of the monarchy and the circumstances surrounding it has a value in itself, that it adds a touch of glamour to the country and that reading articles in weekly magazines about the extraordinary lives of the royal family adds an indispensable joy to the dreary lives of the so called ordinary people. However, we may very well ask ourselves if such an attitude actually belongs in a modern society, and to this I must answer that it doesn't. The media hype surrounding the monarchy in general and the royal family in particular is horrifyingly reminiscent of times long since past, when humble respect towards the regent was demanded of the lower classes. The king of today is nothing but a curiosity, but is still sometimes surrounded by the attention bestowed upon his more despotic predecessors. This sort of public indulgence in the worship of royalty might be considered comparatively harmless, but does nevertheless preserve an image of a social structure that is no longer relevant. 
One might of course also consider this matter from the point of view of the monarch and his family; constant exposure to the public eye gazing through the distorting lens of the tabloid press is an attention that they have little choice but to accept.
All together, this shows that a monarchy could not be said to belong in a modern democracy; not only is it undemocratic in itself, it is also unsuitable for the functions it is supposed to perform and severely out of date, perpetuating an old class system. An elected ceremonial head of state would clearly answer better to the demands of our time.",0
26,0135.a2.txt,Racism,"""Like tribalism, fundamentalism, homophobia and all the other shallow responses of one person to another, racism concentrates on ""what"" you are, and ignores ""who"" you are.""
Timothy Findley
This is an argumentational essay against racism. Racism has been a problem ever since the humans began to walk on the earth. Racism means that you as a racist are looking down on people of other races, and treat them unfairly. You see your own race as the best one. In our history, the focal point of racism has laid on the whites discrimination of the other races. That is partly because they have had the power most of the time. Very many problems had occurred based on misunderstandings about other races cultures and the believes that in a race all the people have the same physical characteristics depending of which race they come from. In this essay I will try to argue why I am against racism based mostly on the two aspects, unfair treatment of certain races an the belief that some races are better than the other.

The United Nations resolution about every peoples equal rights, that we here in Sweden are bound to follow, says that we can't treat other races different from our own. Unfortunately, even if we have a non-discrimination law from 1994 here in Sweden, this is not followed. A immigrant who have the same criteria as a white person is in many cases chosen last when he/she is looking for a job. This happens even if they speak very good Swedish. They don't get the job because of their appearance and colour of their skin. In Sweden fortunately we don't usually have open struggle between races. In Sweden there are a lot of scepticism against other cultures than the Swedish but there are only a few groups who tries to hurt people. In other countries though, like South Africa was when the Apartheid system was the ruling system, the hole government and authorities tries to discriminate the black people in all different sorts of ways. The blacks had no right to vote, they were segregated and tortured and they were not allowed to get any good job. The whites were afraid that if the black people got the power the whites would do the same to them as revenge. As we see in South Africa today when the Apartheid system no longer exist more black and whites are now living together and the country are now up on its feet again after decades of racism were the whites thought they were the master race.

This leads us in to the other aspect I thought to write about namely the belief in master races, races that are better than other races. Frustration about social situation is one reason why this thought have occurred. You have to blame someone that look different and comes from an other culture and meaning that your race is better than his/hers. The best example of this is of course what happened in Nazi-Germany during the 30s and 40s when millions of people were murded because of the thought that the Jews an other races were ""untermenschen"" which means that they weren't worth as much as the Germanic master race. Yale biologist Johnatan Morks writes in an article about that he don't belief that races are distinct biological categories created by differences in genes inherit from parents. This shows that the racist are wrong about a master race, there are very few genetical differences between races. There is no evidence that some races could have hereditary intelligent or mental rudiments or being stronger than other races just because he is from just this race. It is of course never proven that everyone of a certain race have the same hereditary draws. The best athletes and professionals are from all different races. 

As you could see we are very much alike. I think we can learn a lot from other cultures and that we must deal with all the environmental problems we are standing before in the future together. Even the food could be a problem in the future where we should cooperate and not kill each other because we look different. Money and power used by some races to discriminate others are also a problem that we should solve in the future. I don't think that people are so different after all, we all have two ears, one nose, one mouth and are born by a mother. So beating other people and thinking that their race incorrectly are better than another, is only racist rubbish we all have to fight against through knowledge and communication.",0
27,0136.a2.txt,Our Elderly Deserve Qualified Care,"The ""elderly"" I will be referring to in this essay, are old people that are no longer able to look after themselves. They can no longer live by themselves and the question is, whether the state or the family should look after them. 
Since I have been working with elderly at a nursing home for four years, I have some personal experience of the accommodation, treatment and care that they need. 
In this essay I have chosen to argue against families looking after the elderly. My argumentation is based on three main arguments.
The first argument has to do with safety. How many families today can honestly say, that they can provide proper accommodations for an elderly parent for an unlimited time-period? It has not only to do with having the space needed, but also that the house or apartment should be adequately equipped to accommodate an elderly citizen that is unable to take care of himself. 
A nursing home, on the other hand, is functional and suitable for appropriate care and treatment. The beds have protection on the sides to prevent accidents, there are lifts in the ceiling to make sure a disabled person will get to his chair safely and the bathrooms are equipped to make regular baths possible. It may sound inhuman to use these kind of facilities, but a lot of elderly people staying at home are confined to their beds all day and wont get a proper shower more than a few times a year. That is even more inhuman. 
My second argument has to do with medical service. In a private home, someone has to take responsibility for the medication and also make sure that the person is looked after during the day. There will also be a need for some sort of alarm-system in case of an emergency during times when he or she is left alone. Today, most families need two incomes to support a family. Having an elderly relative living in the family would put a further strain on the economy, since one person would have to stay at home or work part-time. 
At a nursing home, the elderly have a close contact with doctors and nurses all around the clock. There are also nursing assistants, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. They will be able to meet the different needs an elderly person might have.
My third argument has to do with social contact. It is important for everyone to have friends and acquaintances. One of the biggest fears of getting old is loneliness. For the first time in our lives we have all the time we need but no one to share it with. The children are in the middle of life, bringing up their children, working on their careers and they don't have time for daily visits. Elderly people, who can not as easily visit their friends, are at a risk of being isolated and lonely.
At a nursing home, they are surrounded by people and have lots of opportunities to make new friends. They meet other elderly as well as the staff. There are a lot of activities; like occupational therapy, newspaper-readings, entertainment and church-services, that they can attend. 
We should not fool ourselves to believe that the stressed-out people of the nineties have the time, money, competence or even the will to take on the responsibility of taking care of the elderly people. I'm also sure that the elderly would not want to be in a situation where they are totally dependent on their children. They don't want to feel that they are a burden to their lives. They need their privacy, even when they are getting older and in need of assistance.
Today there are a variety of service buildings, nursing homes and old peoples homes located where people live, so that anyone who wants to can stay living in their own area. 
When families are relieved from the responsibility of the everyday care of the elderly, they can put their energy and efforts on visiting them on a regular basis. They can bring them home for visits and take an active part in their lives, but they should leave the daily physical and medical care to the professionals, without feeling guilty about it.",0
28,0137.a2.txt,Euthanasia - A Human Right,"The word ""euthanasia"" stir up many feelings inside of us. It originates in the Greek language and means ""good death"". As soon as death is brought up for discussion we tend to defensively distance ourselves; it is very unpleasant to talk about it. But I think it is important that we do discuss it, since we all have very different thoughts and conceptions about death and how we want to face it when it's our turn. One aspect to discuss is whether or not we should allow assistance to people who want to committ suicide, but are incapable in one way or another to do so.
Today, euthanasia is only allowed for people living in Columbia, Japan, the Netherlands and the state of Oregon (in the U.S.A.). I think this is strange since more than these four states have ratified the UN Decleration of Human Rights, which states in its third article that all individuals have the right to life. And, as I see it, death is the end of life, in other words, dying is the last thing we do in life, and thus the right to life indirectly grants us a right to end our life whenever we want to. This point of view is supported by most countries, who in fact do not regard suicide as a legal crime. As a matter of fact, it would be quite absurd to have a legal procedure against a person who is accused of killing herself. 
Everyday we choose between continue living our lives or not to continue living and instead end our suffering by committing suicide. By doing so we have not broken any judicial law. But if we happen to end up in a hospital bed, unable to perform even the simplest of movements and even less take our lives, the law will have to be broken by others in order to execute our uttermost privilege as human beings. I say it is a privilege, because I think that when a person is in such pain, or feels that living is so indignant in her state that she rather dies than tries to continue her fight to live, then it most certainly must be a privilege to have the right to end it once and for all. 
There's really no right or wrong side of this discussion. But what I think the opponents of euthanasia disregards far too often, and show little sympathy for, is the wish and rights of the suffering patient. They tend to restrict their arguing to a discussion of old-fashioned morals and preachings. And since they are a majority, and the laws forbidding euthanasia are in their favor, they thus impose power over the human rigths granted in the third article as mentioned above, in a way they would not be able to if the patients were capable of committing suicide on their own. The patients are deprived of their rights to decide over their own lives. Therefore I think euthanasia should be judicially on a level with suicide. 
This is not an easy issue to take a stand on, or even discuss, since there are so many different opinions and emotions surrounding it. Of course, this issue is extremely full of emotion to those who have a family member or close relative in a situation where her fate lies in the machine which keeps her breathing and regularly nourishes her, or whose pain wont't leave until she is so full of drugs that she is more dead than alive. Because of the pain a situation like this causes the patient's family, every effort should be made in order to persuade the patient to reconsider her decision. And the routines and procedures should be well developped, as well as the matters of responsibility and who should ""turn off the switch"". These are of course very difficult questions to which there are no solutions yet.
What I have tried to illustrate is the importance of our unrestricted right to life and, indirectly, right to death. And I have questioned why we have the right to committ suicide when we are ""healthy"", and deprived of that same right when we happen to be ""disabled"". Once again I would like to stress the importance of discussing this matter with those we have closely around ourselves and who might be concerned when it is time; it will certainly make things a little easier if we know and respect each others' stands when reality hits us the hard way.",0
29,0138.a2.txt,The state doesn't support families to take care of they're elderly.,"Nowadays it is almost seen as a failure to let the state take care of you're elderly. On the other hand today's society doesn't support families to take care of them. I'm taking stand in this subject according to Swedish circumstances. In other countries conditions might be different and people are given other possibilities. Looking at the society we live in today, and judging from my own experience, while I've been in contact with this quite recently, I think it is not possible for the family to take care of the elderly. My arguments against it is simply time and money.

When it comes to the economical aspect, the state doesn't support the family to take care of they're elderly. This I will state with an example from my own experience. My grandmother was in need of extra help. Because of the distances up in the north where she is living it wasn't possible to get someone to come to her house and help her as much as she needed. They told us the only solution was to put her in a service flat in town. Non of us relatives agreed with this. My mum's youngest sister who doesn't have a family decided to take leave from her job and move in with my grandmother. This turned out to be a fulltime job, but with no salary. To look after you're old sick mother is not seen at as a job so she didn't get ATP for this full time job, and only three hours pay a day from the state. The whole situation was intolerable, even though all the relatives put in some money to help out. 

To have one more person in the household does not just mean extra expanses in food. To get an extra person who is in the need of care also means that you got to have a room to spare, you might have to rearrange or even rebuild some parts of your home and maybe get special facilities to be able to take care of this person. All this costs money. To care for them properly you also have to work less, which means less money. When the situation asks for the opposite. 

The time aspect isn't of less importance. Nowadays families hardly have time to do things together themselves. Everybody in the family have different schedules. You are lucky if the whole family is gathered around the dinner table once a day. Many families have to leave they're children to different day centres, nannies, and even hire someone to drive them to and from different activities to get the schedule to work out, I dept that those families really have time for an extra very demanding person.
To take care of an old person will take a lot of time and effort. You will have to cut down on work. It is not for no reason they need to be taken care of. They wont be healthy and happy just by living in your home if no one is ever there. If they feel as a burden and that no one has time for them they will be better of in a service flat.

If you don't have the economical possibilities and the extra time to set aside for a person who needs you full time. I think you have to face the facts. They will be better taken care of by the state. This picture of the family taking care of they're elderly doesn't go hand in hand with today's society. It is not a failure to let the state take care of you're elderly. After all, both family and state have the same interest, to give the elderly the best possible care. This is just the way the system works and instead of being ashamed of that you don't have the possibilities to take care of them in your own home, make sure to use just a small part of that time and money it would cost you to have them in you're home, and visit them more often.",0
30,0139.a2.txt,Homosexuals should be allowed to adopt children,"Young people and women are more acceptant towards homosexual couples adopting children than elderly and men. I am a young woman and I strongly believe that gay couples are capable of raising children just as well as good heterosexual parents, some even better. It's not a matter of sexual preference, it's more important to look at the person's personality and capability of taking care of a child. In surveys that have been done, they found that the attitude and the answers to questions about homosexuals adopting children were different depending on people's age and sex. This is a delicate subject with no strict rule or answer to what is best for the child.

I am embarrassed of being part of today's prejudiced society that has to look down on others to make them feel well. That's what they did hundred years ago when they used black people as slaves, when they forced Indians to leave their lands, and not so long ago when Nazis terrorised and persecuted Jews. And when it comes to women's right in society, they didn't even have the right to vote until some decades ago in some countries. 
We have begun to see it as a matter of course to let everyone have their say, to respect everyone no matter what their colour or religion they have. That brings me to my first point, why should we treat homosexuals in a different way than we do with others, just because they have another sexual preference than the majority of people? No one deserves to be treated as an abnormal person, we must see to the individual when we make ourselves an opinion about someone. 
I firmly believe that homosexuals can be just as good parents as anyone else. There are too many children born to this world who are treated badly by their biological or adoptive parents. Not everyone who has got children is suitable for it, and as someone has said, there should be a license for being a parent. Children may be victims of abuse; drug addicted parents, violence and many other reasons for us to look at parents as individuals instead of terms of homo- or heterosexuals.
Until 1944 it was in Sweden prohibited for persons to have sexual intercourse with someone of the same sex. Now that we look back at it, the law seems narrow-minded, unfair and ridiculous. So what will the people of the next century think of us people of today when they read about how we treat homosexual persons? Homosexuals will be much more accepted and represented in the future, and I think children will be a natural component in a homosexual family. It's just a very slow process.
Many people believe that children with homosexual parents can have a tough time growing up with all the prejudices from the surroundings, that the children will be bullied and not have the same upbringing as children with heterosexual parents. But there are as many ways of bringing up a child, as there are parents! And we all know that people can get bullied for no reason at all, and it usually hasn't got anything to do with the parents.
I have a very good friend; she's a lesbian. I know she would like to have children very much, and I feel sad when I realise that she probably will never get the chance to be the superb Mother she could be. It's all about personality and circumstances when you consider a person being a good parent or not.

I hope people will get a clearer and more open-minded way of looking at homosexuals and children. We need to see through the surface and stop judging people; we need to give the homosexuals a chance to prove they are just as good parents as anyone else. 
With trust in the common sense, I believe that people's opinions will change in the future, to the better.",0
31,0140.a2.txt,High schools in Sweden need discipline!,"The aim of this essay is to point out the lack of discipline in Swedish high schools; especially when it comes to being on time. In Sweden, people have a tendency to think that we have the best school system in the world. I do agree that we have reached a high level of academic standards, but what about the rest? All through the 90s a wind of student democracy has blown through Swedish high schools, and all rules are gone. Students fight for their rights in school, however, they forget that they have responsibilities just like everybody ells. High school students want to be treated like the young adults that they are, and in my opinion this desire is well met by the staff. The question is do they behave like adults? In many ways, yes, but there are also many areas, which are open for a great deal of improvement. In my opinion, Swedish high school students have been given more freedom than many of them can handle. The problem is that most of them are not even aware of it; they take everything for granted since Sweden is a liberal and free country. Being on time is, to me, a very simple issue. Students who are eighteen years old ought to know the importance of being on time. What really upsets me, is the fact that many high school students, indeed, do not realize how important this is. Going to school is a job, and people who do not arrive at work on time find themselves in trouble. However, this rule does not apply in Swedish high schools. In elementary schools it is different; there it is not acceptable to be late. Swedish students in secondary education do not realize how free and well treated they are. Perhaps some education in other countries' school systems would help them to understand and appreciate what they have.

I can only compare to the school system in America, which I had the opportunity to experience during a high school year. In America, the situation is totally different. American high schools have often been criticized and analyzed; especially when it comes to the academics. In my opinion, we should think twice before we criticize America; at least they have some respect and discipline in their schools. An American high school student is not allowed to leave the classroom without a signed pass from the teacher, and there is staff in the hallways to make sure that there are no students running around without passes. Neither are students allowed to leave campus during school hours, and the school hours are fixed; there is no such thing as a free period. Students are also subject to a dress code (whereas students in Sweden can attend school half-naked). If a student repeatedly comes in late, he or she will, without hesitation, get detention. American teachers do not tolerate disrespectful behavior and they are not to be called by their first name.

Let us now take a look at Sweden. What happens when students are late for class? Nothing. In Sweden, students can literally do anything they want to, and nobody cares. Some students drop in five minutes late, and others arrive when there are fifteen minutes left of the class. To me, this is very disturbing and disrespectful. Of course everybody can be late once or twice, but not every day. A person who is frequently late does not give a reliable impression. Somehow this has to stop. The 90s are almost over and now it is time for other winds to blow. Swedish high schools have to obtain some disciplinary rules. The school is not doing its students a favor by letting them get away with it. Many students are caught in a bad pattern and they do not see any reasons to change since it seems to be accepted to arrive at any time. I wonder what will happen when reality strikes. I honestly thought that it would be different at the university, but I was wrong. Some people were even twenty minutes late for the important roll call on the first day of school. And really, why would things be different?
This is what students in Sweden are used to. I do know that the world outside school does not accept that people are late. The train, for example, will not wait for lazy students. Something has to be done, or my generation will delay the entire country of Sweden. I do not mean that teachers have to act like policemen; high schools and universities are not play schools. We are talking about adults and the attitude among students has to change.

Abroad Swedes are known to be on time. It is alarming that many young adults have no respect for the importance of being on time. In Sweden everything has to be done kindly and pedagogically, which of course is good, but everything has a limit. High school students are young, but yet they are adults and it is time to stop all the coddling with them. Let them taste life. In life we all have to take the consequences of being late!",0
32,0142.a2.txt,Do our living standards require that the state looks after the elderly people?,"This essay is mainly going to discuss whether we can take care of elderly people at home or if the best solution is to keep them in institutions. Firstly, the main reason of keeping grandparents in institutions is that our family attitudes have changed because of our different way of living, compared to the old society. Have we forgotten the social aspect with close family relations including taking care of our parents when they become old. Is this the fact because of lack of moral responsibility or is it a financial problem? These are questions hard to answer but still there are problems that can be solved by financial aid to elderly care and change in attitudes. Maybe the best way for caring about many elderly people is to put them into institutions. This subject will be discussed with the mentioned questions as topics. If this will not help you to see which is the best way to take care of grandparents, this can anyway give you suggestions of what could be done about it. 

If we compare our attitude today towards elderly care with how it was in the fifties we notice that the attitude towards old people have changed. A question can be asked whether we care less or not about elderly people today when the individual person is more stressed by all the choices and demands in the society. This lead to a generation gap which is a huge expanse between parent, child and the grandparents. It is said that young people and adults do not know each other. They live under the same roof, but they rarely see one another because at least one of the parents go to work before the children are awake. In this kind of family where a generation gap exists, it can sometimes be good to have a grandmother at home, giving the children some of the attention the parents do not give. On the other hand, if the grandparents are too sick and can not manage without a lot of care it can make the relations worse for this type of family.

How we treat our old grandparents and children can be related to how we define life quality and good relations. Life quality today is usually having a good employment, friends, family and be rich enough to buy all the capital goods that an average income earner is expected to use. If the aim is to consume then we generally do have a high living standard but what about family values? The society has developed the humans to be more individualistic and self-centered. We have forgotten which happiness close relations in a big family can produce. We want to live with our nuclear family or spend time with our step-children or step-father. With the mentioned family-development there is no room for taking care of elderly grandparents, specially if they are sick. The moral responsibility for the family and parents that we used to have in the fifties, is history today in the Western European countries. 

The problem of not having the possibility to keep elderly people at home today is more of a financial problem than a question of responsibility. Living on one salary can be hard for bigger families if for example three children go to school and the family expenses are high. Then there are no financial means to spare for taking care of a grandmother. Institutions are good from an financial point of view, because today it costs often too much to be at home from work or keeping nurses at home to take care of your older parents. However, high-income earners should not have a problem with financing their elderly care. As long as they spend a lot of time at work they do not have the energy to take care of their grandparents. 

Now, as we know these problems for taking care of elderly people at home it makes even more complicated to find solutions to them. We can not go back to the fifties and think that we can handle the elderly care like the farmers did. The home care of elderly in old days also had disadvantages like poverty, even though it often was more social for the grandparents. It is difficult to change peoples attitudes. One thing that could be done for both families with middle and high incomes is building blocks of service flats for elderly in the families neighbourhood which could improve the social relations with grandparents. This would give the children and parents the possibility to visit them more often and also notice if there is something wrong with the service quality, so they could do something about it. The grandparents would also enjoy not to live to far from their children. 

An answer to if we do not have any moral responsibility over our grandparents can be that we are used to live our life on our own with our children. Nobody expects us to have time for taking care of our grandparents as long as we have service institutions for elderly and disabled. One way to make it easier to take care of grandparents at home can be giving financial subsidies to the families. Another solution can be to lower the fees for families keeping their elderly at service flats in the neighbourhood and letting the grandparents visit their home in weekends, if possible. On the other hand, I believe that the children having no interest in taking care of the grandparents should put them into service institutions. Then there is a major concern that the service quality should be improved, because today there are too little activities for the old people, mainly because of the institutions financial problems.",0
33,0143.a2.txt,Adopt or not?,"There are millions of orphans around the world. In spite of this people keep on bringing new children to the world, instead of taking care of the ones which already exists. This problem could get solved if all the couples whose biological clock has started to tick, should adopt instead of having children on their own. 
To bear a child is something that is so deeply rooted in the entire mankind, since bringing new children to the world has been necessary in the past to keep on developing the human race. This is, of course, a strong instinct for man, just like it is for all animals. The big difference between man and other animals is that the earth is getting overpopulated by the human race. At the same time as millions of children are dying just because no one wants to or are able to take care of them, the space and the food is running short. Animals regulates overpopulation by diseases, the predatory animals eats weaker animals and herbivores reduces when there is not enough food for them all. Men, on the other hand, have medicines and we do not have to eat other men to survive. Because of this, our population is not regulated in that way. 
People which adopts children today, are usually people which cannot have children in a biological way. One of the prospective parents could, for example, be barren. The possibility to adopt children from all over the world makes those people able to satisfy their instincts and get children anyway. According to the people which have adopted children, there are no difference between the love to a biological child, and the love to an adopted child.
A positive thing with adoption, is that the government controls the prospective parents close and strict. They are controlled in the areas of suitability and how good they might take care of a child. They also has to have a regular and wealthy salary and they have to be married for several years before they can adopt, which should prove that they get on well as a couple. These controls forces people to think careful before they adopt a child. It is not possible to adopt because of a sudden impulse. This is something well thought-out, and it takes good planning to get through with an adoption. Today almost anyone can have a child anytime. It is not rare that the conception is a mistake. In the USA teenage pregnancies is one of the reasons why so many young girls drops out of school. A young teenager can hardly offer a child an adequate childhood, since teenagers seldom have enough money and time for a child. Besides that, it is not unusual that the father is gone by the time the baby arrives. 
Another reason for adopting instead of having biological children, is that the adoptive parents can choose the babies looks, in rough outlines that is. They can choose if the child should have light or dark skin, and they can even choose the sex of the child. Lots of adoptive parents finds this very positive. There are even people which adopts children just because of this. Scandinavians, for example, are often tired of their light, fine hair and their pale skin, and wishes that their children could get spared from that. In such occasions, adoption is an excellent solution. This could bring a greater mix of different nations and skin-colours without cultural clashes. Even now, it is getting more natural to mix light- and dark-skinned, big-nosed and short people, in schools and at workplaces. Gained adoption of foreign children would probably increase the tolerance towards people which doesn't look exactly like everybody else. Racism might even reduce, since the original, white Viking would more or less get erased. In one single family there could be five different nationalities. Racism and intolerance towards, for example, dark-skinned people could never survive in that kind of society.
To make this adopting-theory work, it is required that the government helps some families to finance an adoption, since the costs of adopting a child can get really big. Even an average-family should have the opportunity to adopt, even those families which haven't won the lottery. Adoption have to cost money of course, since the economy is one part of the controls which are made on prospective parents, but it shouldn't have to be about that large amounts.
To carry out a decision that would make people forced to adopt instead of having biological children would probably not be possible, since the government can't sterilize every woman in the entire country. Adoption must, for that reason, be a voluntary decision made by every single individual. The only thing that can be done, at this point, is to encourage prospective parents to choose adoption.",0
34,0146.a2.txt,Youths need motivation,"I would like to discuss a problem that is relevant to many young people in Sweden today. Many youths that after graduating from upper secondary school can't get a job and don't live with their parents might get income support from the welfare office. This system with income support is good, but it has some disadvantages when it is combined with a trainee post, which many of these youths get. I will here give you an example, which I think shows what I mean. A year ago a friend of mine was unemployed and received income support, and then he was assigned a trainee post. Since the municipality paid the wages they were very low, almost symbolic. Therefore he received income support to be able to pay rent and food. The welfare office had determined how much money he required during a month and they always gave him what was missing up to this amount. Because of this it didn't matter for him if he went to work or not, he got the money he needed anyway. In fact he saved money if he stayed home, since then he didn't waste it on bus fares. This makes it very tempting to take advantage of the system, which shouldn't be possible and therefore I think the system should be improved.
I think the system should be changed so it is profitable to go to work and unprofitable to stay at home and not the other way around. I can see two possible ways of improving this system. One is that they receive more money if they go to work. It only has to be a symbolic sum for motivation. The other is that they get less money if they stay at home, like with a regular employment. However, you can't expect them to live under subsistence level if they have to stay at home because of illness, for example. My opinion is that it is important that the system changes in one way or another so the youths become more motivated to go to their trainee posts. 
First of all I think it would be good for their health if it was profitable for these youths to go to their trainee posts. Because if they went to work they would meet new people and they would be doing something. This would probably make them feel useful and needed, which would lead to a better self-esteem. This is very good for their health both mentally and physically, since a problem for unemployed might be that the self-esteem gets lower and lower which leads to a feeling of uselessness and maybe even to depression.
Second of all I think it is good for moral reasons, because a person who lets other people work and pay taxes to support him (it could also be ""her"") I would call immoral. That is if he is capable of working and has a job to go to, but refuses only because of laziness. I strongly believe it is wrong to do so. I don't think there is anyone who wants to work and pay a big part of his income as taxes that are used to support someone else who instead of doing his work takes advantage of the system. And I think that these youths that are taking advantage of the system would understand that if they went to work, but as it is now they need motivation. 
Finally I think that if they took their trainee posts seriously they would get the work experience they need to get a real employment. An argument against trainee posts is that they are only temporary work with meaningless tasks and that there is no time left of the days to search for a real job. But I think it has to be seen from another angle. First of all there are trainee posts with meaningful tasks and the trainees are allowed to search other employment during working hours. And second of all then the youths would get the required work experience and, also, they are still on the work market, which makes it easier to get an employment. Employers often prefer someone who has recently been working instead of someone who has been unemployed and done nothing for a longer period. 
What I have been trying to say here is that it is very easy to take advantage of the system of income support. I mean it is very easy to think, ""why work if I don't have to"". Therefore I think that a change is needed to motivate the youths. A possible way of changing the system is to give the trainees a symbolic sum if they go to their trainee posts and there do what is required of them. Such a change might be possible, even though it costs the society, since there are gains to be made. The youths' mental and physical health would be better, their moral might improve and it would make it easier for them to get a real employment. As I see it, these gains are worth the money it costs.",0
35,0148.a2.txt,DUTY-FREE IS VITAL FOR THE BALTIC SEA,"I do not regret that I voted for EU and not against it but having said that there are many regulations that EU has conceived that I just cannot understand. For instance European Union has decided to cease the duty-free sale in the Baltic Sea. As far as I am concerned there are not any particular reasons for putting down the most important industry in the Baltic Sea except that this sort of opportunity is said to be unfair for the other EU-countries. Although mentioned above some drawbacks of EU, I would not have any hesitation to vote for it again but this argumentation is not about EU but the sea trade between Finland and Sweden.

I have doubts that they have not considered the consequences throughout in Brussels. If the duty-free sale finish in 1999 like it has been planned it will be a catastrophe. To whom, might one ask, and the answer is to everyone, that is, Swedes and the Finns. First of all there has been a lot of emigration from Finland to Sweden and vice versa. So for us who has to travel back and forth, these ferries offer us a great possibility to visit our families and friends with a reasonable price. There are of course aeroplanes but the difference between the prices is enormous and for example for me flying is absolutely impossible despite the student loan.

One can ask what has the duty-free sale got anything to do with travelling across the sea. Well, there is a logical explanation which is that the shipping companies make the profit by selling lots of duty-free products. Ferries survive because of the duty-free sale opportunity and not because of the ticket sale, tickets cost basically nothing.

So, what will happen if people will not travel by ferries when losing the possibility to buy cheap items? Unemployment will increase. Employees lose their jobs, which would be a disaster for approximately 5000 workers. Shipping companies cannot afford to keep all of their workers if there are no passengers.

The Baltic sea ferries are popular among the emigrants and immigrants but also among people who just want to relax for few days and cannot afford to travel all the way to Spain. Taking a cruise is a cheap way to get rid of the normal routine. Ferries offer lots of entertainment for all age-groups. There are for example restaurants, bars and nightclubs. Passengers can do some shopping, eat well and dance until four in the morning with help of cheap pints and fancy cocktails. Bearing in mind the employment situation, ferries also offer different sorts of jobs for the musicians and magicians, in one word entertainers.

The alcohol consuming is quite high in Scandinavia. Finland and Sweden have their alcohol monopolies and prices are high. If EU refuse individual's privilege to buy duty-free alcohol it will lead to a situation that a home distilling will increase worringly. Also smuggling will grow which will develope certain problems. People will commit crimes first of all by smuggling alcohol and secondly by selling it forward.

There are not any ways to close down the Baltic Sea trade. There are different solutions to keep this duty-free possibility by changing the routes. This means that if there is a route from Stockholm to Helsinki, which takes about twelve hours, they will change it in a way that the ferry goes to Tallin first and then to Helsinki. In that way people can buy duty-free products because Estonia is not a part of European Union. This voyage would take two or three hours extra but it would be worth it. Also √Öland has a special situation being an autonomous island which helps ferries to retain the duty-free sale if pulling up to the harbour.

Duty-free sale in the Baltic Sea gives a condition of ferries' excistence. It would be a disaster for everyone if a duty-free sale did not exist. It would be a catastrophe for me to lose this chance to travel in low-cost back to Finland. I do not have anything against aeroplanes but the fact is that living abroad for a year means that my luggage weight so many kilograms that I am not even allowed to enter the plane with all my stuff. Ferries also offer a great opportunity for the Finns to travel easily to Europe. I do not certainly want to lose ferries and the duty-free sale and believe me I am not the only one.",0
36,0149.a2.txt,Grants instead of loans to go to university,"Education is the key to a working society. Unemployment has been and still is a hard problem for a society do deal with.The state quite often tries to get a better situation by encouraging people to get educated. The problem is not always the lack of vacant jobs but the lack of well-educated people. How come then that there are still quite few people who choose to go to university after high school?
One main reason is probably that the system with loans does not attract people to get higher education. In Sweden students usually have to take loans to be able to finance their studies, especially if they are young and go to university directly after finishing high school. As a student you get a small amount of money from the state, a study grant. It is not very much money and certainly not enough to make a living. The students who do not take loans usually either live with their parents or somehow have the time to work while they study and finance their studies in that way. But combining studies mith work is not very common, as the loan system does not allow you to have an unlimited income during the studies. Otherwise the grants will be lowered. It is about the same thing concerning the study loans. You will not be able to borrow the full amount of money if the income has been too high during a year. That amount was in 1998 about 55 000 crowns. The main problem with taking a loan to finance the studies is that the present system makes it impossible for many students to ever be able to pay back the loan. You start to pay back your loan about six months after the finished studies. At present you pay four percent of what your income was two years ago when you start to pay back the loan. The problem is that the rent, which is made up by the government, usually is higher than four percent. As a consequence of that your loan grows while pay it off. At the age of 65, the loan will be written off. 
A lot of people presumably prefer to start to work after highschool instead of going to university. The problem with the loan system is probably one main reason. It is most probable that a lot of people prefer to earn their own money. That concerns especially young people who want to get a place of their own to live end become independent from their parents. A lot of people do not see the point in going to university and become indebted for the rest of their lives. Besides they miss their income during the time they study. Certainly, the loan does not have to be paid back in a way that it usually causes people financial troubles. But it must certainly be a psychological burden to be indebted and to be aware of that you will probably remain so for the main part of your life. Seeing it from another aspect, you can say that a loan is always a loan which has to be paid back. It gets more complicated when there is not only the studyloan that has to be paid back, but also other loans. The most common is that people take loans to buy an apartment or a house, maybe a car, furniture and other things. If then there is also a studyloan which has to be paid off, the financial situation can become very difficult.
The loans that are given to be able to study are supposed to make it possible for everyone to study. But the fact is that a lot of people do not go to university because they simply cannot afford it. Especially single mothers have problems with that, because they beside themselves also have a child or children to provide for. The fact that no grants or loans are given over the summer quite often causes students more problems. During the summer vacacion a lot of students have to work to be able to make a living. The loan system makes it hard for people to earn money while studying, because the grants and the loan is reduced after you have earned more than the permitted annual amount.
University students should be given grants, not loans, to finance their studies. If university students would be given grants and not loans, more people would probably choose to go to university. Now there are probably those who think that it is not the same thing to study at university as to work. It is not, but full time studies actually can be compared with a full time job. The only difference is that you are able to use your time more freely as a student and that you get occupation in a different kind of way. But there are always tasks which have to be done when you study, and you always have things to do. The conditions for working and studying are different, but there are also close points of similarity between them. 
Why should more people go to university then? There are many reasons. Society is always in need for well educated people. Education leads to development in the whole society. If grants instead of loans were introduced, it would probably tempt more people to go to university. The attitude to higher education would probably change. University studies do not always lead to a well-paid job, but a lot of people do study because it is stimulating for the personal development.In the long run it would favour everyone. If the loans were not a negative part of university studies university itself would probably be seen as more useful and accessible to everyone. The system of today does not work properly anyway. It should be an advantage to go to university and not a disadvantage, financially as well as intellectually.
I think that the whole system with the study allowences is in need for a change. Politicians always emphasize the importance of education, therefor higher education should not leed to debts. The unemployment would probably decrease if more people could go to university. It is never wrong of society to stake on education. Education is an investment for the future.",0
37,0150.a2.txt,We should not eat our friends.,"To realise something can be very difficult. Especially when it forces people to change the way they are living. It is hard when we decide not to eat our friends. But it is the only right decision and I am going to explain why.

I have been a vegetarian for almost two years. I can say I am doing it for many reasons. First of all I am a vegetarian for my own sake. It is not good for our health to eat too much meat. Meat contains a lot of fat, which makes it easier to get a heartcondition. Secondly I am a vegetarian because I care about the environment. Cattlefood needs strong artificial manuring. Because of that discharge from factories with animals destroys the subsoilwater and the soil. I am also a vegetarian because it is a waste of the world's resources to eat meat. A space of land used to produce vegetables can feed at least ten times as many people as if we give the vegetables to the animals and then eat them. All these arguments are good ones, especially the last one in this time of overpopulation. But it is all about becoming a vegetarian for reasons that in the end, in one way or another, affect us. 

The most obvious reason for becoming a vegetarian is one people tend to ignore. It is a truth so obvious it is hard to see. We can not eat our friends. Not because it is not good for our health, bad for the environment or a waste of land, but simply because it is wrong. Through being a vegetarian we do not participate in killing other creatures for our sake and we also repudiate the horrible conditions most animals live in, in our factories with animals today. A life of an animal brought up for the meatindustry today can not possibly be a life worth living. Most of them live their whole lives in very small areas. They are not able to go outside or hardly even turn around in their cages. When it is time to kill them it is often made in a brutal way to produce meat as cheap possible.

People often argue that it is our right to treat animals however we like since we are the most intelligent creatures on earth. But does this give us the right to violate and exploit the animals? I have a lot of times been asked what good me being a vegetarian is going to do when almost everyone else eats meat. But we have to start somewhere and more and more people mostly young ones, are starting to eat vegetarian-food. The more people who give up eating meat the fewer animals need to suffer. Another argument often heard is that animals do not have feelings. A foreign filosopher once said, ""the question is not whether they can think, but can they suffer"". The point is that we know animals can suffer. Everyone who has seen a calf part from its mother knows it feels grief. He who sees it knows it. 

If people were forced to kill the animals on there own and see their suffering to be able to eat meat, I think a lot of us would resist it. But as it is today it is very easy to go into a stoor and by a package of meat without having to reflect on what it is we are really eating. We do not have to see the pain in the eyes of the animals we are going to eat and we do not have to know about the conditions they have been living in if we do not want to. Since we humanbeings can live good lives without eating meat, I can not see other reasons than selfish ones for us continuing to do so.
There are no more questions to be asked. Our superior intelligence does not give us the right to make other creatures suffer. Not if we don't have to and we don't. It is the opposite - we need to let them be.",0
38,0155.a2.txt,More physical education at school,"Everybody knows that children are restless creatures. When they play their games it is often in a lively manner - they love to run, to jump and to chase each other. When children start school though, they enter a sedentary world in which they will have to spend a lot of time for many years. For a number of reasons, I would like to emphasise the need for more physical education at the schools today. In the last few years this subject has been cut down in the lowest grades as well as in upper secondary school. My main arguments will show that we have to look at this subject in a wider perspective. In the first place, physical exercise make learning in other subjects easier. Secondly, we have to reach the children already at school, to give them a life-long interest for exercising - this for the public health.
If we give children more physical exercise at school, this would not ""only"" improve their health - it would also support their learning in other subjects. Especially younger children need to develop their motor functions. If they get control over their body they will more easily learn skills as reading, writing and mathematics. This way to improve other skills is also efficient, because the children will have fun and get self-confidence, instead of maybe losing it in the classroom. Still many pupils have performance anxiety and feel bad during the sport lessons, you may say. But this is because the subject is based on too much competition and performance. I would like to see more exercising that is based on children's needs and more exercising at school in general. 
Furthermore children become more alert and can more easily concentrate if they get some exercise. For how long time during a lesson are the pupils really concentrating on their work? Exercising during other lessons than sports could just be the ability for pupils to move around in the classroom. To lighten up the ordinary lessons with more creative work as field studies for example, is a good way to get the children more interested and more eager to learn. To say that children have recesses when they can play may be right, but how much they exercise then vary from child to child, and when they get older they do not exercise much during the recesses. The recesses are also not ""real school"", because then you are sitting at your desk and have to do as the teacher says. In ""real school"" we need more exercising for children. This would improve their learning ability and make the school more creative and fun.
My second main argument is that the children of today need more exercising to become healthier and stronger and to feel better in mind and body. Their interests in the spare time have more and more turned into physical inactive activities. Many kids spend many hours a day in front of the television or the computer. Children have also been putting on weight and many are lacking in concentration at school. Some are totally inactive outside school. Therefore we need more physical education at school - to get a lasting interest for exercising and knowledge about a healthier way of life. In the long run people would get healthier and simply feel better and the State would save money on the medical service. 
Finally, physical education is socially healthy. Athletics and physical exercises make people come together as a team or as a group and they have hopefully fun together and co-operate. Most children also think that physical education is fun.
My conclusion is that we have a lot to win if we add more physical education to the curriculum. It is evident that the rising generation would need more exercise as their way of life has changed during the last decades - children sit still too much when they actually need to be out in the fresh air and play. We need new thinking at the schools today and a more creative way of learning. More physical exercise would in the long run make the pupils healthier and more alert, and their learning ability and self-confidence would improve.",0
39,0156.a2.txt,The DNA research must be regulated,"At this very moment scientists, all over the world, are struggling to chart the entire human DNA, in a project called HUGO. They hope that they, through this, will find cure to all genetic deceases. At the same time other scientists are trying to clone animals, because it would benefit the animal breeding if the best animals could be copied over and over again, and other scientists are manipulating crops. The DNA researchers maintain that this is completely harmless and nothing to worry about. But is this true? Should we believe them and let them do their work without interference?

There are, of course, advantages in DNA research, especially in the field of medicine. Many severe deceases could probably be avoided or treated with new medicines or methods that could be found with the help of DNA research. Already today many women who are in greater risk of getting breast cancer can have a DNA test to find out how big the risk is of catching the decease, and whether they should remove their breasts or not. This is good, but still there is some very serious dangers about our use of the DNA that we have to pay attention to.

One hazard is the DNA manipulation of crops. The DNA of the crops are manipulated to make the plants get extra big or to make them stand powerful insecticides and weed-killers. This brings on a lot of extra insecticides and weed-killers in the fields, which has a negative effect on the enviroment. But that is not all. All DNA in plants and animals mutate to adjust them to their enviroment. This is a very slow process, but nobody knows what happens with a manipulated gen that mutates. Will it result in an even more powerful plant that out grow other plants and threaten the multiplicity of nature? That is a frightening thought, but it is not unlikely that it happens, since all living things through mutation strive to survive better. 

Another kind of DNA manipulation is the new phenomenon cloning. Not long ago the first example of a DNA manipulated sheep was shown to the world. It was Molly, an exact duplicate of another sheep. This was a revolution in animal breeding, since it made possible to copy one induvidual's DNA and use it to create another individual with the exact same qualities as the first one. Now it will be possible to use the most profitable animals over and over again, which, of course, will benefit the farmers. But if we only use cloned animals, there will only be a few unique DNA-cromosomes among hundreds of animals, and that will make in-breed very likely. That will not be a problem if we steralise all animals and just produce more of them through cloning, but that would not be ethically right. We should not pretend that we are some kind of Gods. 

If we also start to clone people, the situation gets absurd. And it gets even worse if we, in the future, not just clone people, but also replace the genes that we do not want with better ones. Then we might get a society where only people with certain, well adjusted genes are accepted to universities, and where employers check your DNA before they deside whether or not they will hire you. That would be a society where your future would almost be determined before you were even born.

The conclusion of all this is, that if we do not have a world-wide ethical discussion about DNA, and if we do not get to the conclusion that the use of DNA and its information has to be strictly regulated, we will face a dark future.",0
40,0157.a2.txt,"Corridor or apartment, which is best?","In May last year I moved into a student-corridor in Flogsta here in Uppsala after having lived in an apartment for about four months. It was quite a big apartment and I had shared it with a friend. I was used to having a big kitchen and a big living-room for just the two of us, and the possibility to invite lots of friends. Living in a corridor meant big changes for me. I would have to share kitchen and living-room with eleven people I didn't know from the beginning. If I was unlucky I would get neighbours who stole my food from the refrigerator or used my kitchen-tools. Now I've lived there for almost a year, and ny now I know that I actually prefer to live like this. It suits me perfectly, at least for the moment I would not like to go back to living in an apartment, and now I'm going to tell you why.

If you live in a corridor with people you like, it's almost like getting a new, big family. There is always someone to talk to, if you're feeling lonely you can just go to the kitchen and if there's nobody there right at the moment, they will soon come. And if you feel that you want to be alone, you can go to your room and close the door. You have a choice that you wouldn't have if you lived alone in an apartment. I know I wouldn't be able to live in an apartment of my own right now. I would just sit staring out the window and feel lonely and miserable. But in the corridor I've always got some members of my ""family"" who wants to talk to me. Of course, I would probably study more if I wasn't tempted to spend so much time in the kitchen, but onthe other hand, if I felt sad and lonely I wouldn't get that much done either. What could be a problem, though, is that the people with whom you live know everything about you. They know when you leave and when you come home, and if you come home alone. There is much gossip in a place like that.

I think veerybody ought to try living this way at some time in their lives. You learn a lot about how to get along with other people. For me, this is especielly important, since I'm an only child and 'm not used to having to compromise with brothers and sisters all the time. Now I learn to take my responsibility in another way, for example, I have to clena the kitchen every time I've used it, I can't just leave my dirty plate in the sink, because I know how irritating it is when the others do that. If I lived by myself, I wouldn't care that much, because it would only be my own dirty kitchen and nobody would tell me to clean up. Another thing you learn is of course to share things, and that makes it even more important to wash the dirty saucepans and plates, since someone else will want to use them.

The way I see it, this kind of living is very good. I've already mentioned the main arguments, but there are of course others as well. If you forget to buy something there is always somebody in the corridor from whom you can borrow it. Or if you are ill and can't get out of bed, the others can take care of you and go shopping for you. If you live by yourself there is a risk that you can't get anything to eat for days if you're too ill to go out.

I feel that I know quite well what I'm talking about when I say that everybody should live with other people like this for a period in their lives, because I've lived both in a corridor and in a shared apartment, and, before that, all by myself in a very small room when I studied in Paris. I don't think I can find a better way of living at this period in my life. I know that I need to be close to other people, or I would be depressed and lonely. I've learned a lot",0
41,0158.a2.txt,Let's sleep!,"Some people can be perfectly satisfied with getting only six hours of sleep per night. These people often seem to be feeling good and awake. This, however, surely isn't the case. I believe that when you need a cup of coffee to stay alive or have to pinch yourself to keep your eyes from closing in the middle of a good movie, you're in serious trouble.

There are a number of reasons as to why I myself almost always go to bed around ten o'clock in the evening when I know that I have to get up early the next morning. Some of my friends used to have trouble understanding how this habit could make a difference in a person's life. I at the same time didn't really know how to explain it to them until I came across a study that had been done in America. This study showed that a big part of the American population doesn't get enough sleep. This means that most of the American men and women don't spend more than six hours in bed, when they according to this study should be asleep for at least ten hours per night. This is in order to keep away from becoming some kind of zombie who put other people's lives at risk. 

To me this idea of improving the quality of your own life makes perfect sense. Probably you'll feel the same way after you've read my reasons as to why we all should sleep a whole lot more than we do today.

I claim that people who ignore their need of sleep are in fact lethal. This is because when someone is tired and suffers from insomnia there are certain things that this person shouldn't be doing, like driving a car or be responsible for medication and children. Still, this is exactly what's going on everywhere around you all the time.

To illustrate this I'll give an example of what could happen on a normal day, around the time when the sun rises. At this time of day it would be possible to spot a little red car on the road. Let's say that a young nurse, who has just left the hospital, where she has worked all night, drives this car. When she arrives home she wonders who on earth drove the car, because she can't remember doing it herself. This is dangerous.

Now you'd wish for her to just get into bed and let her body recover from all the stress that's been put on her. But what does she do? Well, since her husband is still asleep, she has to take their two-year-old baby the day care centre before she can relax. So she changes the baby-boy's diaper, put clothes on him and then carries him to the car.

During the ride to the day care centre the boy doesn't really make a lot of noises, since he too is quite tired. Perhaps this is why his mother forgets all about his existence as she drives the car. Arriving at the end of their journey, the mother walks into the nursery school while her baby is still sitting in the car. Of course she remembers him a few minutes later, bur isn't this dangerous? Still she's not alarmed at all and so she gets into the car once again to drive home. Although this story is fiction it could happen and it probably does happen all the time in real life.

Except for the fact that sleep-deprivation is very much deadly it also causes trouble in relations between people. I believe that if everybody slept as much as they should we would have a happier society all over the world. Everybody knows that you get cranky when you haven't slept enough and naturally this has to affect the people around you as well. We would probably have a lot less divorces than we do now if everybody took responsibility for their own sleeping-habits. Not only would we feel much safer, but also instead of looking like gloomy skeletons, we would all be sleeping beauties.",0
42,0159.a2.txt,Shorter Business Hours for Shops!,"Today it is possible to go shopping in Sweden at practically any hour of the day. The opening hours of the shops are getting longer and longer. Many people see this as a positive development, because it is just about always possible to purchase what one needs. But while looking a bit further into what the results of this really are, one finds several reasons to change the situation back to how it used to be. Sweden would gain from this, not only economically but also when it comes to the well-being of the people; those working in the shops as well as those shopping.
The economical aspect is of course an important one, which affects all of us. When the shops are open longer, people get used to buy what they need at different hours of the day and therefore spread their shopping over a longer period of time. But they do not necessarily buy much more. While comparing two chain stores belonging to the same chain of shops, but with different opening hours, it is naturally often found that the total turnover is higher in the one with the longer opening hours. This does not mean that it is the more profitable of the two, however. Actually the stores with the shorter opening hours are often more profitable. They have higher average turnover, in comparison to the working-hours. While it does not pay off to have longer business hours many stores lose money this way today. The customers spread their shopping for a longer period and shop assistants must be paid for a longer time, often with unsocial hours bonuses. This means that in the long run the prices will have to rise.
As mentioned above this development makes the conditions hard for many store owners and other people working in the shops. In many areas (for example shopping malls) the stores must be open at determined hours. In Uppsala, for example, the opening hours in the city is 10 a.m.- 7 p.m. on Monday to Friday. On Saturdays it is 10 a.m. - 4 p.m., except for one Saturday a month (called ""l√•ngl√∂rdag""), when the shops stay open until 5 p.m. And as if this was not enough it was recently decided that the shops situated in town should be open one Sunday a month between noon and 4 p.m. For smaller shops, whose owners might not afford to hire more personnel, this is almost impossible to manage. In some cases the shop keepers themselves might be the only shop assistants. The result is often that the store owners have to work inhumanly long hours. Some supermarkets and grocery stores have even longer opening hours and are often open on Sundays. For those who work in retailing, and that is quite a lot of people, this means odd and uncomfortable working-hours, and it is more and more common that couples have to work at totally different hours.
Naturally our whole society is changed by these new, longer opening hours. People are getting used to go shopping in a new way. Mainly this has meant that they go shopping later in the evening on workdays and in the afternoon on Saturdays. Another thing is that many families seems to think that to go shopping is the perfect family pleasure on a Sunday. It seems to have replaced many other activities, which might be more valuable to do together. Instead of taking a walk in the woods, playing a family game, or going skiing people take their children shopping. This is a very sad thing to see. There is a purpose with a common free day. One day every week most people should be able to stay home from work to spend time with their close ones in a way more worthwhile than that. Life in our time is hectic enough as it is.
The expansion of the opening hours have meant different things for different people. It has changed the way of living for many of us, often negatively. But this is not at all how it has to be. Society most certainly managed well before, and it is very seldom that one really must shop on a Sunday. Of course it feels nice to know that it is possible to do so almost whenever one wants, but while weighing the pros and cons, it is clear that we should go back to the way it used to be.",0
43,0161.a2.txt,Why Sweden need a state-controlled company for the sale of alcoholic beverages,"Systembolaget AB has got a monopoly of selling wine, liquor and strong beer in Sweden. No one else is allowed to provide this service. According to the law governing the sale of alcoholic beverages, wine, liquor or strong beer may not be sold or made available to persons under the age of twenty. Systembolaget AB is a state-controlled company founded in 1954. Today it has about 400 shops throughout the country. When Sweden became a member of the European Union in 1995 the State monopoly was questioned. Critics said that Systembolaget was out-of-date and that it had no place in today's society. People claimed that we had to adapt to the rest of Europe, but the Commission of the European Union made no such demand. The debate whether or not to keep Systembolaget is still a burning issue in our country. 
There are several reasons to keep Systembolaget. First, a state-controlled company for the sale of alcoholic beverages is the best way to keep down the consumption. The Swedish people has always been a drinking one. In the nineteenth century male workers were often given a part of their salary in vodka. There were lots of accidents at the working sites and the production went down. Today we drink only a fraction of what we used to do back then. One explanation is that the sale is controlled nowadays. Another important reason is the taxes, which have led to an augmentation of the price. Systembolaget AB is not trying to increase sales in order to make a better profit. This circumstance distinguishes them from an ordinary company. There is no publicity, there is only neutral information to help the clients to find what they want. Open competition would certainly increase the consumption notably. It is quite obvious that every shopkeeper would try to sell as much as possible in order to earn more money. 
Second, alcohol is a matter that concerns the entire society and not only the person who is consuming it. As we all know alcohol causes a lot of problems that society has to deal with at some point. Alcohol-related accidents are very common and crimes are often committed under the influence of alcohol. Some people become violent when they drink and innocent persons might get hurt. As a matter of fact, social problems and medical treatments caused by alcohol costs the Swedish people about 80 billions every year. The tax-payers are those who have come up with this huge amount of money. If we can keep down the consumption we can also reduce the social and the medical problems. The tax-payers' money can then be used in other areas instead.
Another reason to keep Systembolaget is that it is a well-functioning institution which guarantees both freedom of choice and high quality. Generally, monopoly is not associated with freedom of choice. From this point of view Systembolaget is quite an unusual monopoly. As a matter of fact, the client can choose between 2000 different types of wines, spirits and strong beers. This is not only the case for those who live in a big city, the same thing goes for all those who live in the country. Besides, the staff is well-informed and competent and always ready to answer questions and give suggestions. All products on sale have first been tested in the laboratories in order to check the quality. Therefore the client can always feel secure. An ordinary grocery would never have this possibility. 
It is important to stress that Systembolaget AB has developed and adapted to modern requirements in order to please the clients and improve the service. The company has for example opened several shops with self-service. Systembolaget is certainly not out-of-date. On the contrary, it is quite obvious that it still has an important role to play in today's society. Open competition seems attractive to some people though. If the State monopoly was abolished you would not have to queue every Friday afternoon and you could get hold of a bottle of whiskey even on a Sunday evening in the grocer's shop around the corner. However, the arguments for a monopoly are much more relevant. It is very important to think in broader terms. Alcohol is not only a matter for the individual citizen, it is a matter for the entire society. Thus it is easy to see why Sweden need a state-controlled company for the sale of alcoholic beverages.",0
44,0162.a2.txt,Is television good or bad for children?,"Does children know that everything on the television is not real? Can we blame television for being one of the reasons for the increasing violence in society?
Sweden is one of the countries in the world that have a large amount of television programmes that turns directly to children. The programmes are both educational aswell as fictitious.

It is a fact that children learns a lot through television. Through their own fantasy, their non-real world and through medias non-real worlds, the children learns how to experiment with different identities and conflicts. They learn how to play with these fantasies in their own game or in real life, nad through their own action they will meet love, encourage, disappointments or other reactions. 
Of course television is good for children to a certain level and just as long as they have an adult that can give them some sort of guidance through the programmes and at the same time give them explanations to different events. It is not the television that has the responsibility to raise the children. Unfortunally parents of today have no time for ""quality time"" with their children and as a result of that many children end up in front of the TV.

There is a lot of talk about whether television should transfer incorrect valuations and inspire to harmful actions. Does children really know how to create their own identity? 
I think that their own safety and certainty has a determining factor to whom they will identify themselves with. I also think that the social background and differences in knowledge and experiences really does matter when they choose a person they like. Children needs to get impressions from outside when they creating an identity, but I don't think that they should get as many impressions through television as they do. Children didn't have any problems to find their identity when there was no television.

I don't think that children knows how to separate fantasy from reality when they are watching TV on their own. At least not when they are at a young age. For them the TV is like a magic window that reduces something that happens in real life. Programmes of today are fast and every now and then there is a commercial break. I think that film and television for children nowadays doesn't have the educational quality that is supposed to provide them with knowledge for a longer time. As a result of the high tempo and all the commercial breaks, they are not able to reflect and attach to all the features.

I don't want to say with this that I think that we should stop children from watching TV, but as it is today I think that the focusing on violence has increased even in programmes for children. Film and television shows us too often how to solve problems and conflicts with violence and this, I am sure, has led to why society looks in the way that it does today.
Of course we cannot blame all the troubles on media, but I think that a lot of it comes from there. We all live in a very demanding society and nowadays more people wants a career, it is more important, and at the same time we have less time for our children. But if we then want to use media as a ""babysitter"", why don't the media adapt the programmes in a better way. I don't think that it is the people that should adapt themselves to the media, it is rather the reverse.

To prevent children from watching non- approved programmes there should be some kind of age limit when it comes to renting videos that has a more violent caracter. What I want to say with this is that this is solely a way to protect our children from getting the wrong impressions of real life. Their knowledge in how to behave should come from parents, relatives and their teachers in the first hand. Television has become too fictitious and should come in the second hand when the children knows how to separate fantasy and reality.",0
45,0163.a2.txt,Imprisonment - a bad solution,"Do you think that imprisonment is a just and natural penalty for somebody who has committed a felony? Do you think that imprisonment prevents crime and protects the public? You had better reconsider, because this is not the case. Imprisonment, as punishment in general, is based on certain principles. It should, for example, deter people in general from criminality, as well as ""cure"" criminals, that is, deter them from relapsing. It should also protect society from dangerous convicts. However, my main argument is that imprisonment serves neither of these purposes. I will not discuss the ethical and moral aspects of imprisonment as a punishment, only the practical. 

To begin with, the deterrent effect of imprisonment is not as good as one could wish for. Of course nobody wants to go to gaol, but still, exemplary punishment does not work satisfactorily, as new crimes are obviously being committed all the time. One reason for this is that someone who commits a felony naturally counts on not being caught. Another reason that can be applied here in Sweden is the remarkably good conditions in the prisons and the fact that most prisoners are released before the stipulated time is at an end. I would say that Swedish prisons are the least deterrent ones in the world.

As to ""cure"" individual convicts, imprisonment is no great success either. When finally released, the former prisoner might actually be revengeful and even more disposed to committing crimes than before. Another problem is that young criminals in prison are likely to be influenced by older and more experienced prisoners to be more violent and commit more serious crimes. 

Being imprisoned, and especially being forced to live under the awfully bad, not to say inhuman, conditions that you can easily find in foreign prisons, might cause you psychological damage. It is not unlikely that a prisoner develops a mental disturbance, which of course is a disadvantage to society as a whole as well as to the affected individual. In combination with, for instance, a desire for revenge, the prisoner might be a threat to the public when he or she is released. Besides, even if the former prisoner is entirely sane, readjusting to normal life can be very difficult. Imprisonment is thus a very destructive punishment.

But surely it cannot be denied that imprisonment protects the public from dangerous criminals? Yes, it can, because we are only protected against those who are imprisoned for the moment. Consider for a moment that most of them will eventually be discharged, and add to them all those who commit felonies without being convicted, and the undetected psychopaths that probably exist to some extent in society. Do you feel secure just because there are prisons? No; on the whole they do not make much difference. Yet the existence of prisons creates a feeling of security in people, because they can be sure that they will not be subjected to the particular convicts that are imprisoned for the moment. They also know that the state takes its responsibility by punishing criminal deeds. If people did not have this feeling, however deceitful it is to me, society would face great problems. The question is: would the public feel secure and have trust in the authorities if prisons were abolished? I do not think that they could be completely done away with, but they could to a considerable degree be replaced by other penalties.

So far I have not mentioned the economic aspects of this question, something that in most cases is very important. Prisons, and again the Swedish ones especially, are expensive to run. The state has to provide for the prisoners, and perhaps their families too, by granting social allowances, and also pay for the rehabilitation after the release.

Imprisonment is thus both ineffective and uneconomical. I wish to see more of constructive and inexpensive penalties, such as community service and probation by an electronic shackle, and more specialised treatment of young convicts. In the long run, society is negatively affected by the existence of prisons.",0
46,0165.a2.txt,To preserve a language,"In these times of Anglicisation of languages there are some countries fighting against this development. The best known among these are France and Iceland. In various ways the people of these nations try to protect their languages against the wave of English and anglicised words. I understand the countries defending their languages and I think that what they are doing is right. In this essay I will try to show that they are taking a step in the right direction.

People in other countries think that what the French and the Icelanders are overprotective and too conservative; they say that countries should not be against a natural development of one language - in this case English - becoming a world language. But in some countries the opposition to this development creates a very strong nationalism and feeling of togetherness. In the case of Iceland, a country with a very small population (only 275, 000 inhabitants), this nationalism is very important to keep the language alive. In Reykjav√≠k the government has created a committee charged with making new Icelandic words replace foreign ones. France, on the other hand, is not fighting for the existence of its language, but for a top-ranking on the list of world languages. This also creates nationalism; a ""political nationalism"" which in some respects is very extreme in not allowing English words in advertisements and other ""public texts"". Moreover, the television channels must show French films during at least 40 % of their broadcasting time. This may seem very restrictive but I do not think the laws are unusually strict considering the goal: to preserve the language.

Even though some of these measures taken can be seen as overprotective and too conservative I believe that they are necessary in order to preserve the languages and to avoid words like the half Swedish half English 'shoppa' and 'printa'. These half foreign words can, however facilitate the learning of a dominant language like English, because then the learner already has an idea of what the word can mean in the new language. But, of course, if being forced to learn both the foreign word and the word from one's own language one gets a broader knowledge of etymology. This phenomenon of ""invented words"" in Icelandic and French can be a help when foreigners learn these languages, because if the learner knows a large number of short common words he is more likely to figure the meaning of longer solid compound words. One example of this in Icelandic is the word for 'copying machine' which is 'lj√≥sritari', meaning 'light drawer'. In French there is the word for 'snow-plough' which is 'chasse-neige' meaning 'snow chaser'. These invented words force serious learners to find out the meaning of three words (lj√≥s, ritari and lj√≥sritari), thus learning three words instead of one.

Is it worth while for the countries to struggle? I think there are strong arguments for it. Iceland not only preserves its ancient language, but is also getting attention abroad for the struggling and its success and in this way spreads the message that it is worth the effort if a country really wants to preserve the originality of its language. People in France and the French government's defending against the influx of English - in spite of their perseverance being somewhat more extreme - also gives the wanted result. These two peoples concern about their languages will no doubt bear fruit in the future in passing over feeling of pride to coming generations. One strong argument for trying to preserve one's language is that so much of the national identity is embedded in the language.",0
47,0167.a2.txt,"One of the common replies to such an argument as I have mentioned above, is that alcohol also is one of the main reasons to this kind of problems. ""So, if alcohol is legal, why should not narcotics be"", the advocates of the legalisation of narcotics would say. But, making one terrible mistake does not entitle us to make another one. It is true that we do already have a lot of trouble in our society due to alcohol, which is sad enough. But I do not believe in making alcohol illegal, though, because the use of it has such deep traditional roots in our history and I think this tradition with, for example, the ceremony to drink a toast to someone on a special occasion, would therefore be extremely difficult to change.","The matter of whether to legalise narcotics or not has been lively discussed for many years. Despite that fact, it is still a current subject of importance not to be ignored, especially due to the lately increasing use of narcotics by the teenagers, as a ""weekend-ecstasy"". This is a rather complex topic to discuss, why I have chosen three main subjects to concentrate on: 
 Would the curiosity decrease and lead to less use of narcotics, if the drugs where legalised? 
 Is it up to every single individual to make their own decision whether to use drugs or not - while no one else would have to suffer? 
 The society already has huge costs referring to the use of alcohol, so why would alcohol be legal if narcotics are not? 
Personally, I find myself to be quite curious. I also want to make my own decisions as an individual. But still I am very determined that the legalisation of narcotics would lead to a terrible and unnecessary decay of the Swedish society.

Even if I where curious enough to test narcotics, I do not believe I would be less curious if it was legal. On the contrary I think the legalisation would increase my possibility of trying narcotics, because it would be much easier to get hold of it. It would probably be considerably cheaper to. A legalisation would actually bring the message that ""narcotics can not be that bad - after all, it is accepted"", which would make even more people have a liberal view of narcotics. I am sure that would definitely lead to an increase of the use of it, according to many psychological studies.

From another psychological point of view, it seems to be rather important that you, as an individual, feel that you have the possibility to make your own decision how to live your life. I agree, as long as your actions do not have a negative effect on other people. But this is just the point that makes the argument that ""every individual has the right to make their own choice whether to take narcotics or not"" is not a durable argument why narcotics should be legal. People might think that using drugs is really ""up to them"", no one else has to suffer. But that is certainly not true. The whole society suffers of many effects that could easily be referred to drugs. A considerable part of the criminality and health-care-costs and the costs of treating the lately escalating number of adolescent people who need psychological help due to the use of the rather new, and among youths very popular drug, ecstasy are just a few examples of the negative effects. 
The worst effect of how the use of narcotics effects people in the user's surrounding is the social one, I think. My best friend's brother has been using narcotics of different kind since he was about 13 (he is 36 today). He will never become a mature, responsible adult, even if he would succeed in getting rid of his addiction to drugs (one of the effects of hashish is that it stops the psychological development if used during the adolescent). His use of drugs has effected his whole family's life in many tragic ways, and it still does. 
Unluckily, the argument that every single person must have the possibility to make their own choice, advocating for legalisation of narcotics, is often considered to be one of the most attractive to the youths during their process to become free and independent individuals.

Another point is that the decomposition of alcohol is much faster than that of marijuana for instance. Marijuana may remain in the body up to about 30 days. That would make it impossible to most people to actually use narcotics even in the weekends, if they are not going to be intoxicated during their time at work. If you drink alcohol in a Saturday evening, you can be pretty sure to be free from it in the Monday morning. But if you smoke a joint of marijuana, you will never know if you are going to have ""flashbacks"" any time in the following 30 days or not. I do not think that even advocates for the legalisation of narcotics would like to be operated by a doctor intoxicated by marijuana, ecstasy or any other drug. 

As I mentioned above, the whole society suffers already in many different ways due to drugs of different kinds. Legalisation of narcotics would make that suffering even worse, because it would increase the use of narcotics. It is also certainly not true that the drug-users do not effect any other people. The argument that narcotics ought to be legal because alcohol is legal can not be taken as a durable argument either. If we wish a society where most people are given the possibility to grow up in harmony and become empathetic and responsible adults who cares about other people, we have to make sure that narcotics will never be legalised here in Sweden.",0
48,0168.a2.txt,The Ivory Trade-why the selling of elephant ivory should be made legal,"Ivory trading dates back hundreds of years, and did not present any serious threat to the elephant populations until the sudden influx of whites into Asia and Africa during the last two centuries. Following this, the Indian and African elephant populations have since plummeted. The Great White Hunter decimated the vast herds until only a few hundred remained. Ivory that then constituted the proud trophies of these hunts came into focus of environmentalists. Following a successful campaign, an international agreement banning the trade of elephant ivory was signed. However, lately this ban has come under fire. The rise of elephant populations, along with the increasing poverty of the African countries in particular, has changed the elephant, in the eyes of local populations, from an endangered species to a pest. In this essay, I shall therefore argue for a lifting of the ban on the trading of elephant ivory. My arguments are based on giving elephants the status of a resource rather than a pest. The economic incentives for farmers and the government, will protect them better than laws. My essay shall explain this further. I shall also take into account the counter-arguments of my proposal. 

The ban on ivory trading was mostly concerned with the African elephants. These had, as mentioned above, suffered as massive drop in numbers due to over-hunting by whites wanting a trophy, or professional hunters supplying carvers, who created status goods. The ban allowed the elephants to increase in number. 

Yet in recent years African farmers have remained poor and become more dependent on agriculture as a source of income. Elephant herds eat vast amounts of food; crops and trees. Herds destroy crops when migrating. To protect resources, elephants are killed, much like pests, despite laws protecting them. If elephants themselves had the monetary value of a resource, farmers would have less reason to eradicate them. Pests are creatures which destroy resources without having any value themselves. However, one does not kill a pest which can produce money. Currently, farmers know ivory has a black market value, and feel bitter over rangers burning tusks they have confiscated. Poverty only increases this bitterness. In India, elephants are not as mistreated as their African counterparts because they have value(1).

Both government and elephant would, for two reasons, also benefit from lifting the ban. Firstly, the selling of ivory would allow nature reserves to fund themselves. This would allow the governments to divert funds to more pressing issues. Currently rangers shoot elephants to keep numbers down and burn their tusks. In South America state selling of furs from endangered monkey species has allowed more funds to be diverted to the preservation of these species. Secondly, governments wish to use the resources available to generate the income needed to care for their population. They are reluctant to set aside land for nature reserves, as elephants generate little income in proportion to the land used(2). Giving elephants the status of a natural resource would create an economic justification for their continued existence. Therefore, if elephants had value besides adding to the diversity of the savannah, governments would be more willing to grant elephants land, allowing their numbers to increase. Governments of poor countries will respect the income elephants can bring in more than laws banning ivory sales(3). 

Of course, similar schemes have failed when countries were unable to provide proper regulation. This is especially true of poor countries. However, many reserve rangers make up what they lack monetarily and legally, with loyalty, determination and sheer bloody-mindedness. If the local population had incentive to protect elephants from poachers, they could be used to guard herds too. Currently, they have none. Legalising ivory trade would also stop poachers. Buyers of ivory will buy tusks from a legal source, rather than obtaining it illegally.

Though I find it sad that humans need an economic justification to allow the continued existence of creatures, the fact that this is deplorable, does not change the reality of it. In the current world of free markets, the best way to protect something, is to give humans an economic reason to do so. Lifting the ban on the trade of elephant ivory would do that for elephants. For better, for worse, appealing to human greed would seem to be the best way to protect the elephant from extinction. 

(1) Indian elephants are in fact much more integrated with humans than African elephants, raised lovingly by individuals, and highly valued and respected by the rest of the population. They are used as beasts of burden and have religious significance. When domesticated elephants die, their bells are hung above a plaque designating whom they belonged to, much like a gravestone.

(2) This has changed somewhat in recent years what with the upswing in eco-tourism. However, since most creatures living on the African savannah are migratory, they require vast areas to live on, and are therefore hard to find. Some tourists are unwilling to pay money on the off-hand chance of seeing wild-life, forcing guides to use abusive methods to force wild-life to the tourists.

(3) This is not to say that these governments endorse the killing of elephants, but they do have schemes to keep their numbers down, and some agencies will turn a blind eye to local farmers killing them if they destroy crops. A single elephant can destroy the livelihood of an entire family.",0
49,0169.a2.txt,More Swedish pop groups should sing in Swedish,"Pop groups and pop stars play very important parts in teenagers' lives. They identify with artists or groups in many ways, for example by paying much attention to the lyrics of the songs. Increasingly more Swedish pop-acts gain success abroad and as a result to this more Swedish pop groups tend to start singing in English. 

Unfortunately it is practically obligatory for pop groups to write their lyrics in English, if they want to become worldwide famous. Those who sing in Swedish might be successful in other Scandinavian countries, but not in the rest of the world. When a Swedish pop group does gain success abroad, other Swedish artists realize that it's possible to come from Sweden and at the same time have worldwide success. And since it is essential to write English lyrics, they do. I believe that this development is bad for the young people in Sweden who need various musical role models. Since their Swedish idols don't sing in Swedish, they might feel that English is more ""cool"" and that the attitude towards Swedish might get worse. Swedish teenagers need music in Swedish since the language, among other things, helps them to feel connected to others and increases the feeling of belonging somewhere. Just as much as they need role models in real life, they need other forums where they can find guidance and identify with others, through magazines, TV-series, books and music. When trying to find people and opinions to identify with, music-wise, I believe it is important to find lyrics that they really understand and speak to them in their own language. Teenagers need young role models from their own country who have been growing up under the same circumstances and have same experiences. Listening to an American rap about American society couldn't be the same thing as listening to a song about the Swedish situation. 

The many new Swedish pop acts that have aroused lately support this argument. The need for good music in Swedish has been obvious this winter, when Swedish pop charts have been crowded by new, young Swedish music. Groups like Lok, Petter and Kaah express anger and frustration that have been recognized by many Swedish teenagers and probably wouldn't have had the same penetration if the lyrics were in English. The need for this kind of music is obviously enormous. These artists have had the same upbringing and sing or rap about the same society as Swedish teenagers live in and know. Groups who sing in English, and have the urge of gaining success outside of Sweden most often sing about things that people in different countries can rely to.

Unfortunately many Swedish pop groups don't seem to put that much of an effort into writing idiomatic English lyrics for their songs. They seem to write what they think sounds like good English, even though in many cases it don't. The English they perform, and which teenagers adopt, is not as good as expected. The demands for a lyric in Swedish to be perfect are much bigger than the demands for the ones in English. Many artists have been complaining over the years that writing lyrics in Swedish is too hard, and that English words have a better sound. But I believe that it just takes longer time to complete a good Swedish lyric and those who has been worked on usually turn out quite well.

It is however more or less legit nowadays to spice up Swedish in general with some English words and expressions every once in a while. I believe that the penitration of English in Swedish society is too rapid and unnecessary. The loanwords from English might lead to an impoverishment of the Swedish language and it might be used as a shortcut; instead of inventing new words we borrow English words. This development might arouse even more since teenagers today are used to having English around them all the time. They watch American TV-shows more frequently than Swedish ones and they listen to music in English. These are just two examples of the big flood of new English influence. English has become an increasingly common input in Swedish society; Swedish people don't even seem to react to this fact anymore. Teenagers are used to Swedish ice hockey teams with English names, companies and different brands are other examples. The message they get is that English is a better language than Swedish and that English should be used preferable. As long as the cool music is sung in English and the not so cool music is sung in Swedish, this situation strengthens. Perhaps the government or some other department should in some way encourage young people to write more music in Swedish. It's not up to me to say exactly how this would be preformed, but I think that much could be done to make the Swedish music-scene more various and vivid.

In short, the Swedish teenagers of today need to feel that their language is just as good as English. One good way to strengthen this opinion is to provide good Swedish music for them, with artists with the same background and with similar experiences. They need role models from the music industry that they can rely to.",0
50,0171.a2.txt,HOMOSEXUALS AS PARENTS?,"I have always fancied myself as a broad-minded person ready to accept almost anything in life; so when I was faced with the complex question of whether homosexuals should be allowed to adopt or have children through insemination I realized that I was not able to accept it. The questions I want to discuss in my essay are: is society ready to accept homosexuals as parents? How does it affect the children when they are brought up in a family where both parents are of the same sex?

According to Swedish law homosexuals are not permitted to adopt children, yet forty thousand children have homosexual (from adoption or through insemination). To be able to adopt in Sweden the person/s/ has to conceal his or her homosexuality which is not fair on the child. I believe that an adoption has to be approached from the child's angle and not looked upon as a right for the adult, the welfare of the child should always come first.

I do not condemn homosexuals or even question their ability to parenthood, everyone has the right to sexual preference; my main concern however is the psychological wellbeing of the child. Society is responsible to provide an environment for the adopted child where he or she has the possibility to develop in the best possible way. I also think that the psycho- logical development of the child will be put at risk if the parents are homosexuals; even though they would probably provide love, care and show responsibility towards the child. However to grow up with homosexuals as parents will be tough on the child since he or she will constantly be confronted with prejudice attitudes towards both male and female homosexuality from other people. In my opinion this will be a mental strain on the child. Futhermore a child should grow up with the clear understanding that children can only be conceived through a sexual relation between a man and a woman.

One can argue that would it not be better for a child to be raised in a family with happy, loving and caring homosexual parents rather than in a family of heterosexual parents that are always fighting? Of course the family environment has to be a healthy one; but I am still concerned with the way these children will be treated outside of their homes. Homo-sexuality is still not completely accepted in society and these people are often harassed and ridiculed because of their sexual orientation; to let a child be exposed to these prejudiced attitudes all the time must be placing unnecessary emotional strain on the child.

I think the association people have when they see homosexuals is not what they are like as people or parents, but we associate with the actual sexual acts they perform with each other. A lot of people find it offensive, vulgar and not normal and this is probably the core of the problem for homosexuals to be treated as other ""normal"" people in society. This could also be one of the main points why society is not ready to accept homosexuals as parents. I maintain however that children need both a male and a female rolemodel so they can identify themselves with both sexes. It must be very confusing to have either two mothers or two fathers; who is who in the relationship, and who will the child identify him or herself with. 

Iceland is the only country in the world where registered homosexual partners have the ame right as heterosexuals to adopt children. So even from a global point of view it seems like the majority of people are not ready to accept homosexuals as parents and I believe it will take a long time to change the attitudes on this subject.

As I mentioned before this is a very complex issue and one cannot state that homosexuals are not capable of being good parents. We live in a world which is full of prejudice and therefore one always has to consider what is best for the child and therefore in the interest of what is best for the children why should we add extra stress to their everyday lives; it might be difficult enough to live with the fact that one has been adopted why then add more emotional strain by having homosexual parents? No we are not yet ready for homo-sexuals as parents if we ever will be.",0
51,0172.a2.txt,The computer is here to stay.,"More and more people are buying computers nowadays. And more people with a low income have the chance to rent or buy these computers through their unions or employers. The computer industry is growing very fast and it might be quite difficult for people to do without a computor in the future. I believe that we have to accept the fact that the computor is here to stay. In this essay I will first of all illustrate three main arguments against the use of computers and in the second half three main arguments in favour of this use.

The computor has been a part of our society for some years now. Some people might think it quite unnecessary to have one if you don't study or have a job that require computer use. Computers are expensive and perhaps students have difficulty financing one. And since these machines grow out of date so quickly it may seem like a bad investment. 

In the second place, it is perhaps possible that some people get lazier when they sit all day in front of a computer. In all kinds of ways. If you use your computer to write, for example, an essay it is unnecessary to own a dictionary since you have word processing that takes care of spelling problems and bad grammar. Encyclopaedias will be less useful if you have the internet, where there are lots of information to be found. Computer users will not have the need to go or take the bus to the library since there are so many things that the computer can achieve. Looking at it from a health perspective this is not an advantage to human beeings.

Thirdly, the computer might split up families. Many children sit in front of computers playing computer games for hours. When children search for information on the internet they might come across inappropriate subjects, for instance, pornographic pictures and propaganda from political extremist groups. And since children and their parents sit in front of the computer one at a time the parents don't always see what the children are up to. But one of the main problems is that the members of the family hardly ever get the chance to gather and communicate. 

Perhaps it is time for some people with conservative attitudes to realise that the computer is a necessity in society of today. Instead of trying to oppose oneself to the development of modern technology we must try to make the best of the situation. And since the children, who are now growing up, are born with computers and use them everyday at school it has become a natural phenomenon for them.

E-mail is one of the advantages with computers. It is now possible to send messages to people all over the world in an instant and to receive a message just as quickly. And many love affairs have begun when people have ""talked"" to each other via the internet. It can have it's advantages to get to know a person's inner qualities before you form your opinions about the outside. Another advantage is that you can receive the latest news in a very short time. And, for example, all sorts of information about schools, museums and cinemas. It is also possible to create your own homepage and in that way people who has got the same interests get together and exchange experiences. 

And last but not least, think about how easy it is to write a letter or an essay or some other document with a computer and it's word processor. And to rewrite these documents. The writingprocess is so much more rewarding when you are able to concentrate on the writing itself. Instead of worrying about details like rewriting by hand.

To sum up this essay I would like to point out that, even though we live in a society that is growing in all kind of ways, we have to adjust the best we can. And to think of the computer as a helping hand makes it all easier. We as human beings are still superior to the machines in many ways.",0
52,0173.a2.txt,Regulate the Swedish import of American films,"The United States has for a long time dominated the world's film production. The number of new American productions is constantly increasing, and many of its actors are well known all over the world. American culture and society has become part of many people's everyday life, in spite of the fact that they live in completely different countries. The youth of Japan might know more about the American school system, than about their own, as a result of the many hours spent in front of Beverly Hills. And if Europeans tend to know a lot about the judicial system, it is more likely about the American judicial system than their own, because of the large number of American successes dealing with laywers, as The Firm and Ally McBeal. In studios all over the world, native actors do their best to imitate the voices of American actors, with the aim to make the movies understandable to their compatriots. In the meanwhile, domestic productions are neglected, and non-american film producers find themselves struggling against a power, which is far too strong to challenge. 
In 1991 a resolution of the Swedish Riksdag regulated the number of American productions in the state's television channels, in order to promote both the domestic and the European film and television industry. The result has been a greater variaty in the programs, and the creation of many high-quality Swedish productions made for television. But for the Swedish film-industry the problem remains intact. The Riksdag resolution should therefore be extended to include this domain as well. A regulation of American movies imported by Swedish cinemas would result in a more fair competition for the filmgoers.
Film as a medium is an effective way to disseminate ideas and knowledge about different cultures. With this as an aim, it is often used in the schools as an alternative to textbooks, giving the students a deeper and more nuanced knowledge than can be recieved only by reading or listening. While watching a foreign movie, the students are given the possibility to get an insight into a different country and its features, as well as into the everyday life of its inhabitants. In this way the film serves to increase the comprehension for other cultures and hopefully promotes a more positive attitude to immigrants and to the cultural diversity of our country. A regulation of the import of foreign movies would imply a reduced number of American films in favour of both Swedish and other non-american movies. This diversity at the cinemas would serve in the same way as in the schools, but reach out to more people.
A regulation of the film-import would also be of great importance to Swedish producers and actors. By now only a few Swedish productions are up at the cinemas, because of the keen competition. Among the small number of films actually shown, many are seen only by a minority. A case in point is the film made by the Swedish producer Lisa Ohlin, Veranda f√∂r en tenor, which was performed for the first time last summer. In spite of great and well known actors, a highly commended script and dazzling reviews, the film was shown only in a few cities and had a surprisingly small audience. This was the result of far too many bad experiences with similar films, which had been neglected by Swedish filmgoers, in order to favour one of the American productions instead. A regulation of the import would stimulate the Swedish film industry and give the native producers the opportunity to reach out to their audience. It would favour the cultural life of Sweden as well as promote more jobs.
In the debate about a proposed regulation it has been claimed that a implementation of the same would conflict with the freedom of competition. It is true that the Swedish film industry then would not compete at the free market, and that a legalisation of regulation would be against the democratic rights. But what is even more dangerous for a small country like Sweden is actually the present situation; a situation where we find ourselves discriminated and brushed aside by a gigantic competitor, which nearly has a monopoly of the world's film production. For the individual the standardization of the present supply is a threat, even though it is a result of free competition and not of some totalitarian state's censorship.
A regulation would serve to give the Swedes a greater possibility to choose on their own what kind of film they want to see. It is the only way to combat the present standardization and to recapture the control over an important domain of Swedish cultural life.",0
53,0174.a2.txt,"Give your children the best start in life, give them your time.","I am of the opinion that there is not many parents that really want their children to be brought up in the arms of the day-nursery, in a big group of children with little space to play and move around, with over-worked staff to inspire them. In other words why do we have children if we do not intend to spend any time with them to build up a good relationship and give the child a solid and hopeful trust in you and a good base to start from when they go out to explore the world. Therefore stay at home and take care of your children, it will give them the best start in life. 

The reason why we have this situation today started under the beginning of the twentieth century when the picture of the ideal family was changed. It was influenced by the so called modernisation project. Experts were consulted to make the families futures perfect, with the main interest that the family in the best way should be able to fit into the industrial worlds expanding production. In that perspective the child was seen as a burden or an impediment for the parents working ability. Due to that the Myrdal couple introduced the social engineering concept in reality. Their concept was that well trained staff, that knew better than the parents how to raise and take care of the growing children, would take care of them when the parents worked. 

Therefore being aware of the social engineerings false message that the best thing for your child is to be taken care of by specialists educated specialy for that purpuse. Is without doubt not true. On the contrary I am convinced that parents are the once that know what is best for their child. The home is the natural place for the child to learn about rules and putting valuations on different things. The ethical and moral foundations that are given in the boundaries of the family is of big importance for the childs continuous progress. In the little group a family consist of, every member gets the opportunity to meet love, thoughtfulness and understanding, but also meet claims and take responsibilities. In this way a family establishes a communion. Owing to all human beings desire to be seen and being a person that is not exchangeable, a person with unique qualities.

Undoubtedly you can see the result of making the state responsible of taking care of the growing generation, in the negative way of disciplinary problems in school today. Nevertheless it seems as parents trust the school and other authorises to take care of the childrens upbringing. Due to the shortage of money in school and the states education politic today it consequently lead to teachers leaving the schools because of a bad working atmosphere. It does not seem as a stable and good base to trust the important support of your childs basic stability. They need a good support from their homes more than ever. The earlier we start the better, all to prevent a falling through the system.

Furthermore extensive investigations clearly indicate that parents wish to decide how their children are going to be brought up during their first important years. For instance the reform that offered parents to have an extra care-subsidy to be able to take care of their children without a big loss of money proved that seventy percent of the families wanted to stay at home. What is more, the reform also pointed out that many parents looked for an alternative to the municipal child-care, some private care there the parents have more influence on how to take care of their children. 

For these reasons I am convinced being in a small group with much time for the individual as in a family is the best start in life. The biggest responsibility for the children is a priviledge that you as a parent not shall resist. According to UN:s convention for children ""the best thing for the child is the most important aspect"". Owing to this we shall not let the strong economical powers, force us to leave our children to the confidence of state management. In other words we must encourage the parents and give them confidence to choose in which way their children are going to be brought up. It is evident that the joy and delight to see your childs progresses is worth every eventual shortage of money. Being aware of that you yourself at the same time are helping them to a better start in life. Just being yourself and be present will build up a mutual respect that will hold your whole life true. I am convinced that your child gets the best start in life at home with you. Owing to the family as an still important unit in society.",0
54,0175.a2.txt,Arguments to take stand against capital punishment,"Before I joined Amnesty International I had a lot of thoughts about the death penalty. I didn't know whether I was for or against the punishment. Now I know for sure that I am against the capital punishment. My conviction is based on three arguments against death penalty: the state can't show that it's wrong to kill by killing, someone that is not guilty can be convicted and death penalty does not act as a deterrent.

I think that everybody can understand that the relatives of the victim want some sort of revenge on the person who might have killed their family member, but I don't think a state can show its citizens that something is wrong to do by doing exactly the same thing but in the name of the law. The Government must think in terms of right and wrong and shouldn't let emotions take over. People that is affected by a loss, on the other hand, aren't able to think clearly. Of course we must understand the feelings those people have but I don't think that the Government should show that they care about their citizens by killing some of them. We have to remember that we can't get someone we love back by killing someone else. I think it's important to stress that people who commit terrible crimes should be punished, but that should be done using other punishments than death penalty for example lifetime punishment.

One argument you often hear from people who are advocating death penalty is that it is much cheaper to execute a criminal than to keep him or her in prison for life. That is not true, though. It has been proved that the trial that precede a death penalty is much more expensive than a lifetime punishment. Even if the trials are very thorough there are still people who are not guilty that get judged. In the USA the majority of the prisoners convicted to death are black men who have lived their lives in poverty. Poor people can't afford the best lawyer and because of that they can be wrongfully convicted. The possibility to kill an innocent person is reason enough to be against death penalty. The Government can't pay back the loss it has caused the innocent person's family. In these cases there is just another victim and no problems has been solved.

People that advocates death penalty maintain that the capital punishment keeps people away from committing crimes. This argument is not true either. In countries where they still have death penalty people commit higher amounts of serious crimes than in countries that don't have this punishment. I think that this fact proves that the capital punishment doesn't work as a deterrent. I think lifetime punishment is much better than death penalty. I advocate lifetime punishment because I don't think a victim or its relatives who might have been harassed by a criminal should fear that it could happen again. I also advocate this kind of punishment because if it appears that the person who is convicted is innocent, he or she will still be alive. Even if you can't pay back for years behind bars, the innocent person can live the rest of his life in freedom which you can't let a dead person do. I think the best thing a society could do is not to scare people away from committing crimes, but to prevent crime. As an example this could be done by developing a better and more equal school system. This is of course very expensive, but if we put an end to capital punishment I think we could afford it. 

It is not always easy to be against death penalty. When you hear about people who rape and kill innocent children it is easy to feel that this person deserves to die. I also think it's quite normal to feel this way, but I still don't think the Government can show us what we do wrong by doing exactly the same thing. There are many more arguments to take a stand against the capital punishment, but for me the three I have presented here are reasons enough to stop this cruel punishment.",0
55,0176.a2.txt,Stub Out!,"The tobacco industry pleases its consumers by producing approx. 5 342 991 000 000 cigarettes for them per day. It is not difficult then to imagine what huge amounts of money this gigantic industry turns into cash on its product. How can that be, I wonder, when smoking is such an unhealthy and expensive thing to do? How long can it continue like this? Is the fact that tobacco companies are taken to court by individuals for having caused people's illness or even death, a sign of that we somewhere in the future will have a non-smoking world? 
In today's society, we are very conscious of what we eat. To keep your body fit and healthy is of great importance for most people. And I think everyone is aware of the risks for diseases related to smoking (both active and passive smoking) and how it affects your health and beauty. In spite of this there is yet a message of smoking as accepted and associated with success and glamour. Children learn from movies and commercials that it is cool to be a smoker. Try smoking is for young people a step into the exciting adult world. And of course the advertisers address to this target group. In Sweden 80 new smokers per day are claimed, to replace those who have given up smoking or even died from it. In the US this number is 5000 per day. 
Then there is the economy aspect of smoking (which is very much connected to the health aspect). It is a very expensive amusement both for the individual and society in large. For me as a non-smoker it seems very unnecessary having to count the expense for something that might contribute to shorten your life, in your personal budget. The causes of smoking that affect society's economy consequently also affect the economy of people in general. Diseases from smoking make people who normally should work, having to be on sickness benefit or even get early retirement pension. In the US many states are bringing actions against tobacco companies to get compensation for damages caused by smoking. The companies then argue that the individual smoker is responsible for his/her decision and should be aware of the consequences of smoking. One can then wonder to what extend the tobacco companies inform their consumers of the risks.
My third and last argument against smoking is the one that feels most important for myself. It is the fact that you involuntary have to spend some time of the day in smoky surroundings almost everyday and often meet a lack of consideration for non-smokers among many smokers. The Swedish tobacco law from 1993, says that smoking is forbidden in all places of work, schools and other public buildings. (To have special ""smoking rooms"" is allowed.) I don't think I have noticed any remarkable difference since this law was introduced, though. The restaurants' and caf√©s' non-smoking areas for example, do not often make any sense since you are still in the same room and the smoke doesn't stay in the ""smokers' area"" just because there is a rule. I want to be able to sit in a caf√© without having to bring the nasty smell from smoke with me home in my clothes and hair. In many public institutions, for example hospitals, the entrances turn into smoking areas with big stinking ashtrays and when going in you get ""welcomed"" by the disgusting smell from fag-ends. 
So, what is it then that makes people smoke despite everything, in my view, speaking against it? Perhaps it is a need, a feeling of being something more with that cigarette in the corner of their mouths or/and a lust that is stronger than the question of health and money. Whatever it is, it is something that I as a non- (and never-) smoker can't understand it and don't think I ever will.",0
56,0177.a2.txt,Segregation in the United States,"Why should people be segregated? What's the purpose of it? I don't understand. All I can see is injustices and problems. At first people were segregated by ""force and laws"", because of the colour of their skin - the blacks got separated from the whites. Fortunately people came to their senses and understood that it was wrong, but nowadays it seems like they're back there again - only this time voluntarily. Still, that doesn't mean that I find it's a good thing. To me, segregation means; racial discrimination, growing cultural and traditional differences, and growing hostility feelings towards each other.

Who can have the right to say, and decide which kind of people that should be separated from the others. Aren't we all human beings with the same kind of flesh and blood? 
It wasn't that many years ago when you could read signs on public transportations, park benches, and other places where it said ""WHITES ONLY"" (just like the Apartheid movement in South Africa). I can't believe that white people actually had the right to put up signs like that - and that they also had the government on their side! I don't think people would care if somebody put up a sign today saying ""DARK-HAIRED ONLY"". But, in fact it is almost the same thing - you are judging people based only on their looks. I think it's awful. 
For a quite long time there were a lot of places and institutions in the United States that were segregated; schools, restaurants, public busses etc. I would say, it was a question of racial discrimination! In other words, if you had black skin, you weren't as good as all the others and you weren't worth as much as the others. How stupid is that?!!
Luckily these racial ideas came to an end with the Civil Rights Movement in the 50s and 60s. Schools became integrated and the black people got the same rights as the whites. But today it seems like the white and the black people are starting to ""avoid"" each other again. There's a lot of pure black neighbourhoods as well as white ones. I know this is (probably) a voluntarily move, but it still makes me mad that the black neighbourhoods always are so much poorer than the white ones. There must be an explanation for that. 
The reason why I'm not too happy about the segregated neighbourhoods is the fact that it's only gonna lead to bigger cultural differences between whites and blacks. Already, the black people has their own way of talking - a sort of a dialect, I guess you can call it. This is all OK till a certain limit, I think. There is a big chance that the black people get so isolated from the rest of the ""world"" (by that I mean the white people and the other minority groups in the United States), that after a while it might be too late to get the two groups get along with each other. This can cause hostile feelings between the two groups if somebody, let's say a white person, ""trespasses"" on a black neighbourhood. I'm afraid that person will not feel very welcome there. A good example from this is in New York city's Harlem. I've been to Harlem myself, and I received a lot of strange looks from the people on the streets. At first, the cab driver wouldn't even drive me there - I had to persuade him it was OK. (He didn't take me to the place I wanted to see though; he dropped me off about ten blocks away - afraid to go any further). My point is; if certain neighbourhoods will continue to be segregated, there's gonna be less places where you can go safe - for everybody.

Of course I can't judge or blame the black people (some of - not all) for not wanting to be around the whites. They probably have bad memories and/or experiences with white people from the past or present - the blacks have almost always been discriminated by the whites. But still, I don't think they will solve any problems by avoiding each other. The problems might just get bigger and bigger...Who knows? 
Instead, wouldn't the world be a better place to live in, if all people could get along with each other and don't care about what one or another looks like? We're all human beings.",0
57,0178.a2.txt,Watching television is not dangerous,"Recent tragic events involving children's' violent behaviour, such as the death of four-year-old Kevin caused by other children about his age, have once again brought attention to the question whether television is a probable cause to violence or not. Animated cartoons and various types of action movies are blamed for scaring children and increasing violent behaviour among them. It is argued that children not being able to draw a distinction between fiction and reality might copy violence seen on the screen, being unaware of the actual consequences in real life. Many parents I have spoken to are of the opinion that television indeed affects children in a negative way, and some of them have simply prohibited their children from watching it. I strongly object to all these views, believing television is extremely valuable and should not be restricted to adults only. To blame television for some children's' violent behaviour is, in my opinion, neither fair nor correct.
Needless to deny, many television programs do contain violence, and I understand some parents concerns. It should be pointed out, however, that there are different categories of violence, some more a subject to concerns than others.
 A major worry to parents is the violence in animated cartoons, a worry I argue being unnecessary. Children watching these cartoons are very much aware of what is real and what is not. Cartoons are so obviously unrealistic and children very seldom consider them being frightening. Furthermore, it is even more unlikely that children would copy any of the absurd actions carried out by these fantasy creatures of all shapes and forms.
 Compared to animated brutality, violence seen in action movies is of another character though. But even if this type is far from as exaggerated as in cartoons, and therefore closer to reality, children of today have great knowledge about filmmaking and accept explanations given about special effects, make-up and artificial blood.

Whether children identify with characters seen on the screen and the fear of that they might act like these in real life, should not be a major subject to worry either. Naturally children might, and often do, imitate some characters while they are playing, but this identification is not of a more serious kind. It should not be confused with an actual belief to be a character. When children imitate their favourite super- or action heroes, they know perfectly well that it is only a game, and even though children's games sometimes seem violent to an observer, there is no deliberate wish to hurt a playmate. Pretending to shoot a friend while playing has nothing to do with actually wanting him dead or hurt in reality, on the contrary; if someone by accident gets hurt while playing, the game almost always comes to its end. If the former played conflict becomes a real one, children immediately call each other by real names again, leaving the pretended characters and the game. Other factors rather than television therefore most often cause real conflicts between children, as the latter inspire to pretended conflicts, not real ones.
Far trickier is it to determine the effect on children that real violence on the screen has, such as it seen on the news. This is the violence parents should be concerned about, as it can not be explained as unrealistic or fake. I believe this is the kind children might find frightening, realising how awful adults are treating each other for real. I do not see, however, any reason for parents to turn off the television when the newscast begins. Younger children are usually not interested in adult programs like this, they learn early to recognise a ""boring adult program"" that lack funny voices, bright colours and happy music. Would an older child show interest in watching the news with his/ her parents, however, I see no reason at all to object. Apart from being wonderful, the reality we are living in is also very cruel, and I argue it being wrong to pretend otherwise.

 All misery should naturally not be forced on a young person too early and abrupt, but it is important that parents try to answer whatever questions a child might have without glamorise reality too much.
On the whole, television is a fantastic source from which fantasy is created, playfulness is inspired and experience is made. Children can both learn and be part of incredible adventures by watching it, and I argue that this opportunity should not be kept out of reach. Children are capable of handling television to much greater extent than some adults think, and are in addition to that very critical to what they watch. Any normal child, raised with certain values, has natural limits, which are not to be overstepped. Violent behaviour is the result of many factors other than television alone. What we should be focusing some attention to is in what way our children watch it though. Children should always have the opportunity to ask an adult about things being unclear or scary. Television should be watched together, not alone, and should never be used as a babysitter. Having a healthy relation to it, not spending too many hours of our time on it, television is by no means dangerous, but quite good- for adults as well as children.",0
58,0179.a2.txt,The choice of geriactic care,"In Sweden we have chosen to have old-aged care and institutions that look after elderly often ill people. But there have not always been like this. We can go back to the beginning of the 20th century when we had a large rural population in Sweden. People lived close together in families consisting of three generations and the family took care of their members from birth to death. When people grew old they were depending on their relatives' goodness. There were very few institutions, only poorhouses for elderly and poor people who had no relatives. In the middle of the century when people began to move into towns to work for their living, a need of institutions for elderly people rose. Families often moved to apartments where there were no place for the elderly generation to come with them. The elderly were left back home, and when they could not manage by themselves they must move to institutions. Today old people can choose if they want to live at home with help from the geriactic care or in an institution. Care of the elderly are in our days questioned because of different alarming reports of bad conditions in institutions and shortage of money. Would it therefor be better to go back to the old days when the family had the responsibility for their old relatives? I will try to argue against it because we are all going to need some sort of care in the future more or less.

Geriactic care takes a great deal of tax money but old people have to pay a fee based on their income for receiving it. That makes the conditions more equal and you do not have to depend on whether you or your relatives can afford it. Most old people want to feel independent of their children's help and will not be a burden. They know that their children do not have time to look after them because they work all day and have families of their own. The children can also live far away and that can make it hard to visit regularly. In Sweden people often achieve a high length of life and therefor can children be old and retired and also have parents in life that they cannot take care of. Even old people without a family must be able to be helped when they need to and there the only alternative will be the geriactic care.

The geriactic care has predominat women employees and it is a large part of the public sector. If we shut down the geriactic care many women would be unemployed and we would loose a lot of tax money. Many women would feel forced to go back home and to take care of children and old relatives without any pay. The family looses an income and would need social security benefit because you cannot support a family on one income. There would be heavy expenses for the social welfare with less tax income and more social benefits. One way of handle the situation could be to give a geriatric-care benefit when the family takes care of their elderly. That would probably not recompense for one income and it would be to expensive for the social insurance. Many women would not like to be tied down at home when they have been used to work and earn their own money. Today, women want to have their freedom and I cannot believe that there will be men who would take care of their old relatives. 

We cannot go back to the old days when the family was responsible for the social security in our country. Nowadays there are so many different sort of families. Divorces make new constellations of the family and new relatives. People move and do not live next to their relatives as they use to do in the beginning of this century. These are difficulties that you have to consider whether to have geriactic care or not. Geriactic care gives elderly people and their children a choice if they want to be dependent or not on each other. If you don't get along very well you can",0
59,0180.a2.txt,Who is to take care of your children?,"When the days of maternity leave are racing towards an end it is time to make up your mind. Who is to look after your child now? There are plenty alternatives: you could for example choose to continue staying at home or, if you are dying to get back to work, maybe start off with part time? Other options are day care centres or child minders. The decision might not be as easy as you first thought. In this short arguing essay I am going to deal with the different matters of child minding with the main question: Stay at home with your child or use day care centres. 

Of course there are not always as easy as to only make up your mind. Maybe you have only got one or two options due to the supply or the standards of day care in your area of living. Maybe you have relatives or friends who are willing to help you out or maybe it is as simple as this: you do not have any work to go back to. There are as a matter of fact innumerable ways to solve this problem. As I cannot deal with them all here and now I will return to my main question at issue: day care or house wife (man). To me the answer seems clear but I will try to give you some of my arguments.

At a day care centre (which by the way sounds much more institutional than the Swedish word ""dagis"") the child will automatically learn to manage without ""mummy and daddy"" but still look forward to being picked up by the end of the day. It is more fun to come home and find your own toys and books after a day away from home. At day care the matters of sharing things and playing together with other children comes naturally and, from my point of view, this makes the child more outgoing and open minded. This, as well as the fact that the child gets used to trusting other adults, are very strong pro-day care arguments.

Even though there are no doubts as to my own opinion I can understand people who argue staying at home with your child is the only right thing. I can understand their views but I do not fully agree. One might not think it is fair to a small child leaving her in someone else's care, away from home. The home is a protected and secure place for a child, yes, but what happens when one day it is time to go to school and mummy will no longer be there? Is that fair to your child? 

Another point is that if you stay at home with your child you will get a better understanding and contact with her, being able to follow her every move and achievement. I agree but only because you do not see your little ones for seven hours it does not mean you are missing out on their childhood or that you are being a bad parent. You still have lots of time to spend with your child.

When it comes to seeing other children one might argue a mother (or father of course) can attend lots of activities with the child were other children are included and in that way introduce ""playmates"" to the child. It is not the same thing though, as learning to deal with friends and not-so-good-friends on your own in day care centres. That brings up another good thing about day care; they also do lot of activities such as going to swimming pools, theatres or simply different playgrounds. How fun for the children and how easy for you!

Of course nobody should choose day care only because it is easy. You have to feel confident about someone else taking care of your precious child and you must not have bad conscience when you finally have made your mind up. Fortunately different solutions suit different people and we all have to accept that. You never know what will happen in the future but I might become a proud house wife. I just want to kill the myth about mothers being obliged to stay at home nursing children in stead of making a career. You do not have to make the choice between your children and your work, not with the exceptional day care facilities we have in Sweden today. It might sound like day care is ""the hard way""; to find friends, taking turns, not getting all the attention but being one in the group and getting the help needed. The hard way so is it, but it will all come to use for the child in the future and in the end your child will be happier and more open.",0
60,0182.a2.txt,Sweden should leave the European Union,"My intention with this short essay is to as far as possible make clear some of the mistakes that were made by Swedish authorities and politicians when Sweden entered the EU in 1995. There are many things to mention for or against our membership in the EU, but the main issue in this essay will be about the Swedish food industry and agriculture. As these were some of the most important topics discussed before the referendum in 1994. 

Mrs Marit Paulsson, also known as the mother of Sweden gave such promises and blessings about the protection of Swedish food and agriculture that at the end of the debate just before the day of the referendum people voted yes to EU. Without the confidence that many Swedes had in Mrs Paulsson, the result of the referendum would have turned out as no to the EU. However things went wrong already from the beginning that is, when the Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson finally signed the document that made Sweden a member of the EU, he did it in blank. This meant that the only demand Sweden had to express before joining the EU, was to keep the restrictive law against free sale of alcohol. As a consequence of that no decisions were taken about how to finance the transition for Swedish farmers and food manufactures into the legislation of EU. Consequently, this meant that the whole food industry was left to its destiny without any kind of economic help. Since the bureaucratic regulations of EU are very strict and must be obeyed, thousands of farmers, food companies and retailers had to close down their business because they could not afford to rebuild their barns and companies into a EU-standard as was demanded by Swedish authorities.

Still today as many as five peasants a day have to close down their business in lack of financial resources. However in Finland the government and the parliament claimed that the EU should pay all expenses for rebuilding their food industry in an adjustment to the standard regulations of EU, which the EU also did after hard negotiations. In addition it must be pointed out that in no other European country have the authorities demanded food industry and the peasants to make such big changes inside their companies as has been done in Sweden. Despite the grants-in-aid some farmers get from the EU is their present situation much worse than it was before the entrance into the EU.

The monopolisation of the Swedish food industry has grown strongly since we participated the European Union. This has gone on in a sharp contrast to what was said before the referendum. Instead of getting a freer market for the Swedish peasants which was predicted by Marit Paulsson in particular. We now have to witness the beginning of a system similar to that of the previous political, bureaucratic and inefficient agricultural system of the former Soviet Union. This is a system that hardly none of us really would want to have. Although, this is what EU is all about, an immense bureaucratic apparatus whose only function nowadays is to support a lot of bureaucrats. Furthermore many of them are completely corrupt. 

Before our entrance into the European Union, I run a small but successful business in close relationship with two other companies from the same trade. We were in the business of importing and selling Grouse and Reindeer from Russia and China. Unfortunately, the EU bureaucrats did not allow us to continue with this import from a land outside the EU we therefore had to close down our companies in lack of wares to sell. As a result of this, a few wealthy food companies started to buy most of the smaller companies which could not afford to stay in business.

We now have a very serious problem with a monopolised food industry. Consequently this means that there is not much of control left for quality and from what country the meat comes from originally. This means that in future when most production of Swedish meat has disappeared from the market, there will be huge quantities of foreign uncontrolled meat passing the Swedish border every day. Furthermore, there will be no way we can manage to control hormone treatment and diseases that can have affected the animals before they were slaughtered. The mere suspicion about how these animals are treated should be enough reason for Sweden to leave the EU. But, if we think it is not worth protecting our many years long tradition of healthy food and a beautiful agricultural countryside and if we think it is worth paying twenty-five billion kronor each year to the EU and get so little in return, then we should continue to be a member of the European Union.

Of course there are some advantages of being a part of a European Assembly like the EU. We now have a free and open market for education, trade and no tolls between the membership-countries as we had earlier. Nowadays it is also possible for people to move around and work within the EU countries without any bigger problems, something that many young people today choose to do. The European Union is also an important organisation for keeping peace in Europe which also was its intention from the very beginning. The first steps were taken towards the organisation as we can see it today when Ministers of France and Germany met to discuss a peace treaty in Paris in 1947. Moreover, Swedish Parliament have been able to cut our defence cost heavily since 1995 due to our closer relationship with NATO. We now know that NATO most likely would help us in a critical situation. 

As a conclusion of what has been said I should want to give some further comments to this essay. As has already been mentioned about food quality and hard terms for the peasants. It must also be emphasised that we still should consider ourselves as a independent nation. But, what will be left of our independence when all important decisions about our future will be taken by powerful bureaucrats in Brussels. My personal opinion is that we never should have had such a hurry in applying for a membership to the EU. If we had been wise like the Norwegians were, then we would have waited with our application. We were simply not prepared to meet all the forthcoming changes, nor were we enough stable seen from a economically point of view. As the situation now appears we can only hope that our future prospects in the European Union are going to look better.",0
61,0185.a2.txt,Stop animal experimentation!,"Much have been said about animal experimentation and if it is right or not.

Maybe in some areas, but not really to the extent were you can say that animal experimentation is absolutely essential for science. But that is not the main reason why we should put an end to animal testing. There are many reasons, and I will present some of them below.
To begin with, we have the religious aspect to consider. People in general hopefully feel some kind of responsibility towards other human beings. But in the Bible, God says that man has a responsibility to everything on Earth. That of course includes animals. We should take care of all living creatures on this planet, instead of extinct rare species for economic reasons. The extinction of the white tiger and the rhino is two examples of this. Once a species has disappeared, it will never return. Some might say that we should benefit from the animals and take whatever they can bring us, including the answers they can produce in testing. But if we have a responsibility, we should know better.
If we, the humans, can claim that we are the superior race on this planet, we should also realise that being superior is the same as having the responsibility. When we know that, and treat the animals with respect, we would feel better about ourselves. We could go to sleep at night and feel that we indeed have shown respect to every living creature among us. Everyone wants to feel good and have a clear conscience. This should be a very good reason to stop animal experimentation.
If this reason is not enough, and people still wonder why this experimentation should be stopped, I would like to point out that animals feel emotions not unlike our own. Of course this is not the common opinion, but ask anyone who has a pet at home. This person would probably tell you that his or her dog doesn't like this or that, or that his cat was unhappy when it was left alone one day, or something else. Our pets love us, and we love them. Why should it be different with the animals in the laboratories, can it be true that these animals cannot feel as well? It is without a shadow of a doubt that I can say that animals do have feelings, they can feel joy and pain just as we can. Still we torture them with cosmetics in their eyes and we inject them with poisonous substances. It is claimed that this is for the good of the humans. But do we feel better? Is it worth it? People who don't agree to these questions buy products that are not tested on animals. This group of people is getting larger every day. This should tell us something. More people are buying products that are not affecting our environment badly, so if the environment is important to us, the creatures living in it should be just as important.
Some objects to the animal experimentation in the cosmetic business, but not the scientific. The scientific experimentation on animals could help us find the cure for some terrible disease, cancer or aids for example. The animals' lives are not as important as human lives. But that is still not a good reason, and this is because the testing on animals is not essential. There are many ways of finding a cure or conclusion to scientific problems, without using animals. Then why don't they use these ways of testing? Sadly enough, the answer to that question is money. It is much cheaper to use animals than to do experimentation in other ways. On top of that, the people who perform the experiments don't care if the animals are suffering.
If we all think about what we appreciate in life, we probably think of goodness and love. The only thing I want to point out is that this goodness and love should concern all living beings. And as humans, we are all responsible for what goes on in our world. Take a look around. Have we done well so far? It's time we take this responsibility seriously, and stop the unnecessary animal experimentation.",0
62,0186.a2.txt,Nature Vs The human being,"Nature gives us many wonderful things like trees, flowers and fresh air. All this to make us feel good and to have a beautiful environment. And how do we, people, repay? Apparently by throwing rubbish, that takes several years to break down, on the ground and by polluting the air, since I lately have been feeling that I have to wade my way through piles of litter on my way to school. Today's people seem totally to have lost respect for nature. Nobody any longer seems to care whether our planet is going to look like a rubbish-heap or not. I also cannot understand why some people appear to have this urge to destroy everything that is beautiful. 
First of all, not many things make me angry, but I get furious when I see people who throw aluminiumcans or plastic bags on the ground and then just walk away like nothing has happened. But something has happened. Why cannot these people see what they are doing, meaning, why do they not understand that they have taken this world yet another step closer of total destruction? But anger is not the only sort of emotion this kind of behaviour awakens in me; I also feel sadness and despair. Sadness, for I realize that few people care for the well being of our beautiful planet and despair because there is nothing I can do about it. During this last century we, that is human beings, have done more harm to our planet than during all thousands of years before the 20th century.
So why do people continue behaving like this? One argument is that there are not enough litterbins around. But, I do not see that as a good excuse. What you can do is simply to put the rubbish in your bag or pocket and throw it either when you find a litterbin or when you arrive at home. What is even more alarming is when people, while travelling, throw their plastic bags from the car window after finishing their meals. Absolutely nothing justifies that sort of behaviour, if the leftovers smell bad, put them in the trunk instead. 
What is it that makes us so irresponsible and lazy? Do we really think that the aluminiumcans or plastic bags are going to disappear by themselves? Or do we even expect someone else to pick it up? I think that the problem is that we simply have stopped reflecting on such things. We no longer have bad conscience about throwing litter on the ground and some people might not even be aware of what they are doing, meaning that human beings do not care what happens to the earth anymore.
Second, when you see people behaving like this you are, however, not surprised when you hear about littering on an even larger scale, that is, for example dumping. People, with power in executive positions, dump tons of poisonous barrels into our oceans and seas with only one argument, namely: What cannot be seen is not going to hurt anyone. Money, even if these people are reluctant to admit such a thing, is what really makes them to do idiotic things like that. Money, not for the whole world to benefit from, but for themselves. This short-term thinking affects our whole planet and there must be other options.
Finally, I also do not understand why the human being keeps seeing itself as superior to every other form of life? What allows us to treat nature, animals and the air we breathe this way? Absolutely nothing. We are only making things worse for ourselves. One day there will no longer be any beautiful flowers or trees to look at, we will have exterminated many kinds of animals and there will no longer exist such a thing as fresh air. What will we do then? Not much, because it will be too late to do anything. It is today that we have to wake up and react. We must start to care of our local environment and stop throwing cigarette ends and aluminiumcans, even if it sounds like minor faults compared to dumping, on the ground. 
We only have one chance, so we better start saving our planet now.",0
63,0187.a2.txt,"In Sweden we have a great historical heritage of monarchs that dates back over a thousand years. Many were powerful and influential, some of which gained a high international status and successfully enlarged the Swedish kingdom. I see no reason for ending that long tradition of monarchs now. Karl XVI Gustav is a national symbol and will remain as one for the rest of his life and will then pass on his title to his daughter Victoria. It is a comfort to know what will happen to the royal family and that something will stay the same in Sweden while so many other things change. There will not be the same thing with a President, who will not be the same person for a longer period of time. It will always be an uncertianty about how he will manage his job as representative of Sweden. Some Presidents will probably perform this task in an admirable way, but some will manage less good. The ones who are not good at representative tasks will in a way make Sweden look bad outwards. Therefore it is better to rely on a professional in this area, that is our king, who has had this as a job all his adult life and obtained a lot of experience and is used to be in the centre of attention. The Swedish royal family has a lot of contacts abroad, mainly with other royal families, which can come in handy in times of crises and they might then be able to turn to other countries for assistance.","The main argument for dissolving the monarchy is that it costs a lot of money which is paid by the people through taxes. They argue that our money should be used to something more useful than to give money to the already rich. What they do not think about is that if we don't have a monarch as head of state, there will be another head of state who has to do the same rate of representation of the country which will cost the tax-payers as much money. The royal family does not use the appanage for their own private needs or luxuries, which is paid for by their private wealth, but rather to finance their representative work. The royal appanage has also decreased during the past few years. 
I think our King and Queen are doing a splendid job as representatives of Sweden. They are popular with most Swedes because they are down-to-earth and takes their task seriously instead of living the jet-set life they could do. If we should have a President as head of state the representative part of the presidency would be a disturbing factor in his political work. In that case it is better to have, as Sweden has, a Prime Minister in a monarchy who can concentrate only on politics and solely be a part of the actual governing of the country and let the King or Queen deal with the representative tasks. 
The royal couple are not totally unaware of what is happening throughout the nation. They often attend inaugurations and various events where they show their support for the different local areas. It happens that they visit different places of work where they talk to the people working there in an everyday way. The Queen is also very engaged in charity work, especially helping children who have difficulties of different kinds. 
One can argue that if the King and Queen are doing a bad job you cannot replace them by choosing another monarch, but today a monarch can only do things within a certain limit. He has advisers who will put an end to extreme behaviour. The monarch has no real power anylonger, so he cannot make decisions that will affect many others. 
I do not see any strong reasons for replacing our monarch who is doing a fine work as our head of state and makes a great national symbol for the rest of the world to see.",0
64,0188.a2.txt,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT: Judicial murder,"This essay deals with a very controversial subject; capital punishment. I will argue against this ""cruel and unusual form of punishment"" ( the Constitution of the United States of America). Because of the fact that this is a very complex issue, I have chosen to discuss only the most important aspects of this matter.

"" It is curious, but till that moment I had never realised what it means to destroy a healthy, conscious man. When I saw the prisoner step aside to avoid the puddle I saw the mystery, the unspeakable wrongness, of cutting a life short when it is in full tide. This man was not dying, he was alive just as we are alive.(...( In two minutes, with a sudden snap, one of us would be gone - one mind less, one world less.""
George Orwell: ""A hanging"", Adelphi, 1931

The history of the death penalty speaks for itself in a way. In the 18th century, this was a spectacular event that took place in the town's square. Parents brought their children to see the criminal die. In the 19th century the prisoners were executed within the walls of the prison, with only a few witnesses, and today the executions are taking place inside the prisons with very few witnesses, and as secretly as possible. This change has occurred mainly because it is now established that capital punishment does not have an exemplary effect, and also because this is too cruel and horrible to show in public.
During the 20th century more than one hundred million people have been killed by another person. This means that the human ability to kill has passed epidemics and natural disasters when it comes to extinguishing mankind. To me there is in principle no possibility of justifying capital punishment. There is something so cruel about the kind of death involved that it rules out any possibility of justification.

My main reason for not accepting this form of ""judicial murder"" is moral. There is never morally justifiable to kill another person. One of the most basic Human Rights is the Right to Life. To me no man or woman can take upon themselves the role of God, to wipe out someone else's life. Who is that person (or group of people) who think that they have the right to decide that someone has to die? How do these people make sure that they do not make the wrong decision in some way? What if the person on trial is innocent?

Between the years of 1900 and 1985 350 innocent convicted prisoners were in ""Death Row"" in the United States of America. 23 of these innocent people were executed before they could be released. As long as such horrible mistakes can be made, justice should not allow capital punishment. To execute someone is irrevocable and, since we can not say for sure that someone is guilty, we can not risk that one more innocent could die.

I believe that Society today is to blame for the increasing rate of violent crimes, but I also think that what we make wrong we have to correct. Nobody is a natural born killer, because a killer is a product of an unhappy childhood, possibly a scattered family, and a very disturbed mind. Of course this person has committed a horrific crime and there are no excuses for this, but maybe we can find an explanation in this person's past, and in Society as well.

People murdering and committing other violent crimes are people with a mental disease, and as long as people like this will continue to exist, it is everyone's fault that things does not get better. We all have a responsibility for eachother. Everyone should feel guilty when a murder is committed, because something is wrong with our world, and who can fix it if we can not?

Capital punishment is not going to make things better in any way. To violate the basic Human Rights in the way the death penalty does, will only make way for more violence. Capital punishment is a kind of legalised murder, and if the authorities in a country allow this, they might as well legalize murder on the street as well. Two mistakes do not correct one of them.

This is a problem we all have to deal with, and we all have to take our responsibility to find a better solution than murder.",0
65,0189.a2.txt,About LEGALIZING ABORTIONS,"In this essay I will deal with the issue if abortion should be legal or not. Abortion is a big issue today. A lot of women get involuntarily pregnant. Every day almost a hundred abortions is made in the Swedish hospitals and every fourth pregnancy is terminated by an abortion. Although it is legal in Sweden it is not legal in all countries, and there are a lot of different opinions about whether it should be legal or not and why. Some people think that abortion is the same as murder and that it definitely should be illegal, and some people, like myself, think that it has to be legal. Why I think so is what I want to show you in this essay.
In 1975 abortions became legal in Sweden. The Law about abortion admit free abortion until the eighteenth week. If a woman wants to have one later than that she has to get a permission from the National Board of Health and Welfare. Sweden has, however, a low number of abortions in comparison with Catholic countries, where contraceptives are forbidden. In many parts of the world abortion is illegal, like in Latin America. That often leads to an extremely high number of illegal abortions that are dangerous for the women. In fact, the most common cause of death for women under twenty-five in Latin America is the complications after an illegal abortion.
Important questions to consider before legalizing abortions are: ""When does life begin?"" and ""When is the embryo an actual human with human rights?"". The scientists have different answers to these questions, and I think that it is up to each individual to have his or her own opinion about it. I think, like many anti-abortionists, that life begins with the fertilization, but I do not think that the fetus is a human with human rights until it has left the mother's body. Even when the child is born its rights have to be protected by the parents, because it is not able to make its own decisions. When a child is put up for adoption, it is always the choice of the parents or of the National Board of Health and Welfare, and they are supposed to act in the best interest of the child. I think that this should be the case with abortions to, because sometimes it can be in the best interest of the child not to be born at all; for example if the mother is a drug-addict, has HIV, is too young, has a mental disease or has been raped. Of course there must be strict regulations and strict control of the reasons for an abortion, and my suggestion is that the National Board of Health and Welfare in each country appoints some kind of ""ethnic committee"", that investigate and decides in all cases of abortion.
This strict control is even more important now with the new development in the fetal diagnosis area. The new technology gives us the possibility to see exactly how our children are going to look like, and if they are going to be normal and healthy, but it is also dangerous for countries that have free abortion, because parents could then choose not to have a child just because they know that it is going to be handicapped in some way. It is, however, very hard to draw the line where a handicap is a reason for an abortion or not. I think that as long as a handicap or a sickness does not threaten the life of the child it is not a reason for an abortion. This will be a typical question for the ""ethnic committee"" to decide, and in some extent for the doctor, since he must decide if a life is in danger. My suggestion is that the ""ethnic committee"" create a law that says that fetal diagnosis is illegal until the week when free abortion not is an option anymore (in week eighteen in Sweden, for example), then it is up to the doctor if he thinks that it is necessary to use fetal diagnosis and perhaps operate on the fetal inside the mother or even remove it.
All these new possibilities make free abortion, in the form we have it now impossible in the future. But, I still think that a woman should have the right to have an abortion, if it is in the best interest of the child. The rules and regulations about this just have to be more specific and more complicated, but I believe that if we want to see a good solution to this problem we can find it, and then make abortions legal all over the world under controlled forms.",0
66,0190.a2.txt,Watchfulness Will Avoid Children Falling Into the Hands of Paedophiles.,"Last week we could read about ten children, from three to eleven years old, who had been sexually abused by a 22-year-old man. I guess that we all reacted negatively and felt powerless. How could this happen? Many adults were nearby this catastrophe, but none of them reported it to the police. They claimed that they didn't know it was happening. Perhaps they didn't want to know. There were neighbours who had suspicions, they heard screams from the five-year-old boy, the paedophile's steph-son, but they just rang at the door. If a neighbour reacts on a child's scream, that he or she must ring at the door, then the scream is not a normal scream. They also observed that the paedophile always had the curtains drawn and that the little boy was never out playing with the other children. 
We've been aware of paedophiles before this case. Nobody wants them to destroy more lives than they have already done. If we have children ourselves, it feels very unpleasant to leave them at the nursery every morning. As adult, and fellow-being, I think it is important to react and be aware of this problem and not close our eyes and believe in fairy-tales. We live in the real world, and things aren't always so decent. 
If we see something that possibly can be about sexually abused children, we ought to report it at once, before it is too late, before it has hurt the child completely, for life. Even if we have slight evidence, or none, even if we only got some suspicions, I think it is our obligation to report it to the police. It is our resposibility, as adults, to stop a possible paedophile for the child's sake, for its best. We can never report it to early, but unfortunately, we can report it too late. So, for the child's best: observe, and don't be afraid of interfering (which we Swedish people usually have difficulties with). 
If we report someone because we have our suspicions and it turns out that this reported man or woman is innocent, he or she would presumably feel offended. But, I want to claim this once again, if the whole matter is not reported at all, a life of a child can be totally ruined, and that is not easy to repair, if it can be repaired at all. 
The second argument of reporting to the police in the above matter, is that the person who reported it should feel better, and be proud of him- or herself, that he or she took the initiative instead of the opposite: being quiet and let the whole thing go on. Of course we all want to help, don't we. I wonder, how do the neighbours feel today, those who didn't report it even if they knew that they should have done it. 
The third argument is that if we all are more aware, and awake, and dare to report, the paedophiles would hopefully feel more watched and observed, and know that we are concerned about our children's security. It should be a warning effect with people's engagement and that could frighten the paedophiles. If we don't report cases with paedophiles involved, then they can do whatever they want to do, because then they think that we don't care, that we are afraid of knowing the truth. Of course we don't want to know what a paedophile can do with our children, of course we can't see at a person that he or she is a paedophile, but we can be more vigilant. 
Children do trust in us adults, and we must let them continue trusting us. Be watchful and talk to your children, ask them, tell them, inform them. If they know that we are open-minded, that we can report sick people, then they probably will tell us if there is a paedophile in the nearby.",0
67,0191.a2.txt,Keep the monopoly of Systembolaget,"Systembolaget has had a monopoly of selling wine and liquor in Sweden since 1917. In other words, people have for over eighty years now gone to Systembolaget and bought alcoholic beverages. There has been a debate about whether we should abandon the monopoly of Systembolaget and let the food stores sell wine and liquor. This debate has been especially active since Sweden joined the European Union. But I still strongly think that we should keep the monopoly of Systembolaget. I like for us to continue with the tradition of going to Systembolaget if we want to by a bottle of wine or some other liquor. 

To begin with I think it is useful to have a look at the traditions of drinking alcohol in Sweden. Generally I think that we have got a tradition of only drinking alcohol in the weekends, but then we consume even more alcohol. That is in contrast with the French people who have got their tradition of having wine as a natural drink to a meal. When I worked in England as an au-pair I quite often went to the pub with my friends. I rarely saw any extremely drunk English people there. They seem to have a tradition of seeing friends at the pub instead of at home. It is a more natural thing for them to have just one or two beers or a cup of coffee and then go home. When I saw persons who were very drunk they were actually often Swedish tourists. What I mean is that sometimes people in other countries seems to have a more wholesome relationship towards alcohol than we have. Because of our tradition of drinking I think it is important that there is a limitation in how easy we can buy alcoholic beverages in Sweden. 

Undoubtedly this restriction is especially good for those who have serious problems regarding to alcohol, the alcoholics and others who drink alcohol in a destructive way. If we started to sell wine and liquor in ordinary food stores I think people in general would consume more alcohol. Consequently there would be larger social costs for the society. 

Because I see several problems that I think would appear as a consequence of abandoning the monopoly of Systembolaget. That is an increase of violence among people and more social maladjustment which gives larger unemployment. In addition another aspect on the issue is that youngsters would come in contact with alcohol in an earlier stage in there lives if liquor were sold in their nearest food store. Certainly there would be an age limit to buy alcohol as there is today, but it would anyway be much easier for young people, under the age limit, to get hold of alcohol. Their older friends can for example peddle liquors for them. Moreover I have a feeling that food stores would be less careful than Systembolaget in checking the identification of the young people much because of the profit thinking of the food stores.To sum up this I am of the opinion that since alcohol could be a terrible drug if we use it in the wrong way, that is to say in a way which can hurt people that are close to us, we ought to keep the monopoly of Systembolaget. Unfortunately we have a problem with liquor that are imported illegally in to Sweden. In an attempt to control the smuggled liquor the government tries to make the goods of the Systembolaget more accessible. They are considering to have Systembolaget open on Saturdays and to have Systembolag within food stores and also to improve the service. This new proposal from the government comes in the end of May this year. I think that this sounds like a relatively good proposal but I am indeed very sceptical to having Systembolaget open on Saturdays. All it takes for people is some planning, when and where they are going to make their purchase.

Finally I would like to emphasize that in order to change our tradition of drinking alcohol, I think we should talk more about the subject in the schools. I think it is important to try to change the attitude towards alcohol that I think many young people of today have. I think that more information should be given to teenagers in schools about what alcohol can do to us if we use it the wrong way. Because I think if we want to change a tradition we must start with the younger generation. My very determined opinion is that we are not ready to abandon the monopoly of Systembolaget. It would in general make the health of the citizens of Sweden worse since I think that the consumption of alcohol would increase explosively. So let us continue to go to Systembolaget if we want to enjoy the pleasure of a glass of red wine to our Friday dinner.",0
68,0192.a2.txt,Let the girls talk,"If you see a crowd with both boys and girls there are almost only the boys who are shouting at each other. It is also the boys who are laughing highly and loudly and do gestures widely. While the girls stands beside, just watching. But of course they are talking to each other as well but it is the boys who acts as the centre-figures. Some people think it is genetic that boys are more loquacious than girls while girls on the other hand are more sensitive, and emotional. I agree that we (men and women) are different in many ways and one could say that it depends on genetic results but I have also the strong feeling that this problem is built up by humanbeings decades back. I think one important issue in school today would be to encourage girls to stand up for their own beliefs and make their voices to be heard. This could be a step in the right direction towards equality among men and women. The equality of which the importance we are well aware about in the society of today. I think it has to start already in school. Otherwise there is a big risk for the boys to get indoctrinated that this lap between men and women is just as it should be. If the boys ever notices the lap at all. 

According to a study concerning this problem with silent girls (the book Goodmorning boys and girls by Jan Einarsson and Tor G Hultman) in which there is shown how the time is spent between teachers, boys and girls in school. The writers of the book says that the teacher talks about 2/3 of the time available in a class lection. The remain time approximately 1/3 of which the boys are talking 2/3 and the girls takes what's left. Actually only 1/9 of time is ""offered"" for the girls. The speak activity is also very unequal distributed between boys and girls. There is almost the same boys and the same few girls who takes speech in class. A couple of the girls doesn't say anything at all. That is a pattern what is reflected in grown-up life but as we can see it is borned during these early years. I think this problem is something for us adults to deal with. Parents, teachers, politicians, everybody have to be aware of this urgent problem and take it seriously if a change is going to come. To eliminate this discrimination against girls between the sexes.

Another important clue to connect with this dilemma is when the teacher asks questions. In some way for any reason, to refer to the book I mentioned earlier, it is the boys who gets following questions after the question that was asked. It isn't very often it happens that the girls gets any following questions and that probably doesn't make them more open-wide either. Development demands training and that's also what excpects from school.

To help the girls to get more of the boys self-confidence in school could be to let them talk much more than they do. Let the girls understand that their thoughts and knowledge are just as important as the boys probably seems to be for them. I'm aware of the fact that it is an procedure of patience to go through with this but I am convinced that it is definately worth the time it takes. 

If you did a summery of these factors I have told you about concerning how boys and especially the girls are acting in school. Unfortunately the girls are the subject of an expectating behavior from society. To remain as the well-mannered, nice presency being girls. What would be needed is an awakening within the common people to leed the thoughts into act. There is an obvious direction towards what the girls will meet in common society when they grow up. The clearly segregation and differences between the two sexes. I am certain that in most places of work the majority of the men are in higher salary than most of the women. This is happening even in the modern society of today.

To create an equal society within the two sexes we have to start with pieces of the hole matter. Therefore it is a great opportunity for me as an future teacher to start this process in school. I also urge to already working teachers if not dealing with this to do so at once. Remembering the pupils are the future and we as adults have to do our best to let them in to it.",0
69,0193.a2.txt,Why You and the Rest of the World Would Gain from a Vegetarian Diet,"Why do you eat meat? Probably because you are used to it, you grew up eating fish and meat. So why bother to change your diet now? Because you and the rest of the world would gain from it and feel better. 
My first contact with vegetarianism was at school in my early teens. Our domestic-science book contained a page or two explaining what vegetarians and vegans eat, and reasons for people to stop eating meat and fish. Utterly boring recipes followed: different salads and baked potatoes with grated carrots. Turn a few pages and there you find a picture and a lovely recipe on chicken. That poor bird had probably lived a miserable life in a metal-grating cage. Why eat it? A few years later my mother went into fits when I declared I would no longer eat meat. Another few months and I could not face the fish on my plate. I was a vegetarian. My mother has now accepted my decision and knows a vegetarian diet will not do me any harm. She has also heard my reasons for being a vegetarian and she has no argument stronger than mine.
Many meat eaters defend themselves with the fact that man has been a hunter and eaten meat for thousands of years. Yes, true, I am not going to deny that. But does it give us the right to torture cattle and give them antibiotics and hormones in order to make them grow and give more meat; or force chickens to live in tiny cages where they can hardly turn around; or over-feed pigs so their pork shall taste more; or breed a muscular and enormous species (Belgian Blue) to get more meat, not caring the heifers cannot survive giving natural birth to their calves? Those hunters you mentioned, they hunted wild animals that lived free lives. Fair enough. Breeding cattle that is badly treated and tortured, given electric shocks when protesting against the cruelties and fed with other, dead animals even though they normally eat grass; everything is done because ""man is a meat eater"", not because animals feel better from it. I am convinced that we would never had heard of BSE (Mad Cows Disease), had our cattle, pigs and chickens been treated as living animals, instead of the future food and money they are considered to be today. By eating meat, you support these cruelties and give those who are torturing their cattle more money to do so. 
If everybody ate vegetarian food we would be able to feed every single human being on this planet. No more starvation. That, in my opinion, is the best reason in the world to stop eating meat. Unfortunately, most farmland is used for growing crops to feed cattle, and then us, as meat. This is economically more profitable, but feeds fewer people. A soya bean crop from one acre of land will feed one person for five years. The same areal grown with barley to rear beef cattle would feed a man for four months. The money of the rich Western World rules, the people of the Third World pay the price - they starve. Think of that next time you dig into your steak.
My third reason for a vegetarian diet is good health. Meat and fish rot in your bowels. The long, winding system of our digestive tract is much longer than those of meat-eating animals are. The meat rot and you get indigestion. Vegetables, fruit, grains, beans and pulses, on the other hand, are very good for your digestion. They contain dietary fibre, which make wonders for the digestion. It is often argued that vegetarians do not get enough protein and iron. Meat and fish are very good sources of protein, indeed, but beans, nuts and pulses contain the same amount of, and often more, protein. The human body more easily assimilates the iron in animal products than the iron in food of vegetarian origin, that is true. Vitamin C, found in vegetables and fruit, helps the body to absorb iron and since vegetarian food is rich in vegetables there is usually no reason to worry. If you suspect your intake of iron is not enough, an iron supplement is recommended. Most vegetarian food is very low in fat (the fat you find is of the good kind: unsatured), rich in carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals and a well-balanced diet will provide enough protein. 
Finally, knowing that those delicious vegetarian dishes mean no cruelty to animals, are a small victory in the war against starvation and good for your health - do you still want your beefburger? No, I did not think so.",0
70,0194.a2.txt,THE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS NEVER RIGHT!,"Since the beginning of time the strong ones has oppressed the weak ones. It has not always been considered a crime to kill or torture a human being. But the time changes and so do mankind. This barbarian way became less usual and the killing were considered illegal. The struggle against capital punishment have been successful but only 100 of the worlds 193 countries have abolished or ceased to carry out the punishment. Sweden abolished the capital punishment in the year 1921. But several surveys in the last couple of years have shocked me and I also believe many others. Because the surveys show that an increasing number of people, and especially young persons, can consider to reintroduce the capital punishment. I think this is terrible and very frightening, and I hope this essay will show you why.
The right to life is the most fundamental part of the Human Rights Agenda. To claim the right to life for innocent people is not very difficult. It goes without saying. It is considerably harder to defend people with horrible crimes on their consciences; mass-murderers, war criminals, paedophiles etc. But that is how universal rights works. They applies to everyone, everywhere and during all circumstances. Argument from the point of view of usefulness, for example that one death of a mass-murderer is better than the future death of ten victims, ignores the most fundamental value - that killing is wrong.
Since killing is wrong, the fact that some States' laws recommend public murders to prevent their citizens to commit murder, seems absurd and full of contradictions. How can you show that killing is wrong and try to administer justice by killing? It is totally impossible to achieve justice by killing another person. And there is nothing that indicates that the capital punishment prevents criminality. The crimes of violence follow a curve that is due to social and economical factors at a certain point of time. It is also independent of if the capital punishment exists or is abolished. Since the capital punishment was abolished in Canada has for example the brutal crimes decreased. But it has increased in the American states where it has been reintroduced. In all parts of the world this is a punishment that mostly affects the poor people, minorities and other oppressed or already outcasts of society.
An execution of a human being is an act that is known to have a brutalising effect. The capital punishment has therefore a negative influence on the people in the society where it is used. If the State consider themselves capable of killing a person in their custody, other people can interpret the killing as something accepted and right in its connection.
Another argument, which speaks for itself to abolish the capitol punishment, is that every year a number of totally innocent people are executed. That is mostly due to meagre and incorrect trials. My opinion is that this can never be aloud to happen. But it does, obviously, and an abolishment of the capital punishment is the only way to avoid it.
The capital punishment is the ultimate form of torture. It gives the absolute power to a few men and women to decide if a person will live or not. That kind of power can not be accepted in a democracy. It is the same thing with the right to stop an execution. That power often lies in the hands of only one person that don't need to answer for the decision to anyone.
The capital punishment is irreconcilable with the Human Rights. It is also unnecessary and totally unacceptable in a state governed by law, especially a democracy. To speak for abolishing the capital punishment is not to accept cruel crimes. It is to say no to deadly violence, even the killing that takes place in the name of the law. I think, as I hope this essay have shown, that the capital punishment violates every person's right to live. And I think it is an ancient way of punishment, I like to think that mankind has developed. The question is if I should have the same view of the matter if somebody would kill a member of my family or one of my close friends. I hope I will never find out.",0
71,0195.a2.txt,Sweden in the EU - or not?,"Introduction
The topic I am going to deal with is a very complex one. For that reason, there are many facts about the European Union (EU) that I will leave out, and also things that I really haven't got enough knowledge of to be able to say anything about. The question in this essay is should Sweden leave the EU? I feel that we should, and therefore I'm going to show a couple of arguments that speak in favour of this. There are also some counter-arguments, which I will not get into very deeply, but yet I will touch upon them. 

Argumentation
One of the greatest disadvantages of the EU, according to me, is that all the decisions that are made in the EU Parliament are harder for the Swedes to influence, than if they were made in the Swedish Parliament. The EU ministers have not got as much knowledge of for example Swedish products as we do ourselves, and therefore I think many things should be decided in Sweden instead. I believe that some things that the EU Parliament discusses are unimportant issues, which the EU has got nothing to do with.
One example of this is that the EU wants to control the length of cucumbers, so they all are about the same length. Another one is that neither the Swedish ""snus"" (moist snuff) nor ""minimj√∂lk"" (low-fat milk) was going to be allowed at first, but now I think the EU ministers have changed their minds and that they are going to allow them after all. Sometimes there has been a conflict, when Swedish environmental legislation has been more restrictive than the EU allows. I think it should be encouraged to be restrictive in that sense. It really is awful that they want us to ease our rules. 
These and other issues that concern Sweden are important for us to decide upon ourselves. Of course, some general rules about environmental policy and other issues concerning the whole of Europe are good to have. But when it comes to, what I think, silly cucumber rules, and more local matters, the EU should not be able to legislate and regulate everything.
A counter-argument to this might be that if we leave the EU, we would not be a part of the European Parliament, and thereby it would be more difficult to have an influence on the other European countries' policies. But I still think that according to what has been said above, we would benefit from leaving the EU on the whole. 
That was about democracy in decision-making. Another thing to bring up is commerce. Before Sweden joined the EU, some people meant that we had to join, otherwise we would be excluded from all the trading in Europe. The reason for their concern was that the EU is surrounded by a ""wall"" with tolls, which means that to buy goods from EU countries is very expensive because of taxes, while there is a duty-free zone inside the ""walls"", and therefore inexpensive to trade with other EU countries. Our export and import would, according to them, definitely benefit from a membership. 
The question I am asking myself is what about the rest of the world? Are the European countries the only countries we trade with? No, I don't think so, but some products might be produced only in Europe and in that case these would of course be more expensive if we left the EU. But other ones could perhaps be bought quite cheap from Asia, South America or North America, and then, why be so worried?

Conclusion
As I wrote in the introduction, I believe that Sweden could manage quite well without being a member of the EU, a membership that costs us too much money, I think. If we left the EU, we would be allowed to make our own decisions and set our own rules. In Sweden, we strive for that the decisions should be made as near the people as possible, but when becoming a member state of the EU, that goal was obviously forgotten. We should not have joined the union in the first place, but since we have, our goal should now be to leave it.",0
72,0196.a2.txt,With rights come obligations,"Swedish society today is facing a big problem with a rather high rate of unemployment, especially among youths, combined with a poor public sector. Therefore I think society should require people who get unemployment benefit to do unpaid community work in the public sector. There are a lot of lonely people or people in need of some sort of support they can no longer get from the society, as well as there are a lot of unemployed people in need of something new in their lives. So for this reason and for others, as I will try to argue for in this essay, this solution would be in the best interest of both society and the unemployed. 

In the climate of Swedish society today, with the cut-backs and urbanisation for example, the safety net that used to exist no longer does. In the small villages and the large families people looked out for one another in a different way. Today there are many lonely elderly or sick people, and many children in need of extra attention, that would benefit a lot from something as simple as company. The unemployed have the time to make a difference in these peoples lives. I do not mean that they should do the work of nurses, trained home help or teachers, but simply to be a friend and companion.

One might argue that this would take real jobs of the market, but this is not my intention at all. We have to face the fact that cut-backs have been made and more will have to come. I do not want the unemployed to replace the professionals, but it could be a way to make the cut-backs in the public sector somewhat easier on the people affected. The unemployed would, when possible, be a company, read the newspaper or talk with the elderly, or be some kind of special friend to children who needs them.

To be a friend requires a certain personal chemistry, they have to get along and I realise that not all are suited to work with people, but these are just examples of ways of doing unpaid community work. And there are a lot of people who are suited to work with people, and it might be stimulating for them to meet someone from another generation. Perhaps it would even give them a different view on their role in society. At the least it would give them daily routines, a reason to get up in the morning, and it would probably be a merit when they apply for a job. A part of the problem of youth unemployment today is that the young are never really let in to the labour market, they can neither get the experience or qualifications needed, and this would improve their CV for future job seeking.

The argument ""To get a different view on their role in society"" might sound a bit naive and grandiose, but I will try to explain why I brought this up. I see a rather scary problem today in that people, especially of my generation, doesn't recognise our obligations to other people, or to the society. We are very clear on our rights, the right to good education, healthcare, elderly care, unemployment benefits and social allowance, but the thought of earning these rights never crosses our minds. What this comes of would take another essay to sort out, but I think it is time to change this attitude and to accept that with rights come obligations. We have to realise that it is up to us to do something about the problems we are facing, we can't blame the politicians for not fixing the problem when we aren't doing anything ourselves. One way of contributing I think would be for the unemployed to do some unpaid community work they feel that they are suited for.

 To do unpaid community work of the kind I mentioned earlier, to be a companion for an elderly person would serve the attitude change by giving new ideas about values in life and lead to personal development, when the right personal combination is made. The same thing of course could happen when getting to know and taking care of a child.

To require recipients of unemployment benefits to do unpaid community work would be one way of changing the attitudes and to get us all to realise what being a part of a society means, and to ask ourselves how we can contribute. So in conclusion I want to say that if the right personal combinations are maid and if the right kind of work is found this suggestion is in the best interest of both the unemployed and of society.",0
73,0197.a2.txt,Effects of writing,"The two main effects of writing - perpetuation of thoughts, and understanding of the topics involved - (although I know that they intertwine) are among the reasons why education in writing in the Swedish schools should be improved, even at the possible decrease of education in certain other topics - the latter being a cost that is controversial, but nontheless necessary, and, as I will show, wise.
The perhaps most tangible effect of writing is that it has longer duration than speach. Somehow one would therefore draw the conclusion that which is being given longer life should be more important, and many pupils do write more carefully than they speak, but a considerate number of them do not make the extra effort because they want to, but because they need to.
They do not have the means to write what they want in the speed that they would want. They lack methods, techiques and tricks of the trade. The writing becomes an approximation, much like the usage of a second language differs from a mother tongue. Approximations are never quite satisfying, especially if they are made in areas of creativity. 
But the speed and the accuracy are not the only reasons to why this is an important issue. It is also a matter of fairness. You would not a music teacher teach who cannot sing or play the piano, and therefore it stands to reason that teachers with the task of teaching pupils to write should be able to write. This is not the case, however, when most teachers are concerned. The result of this is that it is not uncommon for teachers to kill creativity in writing, because of lack of interest and experience. I admit that there is less education in music, which perhaps makes it easier to find experienced teachers, but on the other hand, that merely means that the emphasis is on writing. The more hours set aside for a subject in the curriculum, the more important is the subject, obviously. Writing is considered more fundamental than other subjects, and necessarily so, since our culture is based on writing. Every other subject depends on the understanding of writing, and that is why there is an apparant need for more qualified teachers and for more attention to this matter at the school authorities.
The other main effect of writing is that it solidifies the understanding of the subject. Writing is in many ways similar to mirrors. They can both be used to discover dirt on ourselves, without the assistance of others, and they can both be used as tools to examine things outside ourselves. The former function is about understanding oneself, which is a highly complicated matter, and notions about oneself often do not get their right proportions until they are written down, next to several others. This is, for example, what diaries and logs are used for, but also many a story. I do think that most people could benefit from writing more, but that habit do not come naturally, and here teachers are somewhat responsible, but they need support and training. 
The latter function, in keeping with the mirror metaphore, can be thought of as a periscope. In some cases, writing can be used to understand a subject, as it permits and forces you to look at the topic at hand from different perspectives. I notice regularly, for example, that I do not quite grasp the subject completely before I write about it. This is probably due to the fact that an idea can be judged more clearly from a little distance. Sometimes it is only when you work with a subject, and, for example, write about it, that you discover what kind of information you need. This experience is as important, if not more so, than being able to do long divisions. 
This is perhaps more of a change in focus than a set of new ideas. It can sound as revolutionary changes, taking a lot of time and effort, but these are sooner small but important changes, for society, the school system and each individual pupil.",0
74,0198.a2.txt,Take a decision now.,"In this essay I am going to talk about the position of the European Highway four (E4) in Uppland, and especially in Uppsala. There has been a discussion since the 1960s about moving the highway out of Uppsala and to make a new construction of the road section between Mehedeby and Uppsala. Everybody seems to be agreed that something has to be done but it has not been possible to reach a decision about where to place the new road section. This discussion has to come to an end. My suggestion is that we shall have a referendum in Uppsala County in this issue. In that way the will of the people who are concerned will be showed. In this essay I will concentrate on what I think is the main reasons to get a decision now and why I think so.
  The main reason of why the highway shall be moved is that people suffers. By that I mean both the people who lives along the highway and those who are involved in all the accidents which happens in this road. The highway in its present condition has a very high rate of accidents. Its standard does not correspond in any way to the large number of vehicles using it. The highway passes through several communities besides Uppsala with reduced passable and large problems of road safety. The length through Uppsala County may today be seen as a bottleneck in its connection between the north of Sweden and the area of Uppsala-Stockholm. This bottleneck often leads to dangerous and irresponsible driving with accidents as a result. These accidents cost a great deal, both in human suffering and purely economic.
The costs are another main reason to why I see it as an urgent issue to take a decision now. One can wonder how much all these discussions, investigations and delaying has cost our community. One of the alternatives of a new road construct is the eastern proposition; it would be safer and less expensive than the western proposition. To me the eastern alternative sounds like a natural choice. Other arguments in this discussion are that the new highway in some alternatives is going to disturb eradicate threatened animals and that roadwork is going to take place in one of the greatest areas of ancient remains in Sweden. I do understand these arguments but to me human suffering and safety are more important. One other result of the accidents on the highway is that the police have to watch over the distances between vehicles. This is also a cost and perhaps the police are better needed some other place. 
This has also become a cost to the whole country now, and that is just because our local politicians cannot decide by themselves where to construct the new highway. This issue is now a case for the government and the Swedish national road administration. This is unfortunate for us in Uppsala County, because these authorities work without any special consideration to our County's wishes. This is the reason to why I suggest we shall have a chance to tell our wishes in a referendum. It may also decline the contempt of politicians that is so common today. 
In conclusion I would like to say that we have a great deal to win by take a decision now, so we can go through with the construction of a new highway as soon as possible. We need a new road to be able to securely and simply transport goods and people through Uppsala. This new road is going to cost a great deal of money, so it would be stupid to spent any more money on further investigations. Let the people say their wishes. Over thirty years of debate is more than enough. Let us take a decision now.",0
75,0199.a2.txt,Work in return of unemployment benefit,"Today the unemployment rate in Sweden is very high. This means that we have a great manpower to derive advantage from. I think that the unemployment benefit should be used as a sort of wage for jobless people working in the public sector. It is a very important step in the struggle against unemployment and on the whole in the improvement of the economy. 

First of all there is work to be done in the public sector, in some areas more than other's is. It seems to me that the greatest need is in the social sector, the eldercare is understaffed as well is education and the medical service. This is a major problem in Swedish society that has become aggravated in the last couple of years. When the budget is too low workers is being dismissed and left with unemployment benefit. Still the need of workforce in these services remains. Off course one of the difficulties is that ""free"" work done by unemployed would enter in to competition with employed manpower. I suggest that the unemployment benefit should be seen as a kind of salary when the work is within the public sector. 

An other part of the subject I find substantial is the enhance of the jobless self-image. The more time a person stay unoccupied the less is the chance of re-employment and obviously this doesn't promote growth. Workers that have been left without a job need to do something meaningful to maintain their self-esteem. Having permanent work has always been important, not only to get paid but to be accepted in the community. To loose that part of your life might lower your belief in yourself to that extent you don't dare to seek another occupancy. I really don't think that a person can feel satisfaction doing nothing but eat and sleep. We are all humans who need a bit of a challenge and some appreciation each day to survive. This you achieve in your work.

Maybe some people wouldn't agree with me and say the authorities shouldn't force you to a certain job. That is very true, but my opinion is that if you are not willing to offer your help you should get less compensation.

 One of the problems today is that some people for economical reasons rather stay at home unemployed than take a low paid job. To receive benefits shouldn't pay off or is an alternative to employment. It should only be a short-time solution.

The solution I am talking about is till the unemployed himself is strong enough to find a regular job. Maybe a person that has been left without a job for a long time doesn't see an end to it. If that same person is offered work he could actually get his own ideas of future occupation. Trying new areas to work in can lead to an interest in a complete different branch. It can also be a good way to make new useful contacts. Little by little the former unemployed perhaps could start his own firm or get hired by a company. That would be the main goal of this proposal. I feel strongly for free enterprising and think that it is most important that we act for it. My reasoning can seem contradictory when I propagate private business and at the same time wish for work in the public sector as an exchange for benefits. The explanation of this is that I don't think everybody has the courage to start an own business right after being dismissed, nor do they have the means and knowledge. I want the exchange of work and benefit to be a push in the right direction and to maintain an available work force. 

The reason I first discussed was suffer from being understaffed in the public sector that could be helped by the work of the jobless. The next motive I mentioned was about the self-esteem and how it could be improved with work. The last argument is that of ""free"" work being a short-time solution and that this would inspire the unemployed to a real work. I want you to keep in mind that this is a force we have to use, not only for the common good but also for each unemployed individual. I believe a working man is a happier man.",0
76,0200.a2.txt,THERE IS STILL TIME TO LEAVE THE EU,"In January 1995 Sweden joined the EU despite the fact that the result from the popular vote the previous year showed a very weak majority with 51% of the population for joining and 48% against. Joining the EU was a big and important decision and with as many as 48% of the population voting against it, one can wonder why the decision-makers did not wait a year or two to make that decision, during which time they could have arranged another popular vote which might have showed a stronger majority in either direction. I could go on criticising the decision they made and also the lack of information before the popular vote and the way in which it was carried out, but I will not go further into that because Sweden has indeed already joined the EU and my primary object here is to elucidate why Sweden should leave the EU. Certain advantages have been gained from joining the EU, admittedly, but when weighing the pros and cons, the advantages do not make up for all drawbacks and disadvantageous responsibilities.
The opportunity to work or study in another European country sounds tempting for a lot of Swedish people and is one of the few truly positive things about the EU, but the truth is that we did not have to join to gain that opportunity. Sweden had already signed the EEC agreement which allowed capital, people, goods and labour to move freely into and within the EU. The EEC agreement basically gave us all the opportunities and advantages we need and want, while joining the EU meant that we now have to pay good money for these benefits and that the politicians down in Brussels can tell us how to run our own country. Sweden is one of the smallest countries in Europe when considering the size of the population, which means that we do not have a lot of power in the European parliament with only 22 seats compared to, for instance, Germany's 99 seats. Consequently, politicians from other European union countries can make decisions we disagree with, decisions that could affect us greatly. At the same time we are one of the three countries which pay the highest membership fees. What do we get for that money? Not much. The sad truth is in fact that Sweden do not get many benefits compared to other European union countries. We give a lot, we get little and we are not even allowed to apply our own laws.
Sweden is known to have strict laws and regulations regarding everything from additives in food to drugs and weapons. This is changing and there is nothing we can do about it. Since we joined the EU our domestic law is subordinate to EU law which in most cases is a lot more liberal. For instance, we no longer have the right to demand exhaustive declarations of contents when it comes to food, make-up, shampoo or even paint and other chemical goods. Our customs supervision has become almost non-existent since the customs officers' right to check passports and luggage has been ridiculously restricted, and this has indeed led to an increase in smuggling, concerning both drugs and weapons. It is a brilliant idea to make it easier for people and companies to move across the borders, but why do we have to have the same laws and regulations regarding everything, even within the culinary area? Every single strawberry in Europe has to attain the standard size before it can be sold, every meatball and sausage has to contain a certain amount of meat to deserve its name, and Sweden has to have the genetically manipulated Belgian Blue-meat for sale in supermarkets across the country.
Personally, I have never understood this never ending striving for uniformity within the EU. Is not that a part of the charm about going abroad, to meet new cultures and traditions, new ways of dealing with things? There is absolutely nothing wrong with collaboration but this EU hysteria for standardisation has gone to far and soon we are even supposed to have the same currency. Luckily Sweden has not signed that deal yet because it would probably be more difficult to leave the EU if we had done so. As it is now there is still time to leave and it is my opinion that Sweden should leave the EU as soon as possible. Some people argue that it would cost too much to leave because of some absurd penalty fee, but how much does it not cost us now and how much will it not continue to cost us if we stay? We should leave now and spend that money trying to reconstruct our once so prosperous Sweden.",0
77,0201.a2.txt,What does the Royal Family has to do with democracy?,"Sweden is, in my opinion a fantastic country. We have everything, the best sex equality, legal right of access to private land, freedom for the people and we have a democracy that works. We are raised in a free country were everybody is equal. We should be very proud of all this things. The Swedes are a happy people. But there is one thing that is not right with this picture. What does the Royal Family has to do with democracy? 
Here in Sweden we tell our children that all people, irrespective of skin colour, what their parents do for a living, if they are handicapped or not, are equal. No one is better than the other. We even have it written in our constitution. What message do we send to our children when it is obvious that the Royal children are smarter than the rest of the children in Sweden? The whole Royal Family is better and has a greater value than an ordinary Swedish family. The monarchy is contrary to the Swedish way of living, our ""policy"". It is one thing if you have studied and have got an education that will make you earn a lot of money. Then you have done something, you have worked hard to be someone. That is fair. But what have the Swedish King done to deserve his life? He is born to it. Is not this obsolete? It does not fit in in our modern Swedish society. My thoughts goes a long way back in time to the old ""farmer society"", when the social classes were extremely important. The Royal Family of Sweden is a relic from the past.
Since Sweden is a free, modern and equal country should not we be able to decide who we want to represent the country? It is us, the people the King and the Royal Family are representing. Wouldn't it be better if we voted for the person we wanted for king or queen? Are we not intelligent enough to decide this our selves? Sweden shall have a person that have achieved something, someone who have to work his or her way to the top. A person we can be proud of. A man or woman who is like us, who is one of us. The King is not one of us, he is absolutely not one of the people. We need a human beeing that we could identify our selves with and relate to. 
Another aspect of this is the taxes, why should the Swedish people's taxes go to the Royal Family? In this country we need better schools, better geriatric care and a lot of other important things. The people should not have to pay for this family. I am certain that a lot of people would agree with me if I say that we do not need this kind of representation. Representation is of course very important but the kind of representation we are dealing with here can be done by someone else, like a President for example. We need the money to our selves. Maybe it is not large figures, but it is the principle. 
Sometimes when I am at my hairdressers' or at my parent's house I read this women-gossip magazines and I have to admit I really enjoy it. I read about the boyfriend of the Princess for example, and I often think that it is very interesting. But it is not important to me or to anyone else to know about this people. The purpose of the Royal Family these days has become to entertain a very small group of people, very often old women. But isn't that all we get out of them in a modern society of today? To be honest, is the Royal Family of Sweden really that necessary?",0
78,0202.a2.txt,Knowledge costs,"I will here deal with some of the main arguments why the government should give the university students grants, not loans, to finance their studies. In the modern world, knowledge and education have become keywords. Nowadays we are exporting knowledge as merchandise and each individual country grows with its proficiency of the people. Each man grows intellectual with knowledge. It has become more and more important to be able to communicate with other countries. We are getting closer to people with different cultures and traditions, and to be able to live nearer each other we must understand each other. This can only be achieved throw studying. The medical science are helping people to prevent diseases and sufferings. For the science and for normal living we are using a lot of technical facilities as computers, robots, which needs maintenance by people. This needs knowledge and education. Some people may argue that we could use the robots even for the keeping up, including keeping up themselves, and perhaps also as inventors. In a world like that, the robots are those in authority and not people.

Education is expensive. Teachers are needed as equipment and buildings. For all this student don't have to pay. But they have to pay for textbooks, living, a place to stay at and food. The system today offers loan to finance the expenses including a symbolic amount of grant, in all a sum of money that is regarded less than low-income earner. The study loan is more favourable than ordinary loans, but often the debt will grow during the greater part of working life and some people may never be able to repay their debt, especially low-income earner and women. Choosing to study you know that you have to live in fixed economical limits with no possibility to improve your economical situation. In the current system you mustn't make more money than the government have decided that a student should manage with without cut downs. This will influence people with less money to avoid or study as little as possible and it will be of great differences between those who could live at their parent's home with free food and those who have to move to an other city because of their studies. As university studies aren't compulsory you may chose to work instead, to make money and to have a normal living.

The system with free education was made to give everyone a chance to study at a university despite of person's background. The intelligence, not money, should determine whether to study at a university or not. But investigations have shown that in spite of free education most of the people who study are those from academic families with a tradition of studying and not working-class people. This system, though based on a compulsory comprehensive schools where all kind of pupils are mixed, won't make intelligent people to continue studying but instead just makes everyone equally bad. More over, studying in Sweden is regarded as a personal development, which means that educated people shouldn't make more money than uneducated people. Further investigations have shown that a person who chooses to work directly after the compulsory school will earn more money during his lifetime than an educated person who in addition has contracted a huge dept. To choose to study you mustn't be afraid of getting into debt.

A system with grants instead of loans for university studies would encourage more people to study, which is beneficial for the country. To make progresses for the society you need every intelligent people you can possible find. A decrease in education differences between working-class and people with tradition of studying or people who can afford education would also be achieved. Such system would cost very much for the country, but as an investment the country will get great dividend of knowledge and progress. This investment assume that every educated person will stay in the country. Unfortunately there is a growing trend of high educated people moving abroad. This is a great problem which has to be dealt with. But despite of this, the opportunity to develop intellectual through studying mustn't be limited to some few people but has to be intended for everybody where not money or the fear of getting into debt are limiting.

79,0203.a2.txt,Enrich life - become a teacher,"Since the beginning of time one of human beings most important tasks has been to propa-gate their species and bring the descendants up to strong and intelligent young people. In my opinion the latter is still one of our main purposes of life and therefore I find it strange that only a few people think that their mission of life is to bring children up professionally as teachers. Even more strange is that so many are reluctant to work with education. I am of opposit opinion and have always known I wanted to teach. Notwithstanding that firm conviction I often find myself arguing for teaching, and defending my choice of a profes-sion to people around me. This is what I will do in this essay as well.
These peoples first argument always tend to deal with money. They find it incredible that anyone with a common sense would study four years at a University for a salary of 15 000 Swedish crowns and with small chances of a great increase of wages. This argu-ment both puzzles and alarms me. It puzzles me because everyone ought to be aware of the present debate on teachers' wages which sooner or later must lead to the better. It alarms me because I think it is awkward that acquaintances of mine are that materialistic and think money is of such importance that they would rather have a boring well-paid job than an interesting less well-paid one, given that they can not have both. Naturally, eco-nomy is an important aspect of life but such is work, since you generally spend about half of your awake hours working. That sums up to quite some hours in a lifetime and therefore I prefer a vocation I really enjoy. 
Next counterargument is often that the school has an extremely hectical atmosphere, with pupils behaving like hooligans, which can give anyone a nervous breakdown in a few weeks. Admittedly such a scene is not impossible but I am inclined to believe that such a situation depends mainly on the teacher. If the teacher loves children, enjoy being with them and is experienced as well as prepared of some children being awfully mischie-vous it should not occur. Personally, I think dealing with all these different unpredictable young individuals is exciting and a charming part of the profession. Likewise, getting through the barricades and reaching the real restive and disorderly ones is a satisfactory kick without equivalence.
Even though not always feeling satisfied with classroom performance, a teacher always feel needed which is a most important sense. While others are tearing their hair because of inability to change what is wrong in society, a teacher can actually do something about the so-called decadence of human morals and society. The mere becoming a teacher actu-ally means doing something valuable for the society because of the scarcity of teachers. Until the year of 2000, 62 000 new full-time teachers must be employed in Sweden. 
10 000 of these will not be educated. That is to say, there will not be a problem finding a job because of the many vacancies and the fact that there is a school - which implies a potential place of work for a teacher - in every inhabited region.
Being attractive on the labour-market, is a reason as good as any to become a teacher, but from my point of view the nonmonotonous and flexible method of working is of greater importance. I am aware of that being a teacher includes working long hours in a stressful and loud environment, but I am convinced that it will never get tedious and dull. As a teacher every single day is a new challange, one never know what will happen during the day and always need a plan B and C up one's sleeve. 
In conclusion I find numerous reasons for becomimg a teacher, but some people consider them only three: June, July and August. Undoubtly those are tempting, but the main reason for anyone to become a teacher ought to be the possibility to work with children, follow their development and bring them up to strong and intelligent account-able citizens. Teaching is hard work and will not turn anyone economically rich over-night, but I am sure it is a very enriching vocation when it comes to quality of life. For-tunately, one can always educate to be a teacher and then marry rich.",0
80,0204.a2.txt,BREAKING THE LAW,"In 1994 I became a member of Amnesty International. One of their basic principles is that they are an opponent of death penalty. I do agree with their opinion because death penalty is an unfair way to punish people. Firstly the executed person could have been innocent. Secondly the law says it is prohibit to perpetrate murder but the law itself is allowed to execute a person. Finally there are several alternatives to death penalty which are more humane.

To begin with the perpetrator -what if the one is not guilty? Imagine that a person has been convicted and killed and then it turns out that the person who was sent to death was innocent. At this point it is useless to apologise. On the other hand, the victim and the relatives would probably want to see the perpetrator dead. Imagine that a member of your family has been killed, would you not want the murderer killed? Undoubtedly this is a very complex discussion. Thus there should be a consequent law. 

Moreover, the law is not consequent when it comes to capital punishment. Though the law prohibit a person to perpetrate a murder the law should not be able to murder someone either. In other words capital punishment is a contradiction against itself. In some areas of Asia there have been cases when people have been executed without legal proceedings. A person who just is suspect to be a criminal could be executed. I think that the law should be responsible for the decision of whom is or is not guilty. And also all individuals should have the right to investigate their case in court.

Unfortunately the court could not tolerate criminality, it must be emphasised what is right or wrong. But a person who have perpetrate a crime once is easily capable to do it a second time. In addition to this an execution of the perpetrator would be a solution and even a lifetime in prison would prevent this. To execute a criminal is wrong, its just like taking revenge, but to send the guilty person to prison for a lifetime is more logical. In my opinion the criminals deserve lifetime penalties though they have destroyed another person's life or maybe many person's lives. On the contrary some people say that lifetime penalty is not severe enough. They say that death penalty should frighten people to avoid criminality. But statistics show that there are not less crimes in the areas were there have capital punishment.

Other people make propaganda for death penalty based on economical reasons. They say it is cheaper to execute a person than to send the one to prison. In general this is not truth. Naturally this depends on what kind of executions are chosen. However, I do not think it is the right way to see this from an economical point of view. It is a more complex problem than that. 

In conclusion I will stress that death penalty should not be acceptable of any reasons. That is an opinion I share with many people. Once I have had an argumentation with a friend of mine who is a relative to a raped person. I did realise that my arguments could not even be compared to my friend's arguments full of anger and revenge against the perpetrator. I really do understand my friend. Luckily the attacked person survived but she is hurt though and probable she wont get over it -ever. But somehow to create justice there must be a fair law that everyone should follow. Think of it in this way, if someone breaks the law the one should of course get punished, but if the person gets executed one could say that the law is breaking the law itself.",0
81,0205.a2.txt,"SHOULD ""SOFT DRUGS"" BE LEGALISED?","All over the world there is a discussion about narcotic politics. On one side there arethose who suggest a liberalisation or even a legalisation of the ""soft"" narcotics (marijuana and haschish), while people on the other side wants restrictive narcotic politics. I agree with the ones who believe in restrictive and preventive narcotic politics, and don't believe in a legalisation of drugs, not even ""soft drugs"". In this essay, I'll take up some of my main arguments againstlegalisation of ""soft drugs"".

First of all I would like to tear down one argument, used by advocators of legalising ""soft drugs"". They claim that ""soft drugs"" are harmless, but it's proved that even small dozes of for example haschish hurt the brain and use of ""soft drugs"" also lead to further experimentation on other drugs. They are often an entrance to heavier drugs.

Secondly, people who want a legalisation of the ""soft drugs"" can't answer questions on how they are planning to carry this out. For example I would like to know by whom the quality of the drugs will be checked, and who'll decide the strength and price of them? If drugs from society are lighter, and perhaps also more expensive than the ones on the street, no one will buy them. 

Other questions which the followers of legalising don't have any answers to are for example if the State will have monopoly of drugbusiness or if private corporations will have access to it as well. And have they planned to have agelimits, or restrictions for people with sensitive and important jobs like drivers, doctors, teachers and pilots? How much and how often should you be able to buy drugs? Will ""drug-shops"" be open twenty-four-hour a day? If not, people who want drugs will buy them on the streets anyway. I haven't received any answers on these questions, but spokesmen for legalisation maybe have planned to release ""soft drugs"" without any regulations at all, because regulations only create conditions for a black market.Besides that the campaign to legalise ""soft drugs"" gives non-satisfaction answers, or often lack out of answers on how they plan to carry out their ideas, there are more reasons against legalisation of the ""soft drugs"".

One of these reasons is that there's a connection between access to narcotics and use of them. If society decides to legalise ""soft drugs"" it becomes easier for people to buy them, and thereby they might end up in an abuse, because of the increased access to ""soft drugs"". This also effects the connection between supply and demand of these drugs. If there's a combination of easy access to large amount of ""soft drugs"" with liberal attitude from society about drugs, more persons will try the legal drugs, also those who wouldn't have tried if drugs had been illegal. This lead to higher demand and suddenly ""soft drugs"" have created a legal market with supply and demand. To decrease the number of (ab)users there must be a small access to narcotics and difficult to get hold of them. If there also are unpleasant consequences for using or dealing with drugs the amount of people who is taking them won't increase in the same way as if ""soft drugs"" were legalised. Left is only a group that run the risk of getting into drugabuse from the beginning. This group can society reach through support and treatment. Only then abuse can be defeated.

Society must take responsibility for its citizens. Abuse have to be seen in a social relation, not in a medical one. Society must prevent that young people gets into drugabuse, by preventive work, by not legalise drugs and by helping addicts through treatment. We must believe in society without narcotics, and not let ""soft drugs"" be legalised. It's when we give up our hope of a drugfree society legalisation movement can win. That's why many people supports ""harm reduction"" movement instead of supporting preventive work. Unfortunately ""harm reduction"" alone can't decrease the number of addicts. We need for example preventive work among young people to stop them from trying drugs.

If the number of addicts shall decrease, society can't declare that it's all right to use drugs. Then young people get a liberal attitude towards drugs and they are more likely to try them. If it also is easy to get ""soft drugs"" and that it's legal to use them, many more risk to end up in an abuse. When ""soft drugs"" no longer are strong enough, addicts will move over to heavier drugs, and this way society never will get rid of drugabuse and narcotics, and social misery will increase. We must declare a war against narcotics, instead of be resigned to drugabuse.

83,0207.a2.txt,The school grade system in Sweden,"Grades in school is presumable something we are going to have although the shape and performance might change, as it already has been several times. Around the 1980s the grades were gradually taken away from the younger students and only left from the eight level and up. This was good for the youngest students but not the one in sixth and seventh level; they are old enough to know the meaning of it or at least the purpose. Receiving grades for the first time in the eight level it is very late, for reflection and possibility for a major change, and for parents help and reaction. The level in which the students are ready for having a written school report is as I see it very important for their further education. 

Before the eighties when almost every level of classes received school reports, the students knew where they where standing although this was not a fair system because they had to compete for the grades. The teacher had to keep a certain level over the grades in the class. Today this is not the case, if you have a whole class that is doing great they all get high grades; this means that the competition over the highest one is gone. This makes it even more obviously for letting the students receive grades in the lower levels. The important of knowing where the students stand and what is needed of them for getting better grades. It seams unfair not knowing how ""good or bad"" you are until you are in the eight level. I know that the students together with their parents have a dialogue every term with their teacher discussing how the school-works goes, of course you get to know if it is really bad but the rest, now. They need to know in time for having a good chance to receive the grades they want when it is time for higher education. Students know that they need to study but a teenager has other interests that studies comes later. With grades from the sixth level the will hopefully take more responsibility.

When students receive their grades for the first time it seams that they are unaware of where they stand or more which their grades are. Students attend to take more notice of a written grade than words from the teacher or perhaps they only hear what they want to hear. What resound it might be is hard to say. From my one experience as a teacher, they really wont to know their marks and not only words telling them that they are doing find or that have to make a better effort to get any marks. Getting it in written is more effective than telling in words. The discussions with their teacher is not enough they need it written down, first then they are fully aware of what teachers think of their knowledge. A written paper with the marks on for all subjects cannot be misunderstood as a discussion can. Parents might say when they see the marks in the eight grade ""that is not what the teacher told us last time"" and then it is very hard to make up for what the student has missed. Both for the student and their parents it seams more fair to get a written report from the sixth grade in order to do something about the marks. The discussion with the teacher cannot be replaced by grades reports it is still needed although in an other purpose in the higher levels. 

The work for the teacher will not be much of a change because they are already more or less writing and receiving comments on their students. I believe that students will behave in another way if they knew they where getting a grade in subjects earlier than it is today. They will hopefully take it more seriously and not play around specially in subjects they dislike. In the point of the parents they will have more of a concrete matter when they are having discussions concerning schools subject and their children's efforts.",0
84,0208.a2.txt,Why practice martial arts?,"In this essay I will from a few aspects explain why I think practicing martial arts is highly recommendable. People who are against martial arts often make inadequate and sweeping statements about that kind of sports. I will here try to make clear what opinions I believe should be condemned, and why it is important not to generalize when talking about martial arts. 
One of the quite obvious reasons to practice martial arts is that it is very good exercise. It is an all-round training, that is, you use all parts of your body. Also, one of the main reasons why I have continued doing martial arts is that you self decide how much you want to strenghten yourself during a session and when % you want to grade for your next belt. As it is not a team-sport you do not have to do everything that your group do. Everyone practice the arts according to their own capacity. This, however, vary somewhat between different martial arts. Some might demand more physical strength than others.
The main reason why myself, I, started practicing martial arts six years ago, was to gain some knowledge in self-defence. I wanted my mother to stop worrying when I was out at night with my friends. I first did Aikido, but found that a bit too soft and started doing jujitsu instead. In jujitsu you first learn mainly techniques that could be used in order to protect yourself if you were assaulted on the street. Later on the training takes on a different character and is not that focused on self-defence. D ¬äuring my schoolyears, I have had the habit to try my newly gained knowledge on my fellow classmates. Most of the times it has not had the wished effect, mainly because they have been prepared on what I was going to do and also because many of the techniques are not that good in self-defence. Those techniques need the partner to cooperate to make the technique work without causing serious injuries. My classmates have however exclusively made the statement: ""It doesn't work, so why do you practice jujitsu?"". The point is that you, in a certain sense, get another attitude to violence when practicing martial arts. If someone would attack me today I would probably not use something I learned at the jujitsu sessions, but I would be more prepared. No matter how absurd it might sound, fact is that I am used to people strangeling and hitting me, and If something happened for real, I would hopefully not ¬∑ just stand there completely paralyzed. I would do something, even if it was not a proper jujutsu technique.
The main argument you hear why people should not practice martial arts is that it increases violence in society. I, however, find that absolutely ridiculous. I would say that that argument is mainly used by people who try to blaim other people for their maladjusted children. I claim that the main reason to the violence in society is that many parents do not spend enough time with their children. Instead of teaching their children how to behave, they employ the TV and video as baby-sitter. The parents have no control over what their children are watching and many children nowadays grow up in the belief that you can kick someone in the head ten times without causing much damage. I admit that there are people who start doing martial arts in order to learn how to ""beat the shit out of someone"", but they are relatively few. These people are usually members of, for instance, karate- and tae kwon do- clubs (but the attitude in those clubs of course vary from club to club as well), and it is sad that they should damage the reputation of all martial arts. I have for instance never heard of any abuse of the practice of jujitsu in the five years I have been practicing that sport, and there are many other martial arts that do not have that problem, like Judo, Aikido, Kendo and Tai-chi, just to mention a few. To this aspect I would also like to add that practicing martial arts is an opportunity to give vent to your aggressions in a controled form, rather than going down to the city centre and ""kick ass"". 
Other opponents to the arts claim that the violence learned from TV and video can escalate when bei ng practiced at the martial art clubs. Unfortunately, that is somewhat true, but if it is found out that someone do have misused a martial art the person is supposed to be suspended from his/her club. I can, however, admit that this abuse could be hard to discover and prove, and I am not sure to what extent it is being implemented. Maybe there should be a stricter control of the clubs in order to make them look out more for unserious members and to control the policy of the whole clubs. Still, the point is that not many clubs have this problem of abuse. I also claim on the contrary that at the martial art clubs you are taught how dangerous the kicks and paunches really are. You learn how to take control of a person without causing to much injuries. 
To conclude, I would √∂once again like to stress how important it is not to generalise when talking about martial arts. As there are so many different sorts of martial arts I believe that everyone could find something that would suit them (both from a physical and a philosophical point of view). People who argue that martial arts increase the violence in society should search themselves before making incorrect statements. They should be more specific and not speak of martial arts as violence-ridden sports in general.",0
85,0209.a2.txt,Homosexual couples right to adopt children,"Shall homosexuals be able to adopt children? This is an ongoing debate in the Swedish government today. Adoption of children shall always be done with starting-point of the child's well being. It is the child's right to parents that shall be the initial position for adoption and not the adult's right to have a child. The decision whether homosexuals should be able to adopt children must be based on how we create the best possible security for the child. Some homosexuals deal with their desire of having a child by insemination. In Sweden there live about 40 000 children in a home with at least one homosexual parent. These children do not belong to the family by law and would probably feel a lot more secure if they did. The debate is about whether homosexual men and women would be suitable parents. I will below argue against homosexual couples' right to adopt children.
My belief is that God created the human being. My basic argument is therefor that God created the man and the woman to reproduce. That is, heterosexuals are able to make babies and homosexuals are not. It speaks for it self that two people of the same sex are not supposed to have children since they can not make one in the way that it is normally done. 
Believers of the homosexual couples right to adopt children argue that it is better with a family to be loved by, than no family at all, whether the family consists of two men /two women or by a man and a woman. That is totally absurd, in my opinion. A child has the right to a normal family with the best possible possibility to a natural development and a normal sex-identity-process. A child who have lost its both biological parents is exposed in a double sense and shall therefor be protected from further stress that have to mean to growing up with two fathers or two mothers. 
Homosexuals argue that it is not the parents' sexual identity or the way that the family is put together, that has the greatest meaning for the child's development. The importance is that the child feels loved and gets the support that it needs. My argument is that a child needs both a mother and a father. Children need role models to look up to. I think that a child shall not grow up with two mothers or two fathers with the belief that they are a 'normal' family. By the law a 'normal' family, a nuclear family, consists of a man, a woman and a child. The society shall therefor not encourage homosexuals to adopt children.
Magnus Kihlbom, a child-psychologist, psychoanalyst and medical superintendent at the Erica-foundation in Stockholm, considers that homosexual adoptive parents are not consistent with the child's welfare. He is of the opinion that experience in child-psychiatric and child-therapeutic action gown for that adopted children have a more difficult initial position than other children. There is probably a risk for that the circumstance of being adopted by two homosexual men or two lesbian women living together would imply difficulties to the adopted children's mental development in several regards, irrespective of the adults sense of responsibility, caring and love or other qualities. A child is ought to grow up with a clear grasp about that children can not be born to the world without a sexual relation between a man and a woman.
For the time being there are no plans of changing the law. Today a person who is older than 25 years old has the right to adopt privately or as a family. A man or a woman who lives as an open homosexual, would by the committee on social questions, not be considered as a suitable parent. 
Writing this essay and arguing against that homosexuals shall not be able to adopt children, one should know that I have only had the children's well being in mind. It is not fair to place a child in a family with homosexual parents in a society with so many prejudices against homosexuals. It is, as I have already stated in the introduction, the child's right to parents that shall be the initial position for adoption and not the adult's right to have a child.",0
86,0213.a2.txt,Exercise: Good for your body and mind,"Great demands are made upon people today in form of long working hours, home and family. Many people burn themselves out and get ill. There are different ways of dealing with the stress we are exposed to and one of them is to exercise regularly. In this essay I am going to bring up some of the many positive effects exercise has on us physically as well as mentally but also discuss some negative aspects.

Like I said there are both physical and mental advantages of working out although the physical may be what first comes to mind. The body consists of about 300 different skeleton muscles, some more prominent than others. Their functions are to stabilise the joints and of course to enable movement. If a muscle is not used it will eventually get debilitated and in the long run wither. Since we live in a world of convenience, where we really don't have to move much and tend to spend a lot of our time in front of the TV or the computer, training our muscles to maintain their strength is very important. To be able to handle our often quite sedentary jobs without suffering from sore backs, stiffness and similar problems we need strong supporting muscles. The heart is also a muscle, which needs to work to stay fit. When exercising we increase the capacity of the heart, that is the heart is able to pump more blood with each beat and that way it doesn't have to work so hard to keep the blood circulating. This and the fact that we by exercising can avoid overweight helps preventing cardio-vascular diseases which are getting more and more frequent among people today due to the fast food, semi-manufactured products and in many cases lack of knowledge about how to keep a healthy diet.

Besides muscles we also have bones in our body, about 200 to be more exact. Between the bones are different joints that allow us to flex and extend for example our legs. If we don't get some exercise the joints stiffen and make it harder for us to move, we become less flexible. Our skeletons get strong and stabile from workout. The bones gets thicker and obtain a more efficient nutrient input due to the increased number of veins providing them with blood.

Now I've pointed out some positive physical effects of exercising, but we are also affected positively mentally. Like I said in the introduction exercise is a good way to deal with stress which get more and more important in our fast moving society. Many people use exercise as a form of meditation since it is quite easy to let go of all thoughts while working out. So a good workout helps the body and mind to relax and afterwards we feel good about ourselves and we have got new energy to face our lives. The fact that we function better, I think, is a very good argument for companies to introduce the possibility for the employees to exercise during working hours. 

Even though most people know that exercising is good, there are still many who for different reasons don't exercise. Only 56 percent of the adult Swedish population workout on a regular basis. One reason people might have not to exercise, is that they feel they don't have the time. This argument is untenable. It's not necessary to go to a gym or to head out on hours-lasting runs. It can be quite small things like walking or taking the bicycle instead of going by bus or car. Using the stairs instead of the elevator and things like that. A negative side of exercising is that if it's overdone, done with wrong technique or if things go wrong we might get injured. But if we exercise in moderation, keeping our bodies fit actually decreases the risk of us getting hurt.
 So the advantages are greater than the disadvantages. 

I've tried to show some of the positive effects exercise can have on both our bodies and minds and that it can help us cope better with the every-day life. It's important to find a form of exercise that suits us and that we enjoy. The main point is that we should have fun while exercising otherwise it would just become another source of stress. I workout at 'Friskis & Svettis' three times a week and I enjoy every moment of it. I hope I have inspired someone to start exercising.",0
87,0214.a2.txt,Why Sweden should have a wild wolf strain,"The debate concerning the existence of the wolf and the other three big predators (bear, lynx, and wolverine) we have in Sweden has been going on for centuries. Hardly any other animal is so much discussed as the wolf, and it seems as everyone has an opinion about him. Unfortunately, the wolf is often described as a bloodthirsty beast and a lot of legends and fairy tales like ""Little Red Riding Hood"" and ""The Three Little Pigs"" have helped spreading the rumour. The belief that wolves are dangerous to man is fostered by folklore and in former days children were coerced into behaviour with wolf threats.
Is the wolf really that dangerous? And is it reason enough to annihilate his existence? I do not think so. As far as I know, there are no authentic records of wolves killing humans in Sweden. Actually, the only attack by non-rabid wolves I know of happened in 1968 in Turkey when two men were killed by a wolf pack outside a village. The reason was probably that the wolves, as a result of the deep snow, were mad with hunger. 
Of course the wolf is a big and strong animal with sharp teeth, but it is created that way to bring down preys, not to attack humans. Man is not one of the wolf's natural preys, and since the wolf is very shy and naturally afraid of the human being it is very unusual with attacks. The wolf will not even come close unless he is forced in some way. This has been shown many times. For example when someone approaches the place where a wolf pack feeds on its pray. The natural thing for them to do is to run away as soon as they notice the trespasser, despite the fact that they easily would win a fight.
The most important reason, I think, to protect the wolf in Sweden is that it is needed to maintain the balance in nature. Many people claim that there is no danger to exterminate the wolf since he does not serve an important purpose but it is not true. For example, the wolf functions as a control on the numbers and quality of elks, which feed on the vegetation. As a result the wolves, the elks, and the vegetation thrive in apparent stability. If you remove one member of a biological community, the community becomes unstable, which can get devastating consequences. Studies of the connection between wolves and elks in Isle Royal, Michigan confirm this. The wolf helps maintain the quality of the elk population since it only brings down the less able prey, while sportsmen often shoot the elks with the largest antlers that often also are the most viable ones.
The wolf has for that reason become important in investigations of the ecology of biological communities and especially of the principles of predation. Since the wolf is such an intelligent and socially developed animal with emotional attachments, social order, and complex patterns of expression and communications, it has also become an important subject in other scientific studies such as sociology and psychology. Such studies must be done in the animals' normal surroundings, and not in a zoo.
I agree that wolves also bring some problems. Even though it is very rare that they attack humans, they often attack livestock, and especially reindeer. This is a big problem for the Laplanders in Northern Sweden and nearly impossible to prevent since it is natural for the wolves to attack the easiest prey to catch. But I believe this is something one have to take into account, and the subjected owners do get compensation from the state for their lost cattle. Experiments with electric fences to keep the wolves away from the livestock have been going on for some years and have showed good results.
So why are so many people negative to have a wild wolf strain in Sweden? I guess most of them are afraid. The modern human being has moved so far away from the nature that she no longer can understand it. She wants perfect surroundings without any threats where she can live in happiness. But can one be happy in a perfect but incomplete world? It is time to start saving the wolf before it is too late. It is morally wrong of the human being to decide who is allowed to live and who is not. It is to be hoped that in the future, man will see the wolf as the strong, intelligent and beautiful animal he really is, and admire him instead of being afraid of the bloodthirsty beast that actually does not exist.",0
88,0215.a2.txt,WHY EXERCISE,"It's fairly safe to say that in the fitness fanatic society of today, everyone knows that physical exercise is good for you. We all know that we should exercise. It's a positive thing for people around us; being in good shape signals a character of control and organisation. What I am wondering is if everyone knows why it is good for us, the actual reasons for this fitness frenzy. These reasons have been and still are important to me. They have formed me into who I am today and I want to make other people discover the same satisfying feeling of exercising. The reasons of exercising are seldom discussed and therefore I'd like to highlight a few of them. 
To begin with there is the simplest and most basic reasons why physical exercising is good for you: the well being it brings. This overall well-being is difficult for other activities to compete with, it's incontestable. If one goes to Svettis, plays in the local innebandy team or goes hiking in the forest, the result is the same: physical well being. To explain this rather vague expression ""well-being"" I'd like to use some more scientific terms. If one is in good physical shape the blood count is high. The blood count is a measurement of how much oxygen ones blood contains. The higher blood value the more oxygen it carries. With a high blood count more oxygen reaches the different body parts and that includes the brain. With much oxygen you feel more alert and can do more with less exhaustion. Your brain gets more powerful fuel to think with which makes it quicker. To test this try sleeping one hour less in the morning and use that hour for exercising. You will find out that you actually become more alert from sleeping one hour less instead of being more tired. 
To continue with a reason just as good as anyone, there is the fact that one can with good conscious absorb oneself into one of life's greatest pleasures, eating. Physical activity makes the metabolism rise which enables you to eat more. Since I value eating and really thinks it is a pleasure I would eat a lot even if I didn't exercise. It's not a question of how many kilos I weigh but more the incomparable satisfying hunger I get when having exercised. This real hunger makes you enjoy the food in a different way. It tastes better, and you really feel satisfied after you've eaten. This I believe can be something to think about in relation to the problem of anorexia in society of today. The people suffering from eating disorders often feels quilt after having eaten. Exercising may be a way to treat these disorders by teaching to eat without guilt.
So, one can eat more and have a great feeling of well being if exercising, but that's not all. In my situation as a student there's even a greater argument for exercising: it makes me study better. As I've stated above, being in good shape makes the brain works better. How? The ability to concentrate improves and sharpens. One gets more done in a shorter time. An argument I often encounter is the fact that exercising takes lots of time. It's true that it does but I argue that one wins back all this time in quality. I would like to put it like this: there's an exchange of quantity for quality. The quantity of time that I would spend over a book of social science can be, let's say, 3 hours. If I'm in a good physical shape I could get the same amount of learning done in 2 hours because of quality learning. I can be more concentrated and alert while reading and I remember more in less time. My brain simply works better.
I hope that with this small reminder will make people think twice the next time someone brings up the fitness issue in a conversation. Exercising can change your life, it is not a question of appearance or being in fashion but a tool to a greater life. A (hopefully) longer life filled with joyous moments at the dining table and productive hours at the writing desk.",0
89,0216.a2.txt,NA,"At first I thought it sounds like a brilliant idea: to let unemployed people with unemployment benefit do unpaid work in the public sector. It would be great if people with unemployment benefits could go out and be helpful in the public sector. They are really needed there, for example in hospitals or in daycare centers witch both are very undermanned. The unemployed would do something for their allowance and they would be able to feel that they were doing something valuable with their time. To feel this, I think, is very important for a human being. I think it is important to have something to do during the days to feel good, to feel important. Today the authorities solve this by letting unemployed people join projects like ALU. This suggestion by letting unemployed people help in the public sector is a nice thought, but I do not believe it is the best way of solving the problem of unemployment in Sweden. It is a simple solution for a very complicated problem and solves only the problem in a short time perspective and it is not a good alternative to the projects that are now for the unemployed people.
For the first, if unemployed people with unemployment benefit should help in the public sector it demands a very complicated system, witch I'm quite sure is impossible to create. This system would set out people were needed and wanted and it requires enough places as there are unemployed. Because otherwise, who should have the right to a place and who shouldn't? And what if wrong people showed up at the wrong place, for example people that don't like children get to work in a daycare center. That situation wouldn't be good for anybody. That leads me to the next question: who should decide were the unemployed would be placed? Should it be the authorities or the unemployed? I can't see witch way is the best. If the authorities decide, it could end up with the wrong person at the wrong place, and then the purpose would be gone. If the unemployed would be able to choose he/she would be able ""work"" with something that interests him/her. This sounds good, but what if several people want the same place: who will get it, and on what basis? Maybe this opportunity in choosing could lead to that these people became uninterested in getting a ""real"" job and not be a working unemployed. I can't really see the difference between these situations, the unemployed have a job to go to and they are getting paid for it. 
The idea of this suggestion is that the unemployed would do unpaid work for their unemployment benefit. This amount could be to low, or to high, for the job they are doing in the public sector. I think that there is a risk that this people could be exploited and taken advantage of at the place of work. What exactly would their job look like? The job should not be the same as the people who work there and have an education for it. These ""real-employed"" should be the one with the responsibility, it should not be the unemployed people. Who would decide how the unemployed person's job would look like: the authorities, the place of work, or the unemployed person?
A third argument for not having this system is what will happen to these people later. Should these people be considered as employed or unemployed people; they have a work but on the same time they don't. I'm afraid of that this group of people would be to good labor, and that the authorities wouldn't do so much more to provide a ""real"" job for these people. Another aspect in this is why would the public sector hire any people when they have this less expensive labor? If the public sector don't hire any more people, then this suggestion is bad for the unemployment situation.
I don't believe that this suggestion makes it better for the unemployed in Sweden. I don't believe in a good system, the working unemployed people are becoming cheap labor and I can't see that this suggestion in any way decreases the unemployment, on the contrary I think it creates fewer jobs than without this system. There are too many questions that I can't find any satisfying answers to. I think that this solution is to walk around the problem with blinkers. It would not be a solution for the future, if we don't want a future were work is working like an unemployed? I know I don't want that.",0
90,0218.a2.txt,The elderly - an issue for the state,"Some people think that the family, not the state, should look after the elderly. The reasons are often emotional. To look after your parents and relatives feel like an obligation because they have raised you. I do not believe that taking care of the elderly at home is possible in our society today. In this essay I am going to describe the situation for the elderly in Sweden at present and discuss why I believe that the state, not the family, should look after the elderly.
Most of the elderly in Sweden today live at home and finance it with their pension that they acquire from the state each month. The pension is based on the persons income from the working years. Some of the aged that live at home receive help from community workers a couple of times a week, with for example shopping, cooking, cleaning etc. The elderly who needs help more often, but can manage some things by themselves, live at blocks of service flats where there are medical staffs twenty-four hours a day. There are also nursing homes for those who require help all the time. The blocks of service flats and the nursing homes are both financed by fees and taxes.
The alternative to nursing homes and blocks of service flats is that families nurse their elderly at home. I do not believe that this is possible to accomplish as the only alternative. Nursing someone at home requires more money, time and space than the family can afford. Today families need two incomes to maintain standard. If one of the workers instead stay home nursing, the family will loose a lot of money. There are subsidies that relatives can receive from the state but the fees are low and are limited in time. The whole Swedish well-fare system would have to change if it should be possible for low-income earners to look after their elderly at home. Even if the economy of the family allows nursing at home, there will be a lack of time. It is more than a full-time job taking care of someone twenty-four hours a day. It also demands space. The family has to sacrifice a great deal.
It is often taken for granted that the best care is received by relatives. However the nursing homes and other institutions have, according to me, superior knowledge and resources which provide the best care. That knowledge and resources can never be accomplished at home. There are always several staff members to help the elderly at institutions. There are different types of staff: nurses, doctors, physiotherapists etc, to complement each other. The knowledge of the staff makes it possible to prevent unexpected incidents. Another advantage with institutions in contrast to nursing at home is that living is adjusted for example beds, stairs, doors etc. There are also more means in institutions. It is possible to have means at home transcripted by the occupational therapist. But it would be a major expense for the state if everybody used this benefit.
Finally I can establish the fact that the Swedish system is working quite well. We all want to look after our relatives and the best way to do that are by paying our taxes and fees. At nursing homes and other institutions the elderly receive the best possible care. The staff is well educated and the living is adjusted. If anything happens the help is there immediately. At home we can not provide that safety. It is impossible for the family to give equal care because of the lack of money and time. Of course some families can give their elderly the best care at home, but it demands a lot of effort. I wonder if it isn't the best to let the educated staff take care of the elderly and visit them often, rather then to wear yourself out nursing them. We all want to remember our relatives with happiness, not see them as a burden. The Swedish well-fare system can of course be improved. The state should aim at the same standard at all institutions all over the country. It is hard in these saving times but the elderly have once invested in us. Now it is time for us to pay back and invest in the elderly!",0
91,0219.a2.txt,MOBILE TELEPHONES: a disturbing invention,"A couple of years ago when I came back to Sweden, after having lived abroad for some time, I found that an explosion had taken place. I'm talking about the mobile phone explosion. An explosion which is described to be ""connecting people"", but I think it's doing the opposite thing, splitting people up. I find that these mobile phones are both disturbing, unhealthy and a pathetic status symbol.

One of the things that disturbs me the most about mobile phones is that their owners never seem to know how or when to turn them off. If you're in the library, in class or in a restaurant, you can always be sure that you'll hear a beep form a mobile phone soon. It seems that wherever you are you can't avoid these terrible machines. Nowadays there's also a mobile phone commercial in the cinemas saying: ""Please use our phones, but turn them off when you're at the cinema"". I was also very puzzled, once when I was out for walk, and suddenly a man beside me starts talking very loud. At first I thought he was talking to me and I wanted to answer him. After staring at him for a while I realized that he had some kind of earphones in his ears and that they probably were connected to his mobile phone. The situation could have developed into an embarrassing one. It's not enough that we, who don't have mobile phones, have to put up with embarrassing situations like the one mentioned and the disturbing noise they're making. We are also financially affected by these phones, because we have to dial these expensive mobile phone numbers, if our friends don't have any other phones. I think it's a terrible development.

Mobile phones are not only disturbing; they can also be extremely unhealthy. For example if you're using your phone while driving a car and suddenly the person you're talking to starts screaming or gives you an unexpected message, perhaps you can't control how you drive and as a consequence you put lives in danger. Medical examinations have also shown that people are injured by the radiation that mobile phones are emitting. People are loosing their hair around the area where they're holding the phone and all kinds of other injuries are also connected to the use of mobile telephones. I think that having one of those phones would cause me a lot of stress. Another thing to carry around and look after, another bill to pay and another thing to remember, is also to learn when and where to turn it off. Is it not also very stressful never to be left alone; always having to be reached.

The phenomenon always to be available, if you're in town or if you're in the city, was a sign of status at the beginning of the use of mobile phones. Only a few people had them and they were fairly expensive. Now though everybody has them, they're not particularly expensive and I think that the development is going towards the understanding that it's not very nice having to be reached all the time and always having a machine ringing in your pocket. I've actually heard about company managers, who don't use mobile phones anymore. You have to call their secretaries and make an appointment if you want to see them. So now it's not very cool anymore (if it ever was) to stand in the street with a phone in your hand. In a couple of years maybe nobody wants to show that they have a mobile phone.

In conclusion could be said that I know that it can be good to have a mobile phone in certain situations, like when your car brakes down and you're in the middle of nowhere. In my point of view the bad things are more numerous than the good, but there are things to do to improve the disadvantages with mobile phones. There are actually soundless phones that vibrate instead of making that awful sound. There should be a law, forbidding people to use their phones while driving. To avoid the radiation one should only use the phone in extreme cases, for example to get an ambulance to the scene of an accident. The fact that people think that mobile phones are signs of wealth will perhaps, as it seems, go away by itself.",0
92,0221.a2.txt,Use your brain use a helmet,"A bicycle is a cheap and excellent means of transport that takes you anywhere you like. It is not harmful to the environment as cars are and it is good for your health and it is an economical advantage to use as many people have discover over the years when prices on petrol is increasing. There is one thing though that not many of the cyclists have discovered, the cycle-helmet. It is an excellent protection and it is a cheap life insurance in case of an accent. The cycle-helmet is something all cyclists should wear, not just our little ones.
When our little ones is about to learn cycling we teach them to wear a cycle-helmet as a protection in case of an accident on the staggering ride. That is what every protecting parent do to their children. But the children get older and they start to protest against wearing the cycle-helmet. Maybe it is just because that their friends do not wear one or, even worse, their parents do not. The question is why don't the parents wear a helmet themselves? Maybe it is because they claims that they know how to rid a bicycle and therefor will not be involved in an accident, or, as I have heard objections as, that a cycle-helmet will ruin their hairstyle. I admit that the hairstyle will be ruined by wearing a helmet. And most of the grown-ups know how to ride a cycle. But when do one know there should be an accident? And what is a ruined hairstyle in comparison with a destroyed life by an accident A cycle-helmet is a protection, which all cyclists ought to wear. We know that children not always do as they are told, they usually do as you do, whether you like it or not. So the best way to make them wear a cycle-helmet is to wear one yourself, despite of a ruined hairstyle.
 In spite of the fact that the bicycle is an excellent means of transport the cyclist is the only road-user that is totally unprotected in traffic. The driver is safe in his or her car, which have all the latest safety equipment as safety belt and airbags. The cyclist's only protection is a cycle-helmet. The National Road Safety Office has through the years had information campaign to pursued people wear a cycle-helmet. There have been film commercials and advertising bill all over the country about this matter We have had many chances to learn by this information that the head is the most fragile part of one's body and one single knock on the head can change ones life forever. A skull injury can mean everything from personality change to disturbance of balance, speech disorders or the worse, the death. But there are still a large numbers of people who are not wearing a helmet. Some of them are of the opinion that they look silly wearing one. Maybe it is not the prettiest headgear but it serves its purpose. If the adults set up a good example, to all children and start to wear a cycle-helmet in traffic it will turn out to be a self-evident thing to wear. Like it is with the safety belt, everyone use it now without any objections. Statistic shows that most of the cyclists that are injured in traffic suffers from skull injuries and if they had wear a cycle-helmet the injuries wouldn't had been that seriously.
 Why people does not wear a helmet after the information campaigns that have been run by the National Road Safety Office through the years are a mystery to me. It is time to ignore that you may lock silly in a cycle-helmet and that the hairstyle will be ruined as long as it may save your life. It is your only protection in traffic. And the unnecessary high cost of medical treatment could be spent on more important matters.",0
93,0222.a2.txt,Whay do not people listen?,"We have a big environmental problem in the world today. The tempo, at which we are using the Earth's natural resources, is currently far to fast for effective control or thoughtful management. Control is especially needed in three areas: 1) hunting, 2) Deforestation, and 3) Water pollution. The environment is changing at a rate that is slipping from our control. When you speak about this, you often hear comments like, ""you are so negative, we have always dumped things in the oceans, and people in Africa needs the ivory trade to survey"". I agree that we should be able to use nature resources. In South America we have the big cotton fields and coffee fields, but is it right to cut down trees and kill animals for financial interests?

Attempts have been made over the years to stop rustlers and protecting endangered animals, such as Gorillas, Rhinos, and Elephants. Many of these efforts have been ineffective and more frightening still, some restrictions are even being lifted or removed, leaving the animals once again unprotected. One example of this is the Ivory trade in several African countries. A few weeks ago, the United Nations announced that several countries in Africa are allowing the ivory trade again, after many years of restrictions. The restrictions were an attempt to protect the few African elephants that had survived the ruthless hunt by rustlers. For many years the African elephants have manage to increase in numbers, but according to distinguished scientists, such as Cynthia Moss, they have not fully recovered. Elephants are still endangered, and will probably be extinct in about five years, if the ivory trade starts again. The governments in Africa will not be able to keep the ivory trade in organised forms. Rustlers will kill all elephants in their way to get the ivory.

A second threat to Earth's ecosystem comes from deforestation. Deforestation not only kills the plants and animals that live in the forests, but has far-reaching effects on the global climate.We are cutting down the rain forest not knowing all the animals living there. A soccer field of trees is disappearing every minute, every day. The forest is necessary for our survival, not only because of the oxygen that it provides us, but also because of its absorption of pollution. The lack of the forest also gives us climate changes, increasing numbers of El Ninos and El Ninas have been registrated. Temperatures rise, the ice at the North and South Pole's begin to calf. Calving at the Northpole is displacing the gulfstream, and indirect giving us a colder climate in the north of Europe, and a warmer climate in the south of Europe. The green house effect has not only raised the temperature on the planet, but has also been linked to incidence of skin cancers. 

Water pollution is a third behaviour desperately in need of regulation.For the whole century, big corporations have been dumping toxic waste in the oceans. This waste is killing all kinds, of sea mammals and fish. Unfortunately it is cheaper to dispose the waste this way than to rebuild the factories, or recycle the waste. The polluted water provides us food. Are we just going to accept that the salmon we eat is full of mercury? The toxics that we eat through the polluted food are known to cause cancer and other diseases.

The things that I have described are not a bedtime story. The facts that scientists report have not significantly altered our attitude toward the resources of the world. The problem is that people do not listen, or do they not care? We can not ignore these issues. But what could change peoples attitude? My attitude changed when I read about these problems and relacied that I could make a different by choosing what products I would like to buy. You can do it to and please do; it is needed to save the Earth.There is an old Indian saying: "" We have not inherited the earth from our parents; we are just borrowing it from our children"".",0
94,0223.a2.txt,Why the selling of JAS to South Africa is such a step back for humanity,"I am going to discuss the Swedish government's policies concerning war materiel export and demonstrate why it is not morally defensible of Sweden to export to a country like South Africa. Sweden is the country with the most restricted export policy concerning war materiel in the world but is still exporting like there were no regulations. The war materiel in question is the aircraft fighter JAS 39 Gripen. The Swedish government hopes to sell fifteen of them to South Africa. In return, several Swedish companies will invest in the country, build new factories and employ lots of people
According to Swedish and European law, export of war materiel is not recommended to a country in which human rights are being violated. In South Africa, during 1997, many cases of police violence were reported. Among accusations, were alleged torture, abuse and rapes inside prison walls. As many as one hundred and thirty four suspicious deaths were investigated, and one hundred and fifty guards were arrested for assaulting 155 internees so severely that they needed medical care. Unfortunately, the prison doctor denied them their right of medical attention. I would call this situation a clear violation against human rights. 
Another guideline to either sell or not sell war materiel is if a country suffers with internal armed disturbances, or not. Everybody knows that South Africa is politically unstable, with high criminal density, and with wide spread access to weapons. More than nine hundred people died between 1996 and 1998 because of armed conflicts.
The third reason when not to export war materiel, has to do with if the recipients economic- and social development is at risk, by going through with a deal of this dignity. South Africa is a recipient of Swedish financial aid, and should not according to Swedish regulations be financially strong enough to buy JAS 39 Gripen, without jeopardising the economic and social growth in the country.
As a fourth argument restraining Swedish export, is if a purchase could effect regional peace and security. It does not take a genius to realise what it would mean to the African continent, if South Africa were to buy JAS 39 Gripen. South Africa's defence is the biggest and most advanced in the entire Africa. Their military expenditure, 2,506 million US dollars, is second only to Egypt. There are no immediate threats, but the neighbouring countries could take offence, and a regional rearmament would be a fact. It makes me think of last summer and the tension between the countries of China, India and Pakistan. Tension caused by nuclear tests. I have to admit I was a little frightened for a while. I know those nuclear missals serve as means to keep the super powers in the world in balance, but I do not trust the men in charge of such powers. Men have a history of making bad decisions. 
I got really upset when I heard that Sweden is telling the South African side, that a purchase of the fighter aircraft would benefit the South African democratic development. I think it is outrageous that the Swedish government can talk about exporting war materiel and democracy in the same sentence. Money should be better spent by investments in food, medicine, housing and job opportunities. When I explained my standpoint to a friend of mine, he said that if we did not sell JAS to South Africa, some other country would and Sweden would lose a profitable deal. I am sure he is right, but I do not think we should go a head and do something so profoundly wrong as to sell JAS and thereby risk a peaceful future for Africa. I do not care if South Africa would buy a fighter from another country if Sweden would back out of the deal. At least our conscious would be clear. Two wrongs do not necessarily make a right. Sweden should instead serve as a role model. I hate to think I live in a country where profits are more important than human rights, values and quality of life. 
Sweden has in the last three decades, in spite of its restrictive export policy, sold a lot of war materiel to countries in war like Singapore, India, Malaysia, Pakistan and Yugoslavia among others. The Swedish export of war materiel 1994 fetched 3,2 billion Swedish crowns. I think the signals we are sending out from Europe to the third world, as well as the fourth, are terrifying. We are making it harder for refugees and immigrants to enter any country in the EU and at the same time lessen our financial aids to their countries. It is a terrible double standard on the Swedish part. We used to work for solidarity. Where is that solidarity now?
 My fear is that the men in charge in Europe might have some devious plan to eliminate the third and fourth world by letting them kill themselves in war with each other, with weapons bought from Europe for a lot of money. Call me paranoid but these racist tendencies are frightening me. Sweden should instead work for disarmament support human rights.",0
97,0227.a2.txt,The necessity of a Swedish national defence,"In this essay I will be discussing the need for an active Swedish national defence. I'm fully aware of the complexity of this area and therefore I will focus on a couple of the main points in this debate, more specifically those for and against further cuts in the national defence budget. I have selected three arguments against an expensive national defence and I will try to prove them wrong by presenting some essential counter-arguments. The arguments I'm going to deal with are: The idea that international relations today are so good that war is unthinkable, the idea that national defence is not cost-effective and finally the proposed solution to these problems: the idea of rebuilding a defence force when necessary.

The possibly most important argument against a Swedish national defence is that the political situation abroad and our relationship to foreign powers prevent the eventuality of war, at least in the foreseeable future. Sweden has not been directly involved in a war for a couple of centuries and the possibility of such an event is considered very remote. What has been forgotten in this argument is that war is very difficult to predict. In the modern world, the intentions of other nations are not always clear and they can change from friendly to hostile in no time. Today's international relations are not very stable, especially not after the end of the Cold War. An alert nation shouldn't be tricked into the ""post-war-calm"" mentality Sweden has today.

After World War One, it was argued all over Europe that no more wars could follow after such a horrendous one. Most nations ignored to maintain a capable defence force and the results of this ignorance are well known today. Another important point is that war has a tendency to affect larger geographical areas today than before, mainly because of the increased capacity of mass-destruction weapons. Surely, Sweden can't possibly stay out of a conflict between, for example the U.S. and Russia, because such a conflict will be world-wide.

Another argument that has gained much in influence these days is that the national defence is a state expense that isn't cost-effective. A lot of money is spent each year on training, weapon-systems and maintenance but society doesn't benefit from these activities and purchases. Indeed, it is hard to point out exactly what we are protecting ourselves from, if it is necessary and why it should be so expensive. I'd like to compare this spending to the one you do on your insurance every year. You wouldn't even dream of not paying to protect yourself from robberies, accidents or other minor disasters, so why shouldn't the nation protect itself from the most devastating disaster of all - war? I'm sure you'll agree that a couple of millions each year is a low sum to pay considering what you are preventing; war often comes just as suddenly and unpredictably as a fire or a car-accident.

The final argument I'd like to discuss isn't actually an argument, but more a practical solution to today's defence-budget problems that has been influenced by the anti-defence arguments mentioned above. Today large parts of the defence forces are cut down permanently, a considerable part of those remaining are ""put to sleep"" and are not to be revitalised until it is necessary, that is in case of a war being imminent. Can you do this to a national defence force and still maintain the effectiveness that has been achieved in years of training and improvement? I'd say no, you can't. First of all, it takes several years to create a functioning army unit. A brigade (a unit of about 5,000 men), for example, takes some seven years to train. It is not very often that you can start training for a war several years ahead, mainly because you can't predict it. It would also take several years for the industry to adjust and build all the equipment necessary that we don't build today. This ""solution"" to the problems of the national defence today seems to me nothing but a desperate and irresponsible way to increase national funds.

As a conclusion I'd like to point out that most of the arguments against a Swedish national defence are not very concerned with the actual safety of the nation, they seem to be more concerned about how much money can be saved by not investing in a national defence. It is very sad to see that the government of today makes hasty decisions in order to increase funds, decisions which we may have to regret in the future.",0
98,0231.a2.txt,Speciesism -The racism against animals,"This essay will show you why we ought to treat animals not as means to our own ends but as ends in them selves. I will start by giving you an explanation to why our attitudes towards animals are the way they are. After this I will reject two of the most common arguments of why we need and have the right to use animals as means. Finally I will give a superior argument which will force you to accept the fact that we have no right exploiting animals just to satisfy our own pleasures. I will plea for reason and logic, but this will not be sufficient if you are not ready to change your own attitudes. A person's attitudes have a tendency to overrun logic and reason, so please have an open mind, and think of what I just said.
With this in mind, consider women's position in history. In the late 1800's women were men's possession and no one questioned this. In fact, Thomas Aquino said that 'a female is a defect male', and he was one of the greatest thinkers in the history of mankind. Those were the facts, the truth those days, just as it is a fact nowadays that animals do not have any rights to claim towards humans. The same parallel could be drawn between the black slaves and the animal's situation today. What I want to say is that after every liberation movement people talk about it as 'the last remaining form of discrimination'. You should be very wary of talking about 'the last remaining form of discrimination' because, as I have shown, there are always some group of living creatures still being discriminated. Yesterday it was sexism and racism, today it is speciesism. What we today consider morally justified may tomorrow be regarded as a great injustice.
I assume you can not argue against this historical fact, and hence you have to admit that our attitudes today just might be immoral. The strength in my argumentation so far could, to some extent, be questioned if humans needed animals to survive, which is one of the most frequent arguments coming from speciesists. I agree there would be no immoral in killing animals and eating them in order to survive, but in many parts of the world this is not necessary, including our own. We can very well get all the nutritious substances we need from vegetables, different substitutes and additional vitamins. This argument is therefore rejected on basis of its incorrectness. Could the speciesist defend his position in another way than the statement that humans need animals to survive? Let us consider the second of the most frequent arguments given in favour of speciesism. It claims we have the right to use animals as means to our own ends, when it is, at the same time, claiming we do not have the right to discriminate women and black people. It goes something like this: 'Women and blacks are members of our own species, animals are not, hence we have the right to exploit animals'. If the first argument failed on basis of incorrectness this argument fails on the basis of both relevance and logic. If we discriminate animals just because they are animals, we might as well discriminate women because they are women, and black people just because they are black. This is called sexism and racism. We can not discriminate any living creature on the basis of characteristics such as sex, skin colour, intelligence or species affiliation. The question we need to find an answer to is: What is the one capability humans and non-humans share? This question is answered by the Supreme argument, crushing any possible argument defending speciesism.
Any living creature possessing the capability of having feelings of pleasure and pain, has the right of not being used as means but always as ends'. This is the Supreme argument. On the basis of this, it should be quite obvious why speciesism is wrong, why we do not have the right to use animals as food-machines or experimenting on them. Even if the two arguments in favour of speciesism somehow could be defended, this argument could not be rejected. It is as simple as that.
We now have a complete logical reasoning rejecting the speciesism in our society. The only obstacle now is your own attitudes. It may take some time to change them, and that is all right. The important thing is that you hopefully have started to reflect on your moral values, and eventually you will no longer find yourself on the side of the oppressors.",0
99,0232.a2.txt,To live in a student hostel,"How can you live in a student hostel? My old friends often ask me this question. They just don't understand how I, since I have lived in different flats and houses on my own or together with my boyfriend of that time for almost ten years, can stand to live in a small room among so many unknown people. But I think there are several strong reasons why I have chosen to live in a student hostel.
First, it's very economic if you compare with living in your own flat. You pay less a month and the rent includes costs for electricity - no extra expense for that. The best of all is that you get two month free rent - in June and July you don't have to pay anything. The money you save you can spend on a lovely holiday instead. Those who live in their own flats of course have to pay rent for every month. But if they want to save their money, since many students take the opportunity to go home and live at their parent's house, they have to give notice of removal from their flat. And then during the summer they have to spend time in searching for a new flat since they can't be sure of removing to their earlier flat. Because of there are few available flats it may even be difficult to find a new one. I don't have these problems since I can afford to keep my room in the student hostel. Another economic reason is that because of you are twelve persons who live in the student hostel, you can also save money in newspapers and TV expenses - you just split the expenses in twelve.
Next, you will get a lot of friends when you live in a student hostel. Since there are twelve persons who live together you will always find someone that you will get along with and maybe it will be the beginning of a life-long friendship. Those who live in a flat often lives alone or have to share it with one or two persons that they really have to cope with, otherwise it will be very tough. Though there are a bigger chance to make friendships in a student hostel since there are more persons to chose between. My old friends often wonder if not the friendships will be too tight and if I will be left alone. But if I want to be alone I just close my door. Of course I can sometimes hear my friends from outside but it can be a similar insufficiently soundproof if you have a flat of your own. Since you know your neighbours you will even feel more secure. I remember when I lived alone in a house on the countryside, I slept with my golf club next to me, in case someone unknown would come and visit me in the middle of the night. Now that is not necessary.
At last, it's much easier to keep your room and the shared kitchen tidy. Since you live in only one room it doesn't take that much time to tidy - for me it only takes about half an hour a week. Earlier when I lived in a big house or a flat I spend many hours on tidying - time that I now can spend in more important matters like studying and training. The shared kitchen, with respect to my neighbours, makes me washing up the dishes at once. Earlier my dishes could be left for a week. When you finally move out from your student hostel you don't have to do the time-wasting and boring work in cleaning the oven, the ventilator and the freezer. You just have to clean your own room, which of course is much easier.
Thus, it's easy to see why I have chosen to live in a student hostel. Many people see this kind of living as temporary. They just live in the student hostel for a short time meanwhile they search for a flat of their own. But I promise that I will live in my student hostel as long as I will study here in Uppsala because of all the advantages and since this kind of living suits me perfectly well.",0
100,0234.a2.txt,A concert hall - a matter of course,"There can be very few citizens of Uppsala who have not heard or read about the debate of later years about the building of a concert hall in the centre of the town. Sadly, the discussion has been going on for decades without any signs from the municipal council of Uppsala of seeing the advantages in such a project. I strongly believe that we need a proper concert hall and think that it is very strange that we have not got one when far smaller towns, like G√§vle, have. Undoubtedly, Uppsala with its well - established reputation of a rich and flourishing music life is risking to lose it if nothing is done soon.
To here list the many musical activities in Uppsala would take up a great deal of space, but we have about 250 choirs, among them OD who has frequently being hailed as the best male choir in the world, and pop- rock- and jazzgroups ( too numerous to count) just to mention some of them. However, these activities just as any other form of culture, especially the performing arts, can only exist on physical conditions, and the situation today is that there is a shortage of rehearsal rooms as well as performance halls. Of course famous and wealthy societies like OD have their own premises but the small ones have to work hard to find any. Until now many small and independent choirs have been given permission to rehearse in churches but since the state and the church have been separated this has become more difficult. Moreover, the only two premises we have for bigger concerts, orchestral work for example, are the University Hall and the Fyrishov sports hall, both with terribly bad acoustic properties and none of them built for the purpose of performing music. In other words, there is a general demand for a concert hall, and even if the building of one would not be profitable we should support it. From an idealistic point of view, culture is good in itself and an essential part of our lives which must be subsidized. 
However, contrary to what many people think, the building of a concert hall in all probability would be economically profitable in the long run. Studies in Germany have proven that cities which invest in culture improve the situation on the labour market and improve the city's economy in broad outline. This applies to Uppsala as well. A good concert hall would be a good advertisement for our town, and people from other cities who would come here to go to concerts would also spend money on other lines of business, namely hotels, shops and restaurants. Furthermore, big companies tend to invest in cultural events, through sponsorships, to get advertisement, and if they are going to move the business they seem to chose cities with a cultural profile. As I already have mentioned, this is all profitable in the long term, and to avoid heavy expences in the beginning it is possible to build the hall with the Nanna school as the base as have been suggested several times before. 
Apart from being a place for musical performances and rehearsals, the concert hall could also serve an academic and commersial purpose. Every year Uppsala University organizes several conferences and one of them, which I worked at, was a scientific assembly held in the summer of 1997. It comprised more than 1300 participants and would definitely have needed another big lecture hall. For non-academic conferences and meetings, available premises today are one only; the Atrium hall. It does seem obvious that increased supply would increase the demand, and the nearness to Arlanda would make Uppsala even more attractive.
To sum up, the current situation bears no proportion to the musical life in Uppsala and have a restraining influence on the young generation of musicians. Only a rudimental knowledge of the practising of music leads to the conclusion that Uppsala is in immediate need of a concert hall, and the fact that it would not have a negative effect on the municipal economy, rather the contrary, makes it even more difficult to understand why we still lack one.",0
101,0235.a2.txt,Abolish day nursery for children under four.,"The situation of the parents and the children of today is precarious. The parents are working so much that they feel insufficient for their family. At young age, children are left at the day nursery several hours and therefore not feeling loved. The current situation of Swedish day nurseries is a shame. As it is today all day nurseries for children under the age of four ought to be closed. Day nurseries are so crowded that no real pedagogic activity is possible. Children of this age group are particularly sensible because they need one main person to turn to. Today an employee has not got enough time to give proper attention to each child. In addition the employees are so worn-out that they often need to report themselves sick, and several substitutes come and go. 

There are three main arguments why day nurseries for children under four should be closed. The first has to do with children's need of developing a self-esteem, the second with learning rules to feel safe and the third with their health. 

Small children like to play by themselves therefore they don't really need a lot of children around to play with. They don't understand why they been left and that their parents will come back to pick them up later. Some children believe that they've been abandon forever. Under the circumstances of today's day nurseries no child can develop a good self- confidence. The setting of a personality starts already from the first day of life. To establish a good self-esteem children need to have one adult who's always available. The adult ought to have a clear set of rules and give continuous feedback and interest in the children's behaviour. Having one person to get attached to means that children learns to develop a relationship with another individual. Not having one influence the child negatively for the rest of their life. The capability of dealing with situations later on in life is determined during his or her first three years of life. 

Children need the help of an adult to learn and understand proper social skills and everyday rules. Children who have not yet learned social skills tend to make up their own, particularly if they spend most of their time with children of their own age. Their own way of solving a problem often includes violence. If no adult make the time to teach them alternative ways of communication, children can go on becoming socially disabled up in high age. Different rules and persons at day nursery and at home can severely confuse small children. To understand the environment makes the individual feel safe. 

The employees at the day nurseries do not have a chance to see to that each child follows their own day rhythm. To eat when hungry and to sleep when tired is important for their health. Small children's immune defence is not yet entirely developed and they are therefore more vulnerably to diseases. Being continuously exposed to several illnesses, being tired and staying in humid buildings has a negative influence on their health. Many children develop different kinds of allergies under these conditions. 

Suggestions how to make it financially possible for one parent to stay at home with their children are many. If the Government would close down all day nurseries for children under four there would be some money to replace. That money should be used to pay the parents. Parents who are staying home from work should continue to get the same ATP* as if they were working. The first three years of minding the parents should also get maintenance payment grounded on their working salary. Single parents should however have the possibility to send their children to a day nursery. Their children would gain from this solution also because the day nurseries wouldn't then be as crowded as they are today. Special laws would have to be passed to make it smoother for the parents to return to the labour market. 

The whole society would gain from this solution. Parents would know their children better and the children would become more self-confident and have fewer tendencies to use violence. Better relationships mean fewer divorces and fewer crimes. The health of many children and future adults would also improve.

102,0236.a2.txt,"The family, not the state, should look after the elderly","My family means the world to me, especially my grandmother. She is soon to be eighty-nine years old and she is without doubt the healthiest, most spirited and alert eighty-nine year old I have ever met. 
Six days a week a woman from a home for aged people comes and visits her. She tidies up and vacuum-cleans my grandmother's flat and does her laundry. She also brings my grandmother the food she needs, so she does not have to do anything that could be dangerous to or jeopardize her health. 
Her husband, my grandfather, recently died, and our whole family were convinced that she would be terribly miserable living on her own, with no one to talk to during the day. 
My mother and her brother were worried that they would be forced to decide whether to put grandmother in a home for elderly or to let her live with one of them. Unfortunately, none of them were happy about the possibility that their mother should live in one of their homes. 
I felt overcome with anger and rage against their attitudes, but I realized that there were not much I could do about it.
Surprisingly, my grandmother was very determined when she told us that she would rather die than to be put in an institution, as she called it. Neither did she want to intrude upon her daughter's and son's family life and she rejected the offer to live with either of them. 
I actually think that she was more anxious about her own privacy than the fact that she was going to intrude on our. My family is lucky to have such a vital grandmother, but not everyone is so fortunate as we are. 
The most important issue, when it comes to elderly care, is the question whether to take care of the older and let them stay home with the family, or to let the state look after them. 
It was not my place to tell my mother what was right or wrong in her attitude against elderly care, but I know that I could never put my parents in those ""institutions"". I guess I would be forced to, if they were ill and could not cope on their own. But if the they would stay healthy, that is, if they would not need hospital care, and just were too old to cook and clean and shop for groceries, I would certainly let them live with me. The house might be a bit crowded, but I prefer a crowded house, than a crowded home for aged people.
I think the family bonds are extremely significant and important for the human race and for life itself and I would do anything to keep my family intact. I also think that it is quite important for the youth of today to live with and among the older generation. 
As a none-practising teacher, I still have met hundreds of young students that are very disrespectful towards their parents and towards older people. I am convinced, that if every family let the old members live with them, sharing their lives and ideals, the world would be a much better place.
Young ones today, hardly see their grandparents, but for perhaps three times a year. That is a shame. Old people have experienced a great deal and are full of valuable knowledge that they can, hopefully, influence the young with. There are a too wide gap between the youth and the elderly today and I strongly feel that this situation has to change. 
If we let our older family members live with the rest of the family, I am sure that the violence that are spreading among youths in Sweden today, would decrease radically. 
I have only mentioned the advantages the younger generation could experience when and if they live with older people, but I think the elderly also can experience more happiness sharing their lives with the young members in the family. That is, they can feel useful when they take part of the interaction between family members.
Life is fragile and so are family bonds. It is of great importance to keep those bonds strong and fresh. Therefore it is far beyond my ability to comprehend that some people prefer to put their old ones in homes for aged people, rather than taking care of them themselves.",0
103,0237.a2.txt,"One could argue that the Monarch does not have any real political power and is therefore merely to be seen as an ambassador who travels round the world as a representative for his country. But there are many aspects of the monarchicalsystem and even though the Monarch's powers are very limited his or her position as the Head of State is of principal matter. Because the Monarch is given his title by heredity and is consequently not chosen by the people. This is the antithesis to the main thought of democracy, that the power emanates from the people. Another disturbing factor which interferes with the thought that all individuals are equal is that the Monarch historically has been looked upon as a divine ruler, that is a ruler chosen by God. And he does still today in our modern society stand above the grey mass of working- and middle class people. The Monarch is part of and in a way a symbol for the class society which is advancing rapidly. He does not have to prove that he has any kind of qualifications at all for his office. And it takes at least eight years and two votes in the Parliament if a monarch is to be removed from his office.","Sweden has traditionally been a monarchy ruled by a sovereign Monarch. This did not change until the 19th century when Montesquieu's ideas were adopted to the Swedish constitution and the king had to share his powers with the politicians. The question whether a democratic country like Sweden should be a monarchy or not has been increasingly debated throughout the past century and culminated with a reform of the government in 1974. Then it was stated that the Monarch should be Sweden's Head of State. This means that his powers are very limited and mostly of symbolic value. The monarch's greatest power is that he is the first representative for the Swedish defence force and that he holds the highest grades of the defence.


Another aspect that is related to the Monarch's lack of qualifications is the economical part. The grant from the state to the royal household is as much as 37 million kronor each year. This sum is supposed to cover the costs for the Monarch's representation and the 75 persons who are employed by the Earl Marshal office and the divisions for computers, economy and press. Furthermore does the tax payers pay for the Governor office, that is administration of the royal castles and parks, and the Royal Chamber of Household Utensil, which includes administration and preservation of equipment and art collections. These two offices receive about 35 million kronor every year.

The main reason to why a majority of Swedes are in favour of the monarchy is the enormous amount of attention that is paid on the royal family in the press. Members of the royal family are to be seen on the front covers of various magazines and newspapers. But the headlines are not always flattering, whit the scandal press digging deeper and deeper trying to find out anything that presumably would sell. And this not, and has never been, the purpose of the monarchy.

The monarchical system is in many ways archaic and does not have validity in a modern, contemporary and democratic society. It can not be denied that the Monarch has a symbolic value which is of benefit to his country. But this does not mean that this uniting role can not be shouldered by someone else, like the politicians. It would definitely be more democratic if the Prime minister, who is chosen by the people, would be the head of state for the period that he or she is elected. This would open up the possibility for the people to remove a Head of State that does not have the people's symphaties. And the sum of 72 million kronor for the Monarch's costs could be used in sectors like education, health- and elderly care to benefit the whole society.",0
104,0238.a2.txt,Watching TV is bad for children,"TV is a big part of most children's lives. They can watch it almost all the time, in the morning before they go to school, in the afternoon when they come home and in the evening before they go to bed. If there is nothing to watch there is always video. Children do not only watch children's programs. They also watch soap operas and films that were obviously made for adults. All the violence and stereotypes that the soap operas and films contain give the child a false picture of reality. Still there are many people who think that TV is good for children because it makes them creative. Some also think that it helps them to separate good from evil and that for example He-man provides roles to use when playing. TV is even considered essential to children because they learn so much from it. But I say no, TV is bad for children. 

The first reason why it is bad is that TV is not creative and it does not inspire children. In fact it destroys their own free fantasy, limits it and makes the child a passive receiver. Anyone who has experienced a child's creativity and enormous fantasy knows that TV can never compete with that. TV only serves someone else's, often an adult's, fantasy. And then the watcher does not have to imagine anything. All the senses are occupied, so it does not leave any opportunity for the mind to create, to develop itself.

When you read or listen to a story being read to you, you do imagine. We have to use our imagination to picture what we hear. So when children listen to a story about good and evil they will create individual images of the two sides in their minds. And each of these images will be as frightening and thrilling as the child can handle. If they watch TV instead, some of the children will be too frightened and maybe have nightmares, because of what they see. The only memories they will have afterwards are the scary ones and the important message will not have reached them. That is why it is better to learn the difference between good and evil by listening to someone telling a story. That way children get roles to use in their games too, so they do not have to come from TV.

Learning is very popular today. As early as possible the children are taught all they can grasp: reading, writing, the name of flowers, counting. To do that TV is useful. I do not think that this learning is a good thing. The children get enough of that sort of knowledge anyway. What children of today need is a moment of peace. Some time to sit down and ponder all the information they get wherever they go. And some time for themselves to do what they really want to do, or to daydream or to experience life itself. Nobody can argue that TV can teach a child more than life. Can knowledge, received from TV programs and films, ever be real to someone who does not know the world? Can you be an expert of trees if you have never climbed one? I think then our knowledge will only be a gray theory. 

So TV gives children frames, not ideas, for their games. And they do not even need ideas, being a child is being creative and full of ideas. Their own imagination is on their level, they will not become too frightened by a story about good and evil. Unless they see it on TV with its horrifying, realistic pictures. Many parents put their kids in front of the TV because they think it will teach them a lot. But at the same time they take away the opportunity for the child to rest with his/her own thoughts or to discover the world. Now, I do not think that we should ban TV. I just think we should see TV for what it is: entertainment. So that we do not fool ourselves to think it is an essential part of a child's life. We must also choose for them, we are responsible for what they see on TV.",0
105,1002.a2.txt,Our right to live,"The capital punishment is a widely discussed subject. In the EU-countries it is repealed, but in many other countries it still exists,in the USA for example. There are many active humanitarian groups that are fighting against the death penalty, Amnesty is only one of them. To sentence anyone to death is actually against the human rights, and that should be acknowledged by the entire world. There are no facts proving that the punishment of death prevents crimes. I think it only gives a false feeling of security, that something has been made about the problem. But one major point is being neglected: the right to live. The basic right to live is what makes me completely against the death penalty. No person has the right to take another person's life. For me it's as simple as that. A person's right to life is the most fundamental human right. It's an essential value everybody should share. Quite a few people would argue that anyone who has taken another person's life does not deserve to live. Are we any better ourselves if we do the same thing to the murderer then? That would make us killers, even though it would be an act of revenge. It wouldn't even be up to you and me to decide whether the murderer should get the lethal injection or not. A small group of high-ranking people would make the verdict. They have the ability to decide over life. I find that frightening.

On the other hand I have no problem understanding parents who want to see the person who murdered their child killed. Some crimes are so unbelievably cruel and revolting that you would like to do something about it yourself. I know that if a member of my family became a victim of a brutal felon, I would want that person to get severely punished. As a matter of fact, I would do anything to make the criminal suffer from what he/she has done. I'm sure that I wouldn't even mind seeing that person dead, but not because of a legal action. No laws should be made about people's right to live! A person may deserve to die, but nobody has the right to kill him/her.

But it is impossible to overlook the fact that more and more people are supporting the capital punishment. It could be a sign of that the society is tired of the widespread criminality. People want to see changes in the legal system. They want the courts to get stricter and the police to deal with the problems in a tougher way. But death penalty is not the solution. As written above, there are no evidence f a connection between the death penalty and lesser crimes being committed. And is it really worth the risk of killing someone who could be innocent? If to be locked away for the rest of their lives doesn't scare people from committing crimes, to threaten with death sentence won't help either.

I would say that deprivation of liberty is a very hard punishment. A person sentenced to life imprisonment certainly isn't a happy one. Imagine a life completely controlled by others. It's nothing but a living nightmare. Constantly surrounded by inspecting eyes you eat, sleep and go outside at the same time of the day, every day, day after day after day... And add to that the guilt you carry on your shoulders. You have to live the rest of your life knowing that you have ruined several people's lives. Not only your victim's life, but his/her family's aswell. To me that doesn't sound like much of a life. I would say that to be locked away for life is worse than having a needle injected into your arm and slip off into the eternal rest. Then you have to live with what you have done for the remaining part of your life. 

As a result of the arguments I have put forward I hope to convince at least someone of the non-human in deciding over other people's right to live. It's quite clear that I take a stand against the capital punishment. My main argument is obviously that everybody has the right to live, or in other words, that nobody has the right to kill. To kill someone is a crime, and whether I or the state is the murderer is of no importance.",0
106,1003.a2.txt,NA,"When I was five years old and my sister only three, my parents separated. They decided to have joined custody. We should live with both of them, one week at the time. I have always seen this as a good decision. Therefor I was a bit shocked when I read in the morning paper that it is not. According to some experts, it is actually dangerous! Children, who are forced to live like this, are at risk of being unsociable and insecure. Of having trouble with long term relationships and of being unable to see things as part of a greater whole, all according to Torgny Gustavsson, chief physician at the clinic of child psychiatry in V√§xj√∂. This statement made me think. If this is true, what does that make of me? After reading a bit more about this issue, I concluded that the experts were wrong. I believe that the best thing for all children is to, if possible, live with both their parents! In this essay, I will argue this statement with my own experiences as basis and some experts* to support me.
That every child needs both a male and a female role model to develop into proper functioning social creatures, is a recogized fact. The best way to achieve this is, undoubtedly, to have a close relationship with both parents. Therefor it must be preferred to live with both of them. Whether they live together or not is of less importance. In many cases the latter is if anything an advantage. It gives the child the opportunity to really get to know both its parents, in many core families the father takes (or is allowed) little part in the child's upbringing. The separate homes can also provide a smoother relationship between the child and its parents since they do not have to see each other all the time.
According to Gustavsson, only some elitist parents are able to provide a safe environment for their children in two different homes. His suggestion is that the children should live with their mother and see their father as often as possible. I think that he is underestimating the parents. Perhaps they are not the best of friends after a split but as long as they respect, and live reasonably close to, one another I believe that joined custody is the best solution. The parents will grow with the task. They will learn to cooperate for the sake of the children. Furthermore I would argue that [m1]a relationship were the father remains a close parent even when his children live with their mother is very hard to obtain. Researches have shown that the father often becomes a weekend character and than, bit by bit slips away. Gustavsson also shows an old fashioned way of looking at domestic problems. By maintaining that the children preferably should live with their mother, he states that she is always the best parent and the father secondary. In my opinion it is wrong to degrade one or the other, both parents are equally essential to the child's upbringing. Consequently both should take even part in its life.
Although quite a few experts agree with Gustavsson in these matters, none of them has been able to provide any real evidence. Moreover, just as many experts support my case. For instance recent studies at the University of √ñrebro show that children commuting between their parents are very happy about it. They do not show any signs of being insecure or unsociable. On the contrary. Several studies in the United States show that those children get stronger self-confidence and closer relations to their parents than children who had lived with only one. 
I maintain that the advantages with joined custody outbalance the disadvantages. Although it can be problematic to commute between two homes, it is nothing compared to the problems of an absent father. If you live with both your parents you are never a guest in their homes, and you never have to choose between them. A divorce is never an easy matter but it is important that parents learn to cooparate for the sake of the children. This will eliminate the risk of them turning the children against the other parent. The children feel wanted and loved by both parents instead of rejected by the absent one.
Finally, I would like to stress that the most important thing for a child is a safe environment and a close relationship with both its parents. How this is created is of less importance but I do believe that all parents should try joined custody and the two-safe-homes model. Gustavsson and some other experts may claim that this is dangerous but they have not been able to proof anything. I maintain that they are wrong. Children need both of their parents!

107,1005.a2.txt,Batman vs. Superman Why Batman is cooler the Superman,"For a long time there has been a dispute about who of our biggest superheroes is the coolest. In this essay I will argue that Batman is the coolest. I will also give some definitions of both 'superhero' and 'cool'.
What qualities make a good superhero? Firstly, a well elaborated sense of justice and a will to help and protect the ordinary citizens are essential qualities of a hero. The main objective of the ""job"" is to make sure the public is protected against all sort of organized crime and also more unprovoked acts of violence. A feeling of guilt when not being able to help is also something that helps the hero and a clear cut determination, an attitude of I-won't-be-stopped is crucial for the motivation to carry out the mission.
The physical ability, the ability to win a man to man encounter with an evil villain, is of course very important if the hero wants to survive and do a good job. This is the first area were Batman and Superman are different. It will be discussed later in the essay.
Next on the list of obligatory superhero accessories is the outfit. It should be clearly distinguishable from contemporary fashion and it is good to make it as dramatic as possible. Of course the superhero's emblem is placed on the chest. It is also vitally important for the outfit to have cape with which the hero can make impressive and grand entries and exits from a crime scene. 
Last, but not least, there are the gadgets, which in many cases make or break the superhero. These should be very exclusive things designed uniquely for very specific uses, such as climbing walls extremely quick or freeze a lake in a moment. Here is another thing that clearly separates the two subjects of this text. While Superman has his gadgets so to speak built in, in that he has x-ray vision, is able to fly, can use his eyes to burn through virtually anything, Batman carries around real objects like small explosives, ropes with which to climb walls or to tie up crooks and small pistols.
Superheroes have an alter ego who leads their normal lives when they are not fighting crime. The respective alter egos of Superman and Batman are fundamentally different. This will be further discussed later. 
Outlined above are the general qualities that make a superhero. The purpose of this essay, however, is to argue why Batman is 'cooler' than Superman. Thus, we need yet another definition, namely that of the notion cool. 'Cool' is an ambiguous concept. Regretfully I have to use other more or less ambiguous terms to define it. To be cool is generally to act with brutal and uncompromising decisiveness while at the same time upholding integrity and discretion.
Having stated what makes a superhero and what it takes for this man (since both of the discussed characters are male) to do the job of a number-one-crime-fighter in a 'cool' and stylish way the comparison of Batman and Superman can start. They both qualify as superheroes according to the criteria above. They both serve the public and fight organized crime in their respective cities and they both have alter egos to preserve their images as ordinary men. That is about as far as the similarities go.
The main reason Batman is cooler than Superman is that, underneath the superhero personality, he is an ordinary man who can get hurt. He can die. Superman, who is by nature strong and almost indestructible, can't be said to take the same risk as Batman when confronting his opponents. This makes Batman's doings so much more admirable. Add to this the reasons why they came into this business. For Superman it was, more or less, because he could beat anyone and therefore used his strengths for the common good. Batman, on the other hand is doing it both as a kind of revenge for his parents death, murdered in street by robbers and to protect others from being victims of the same kind of meaningless crime. Hence, they both have clear ideological reasons for fighting evil villains but Batman has a more personal motivation which makes him more likely to do a good job.
When it comes to confronting the criminals Batman has the advantage of operating mostly at night making it more mysterious, he has to be, in lacking natural superpowers, extremely skilled and athletic. To Superman it is really no big effort put in his actions. This is why Batman has more things to help him, such as guns shooting ropes and big clouds of smoke hiding his disappearing. 
The things that most clearly separates the two are Batman's outfit, a black latex suit, a mask and a bat-shaped cape, Superman having a red and blue suit that doesn't really intimidate anyone, Batman's 'Batmobile' is also black and, by necessity indestructible, his big mansion with its cave where Batman monitors the criminal activities of Gotham City and their alter egos. Batman's Bruce Wayne being an affluent playboy in his grand gothic mansion, Superman's Clark Kent, a not very tough reporter.
If you take into account all these factors you see that Batman is the coolest of the two. The two main reasons for this is, then, that Batman is merely a mortal earthling while Superman is an alien being as close to immortality as one gets and Batman's alter ego who leads a far more stylish life being a secretive playboy than Superman's reporter who is all but a playboy.",0
108,1006.a2.txt,"However, if someone brutally kills two people he never met before, is he still entitled to live? The bible says ""eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth"". If someone kills my friend, I am entitled to kill the killer. The victim's friends and relatives might find this justified; that the killer has wasted his rights to live and should die himself. The hate they feel towards the person who killed someone they loved must be tremendous. Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth- life for life, for life, for life... This could go on forever, in an endless, evil circle: the victim's friend kills the killer, the killer's friend kills the killer, and soon we would all end up as killers. Eye for an eye, tooth for tooth. The American judicial system thinks that killing should be resolved by killing, and that it is the most efficient way of preventing other people to do the same thing. The fact that there are now 3,000 death-row-convicts in the United States, and that the murders have not decreased, does not seem to effect their opinion.","When we look back in time and think of our ancestors who lived a couple of hundred years ago, we see them as barbaric and unchristian. We think that we are so different from the brute Viking and the Medieval man; that the world of today is more sophisticated, and that we have developed since then. I do not know whom we are trying to fool. As I see it, the human race has not progressed at all, only changed our tools and methods. Today we have more ""sophisticated killing"", that seems to be justified as long as it is performed without any bloodshed and by the judicial authorities of certain countries in the world. The eight amendment of the United States of America says: ""Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted."" Yet, they take a righteous stand condemning the unwanted of society, the murderers and rapists, to be thrown into the garbage disposal of the country: the electrical chair, the gas chamber, the poison shot, or even hanging. If that is not ""cruel and unusual punishment"", then what is?
In 1977, a state Supreme Court in the U.S. judged that the capital punishment for rape was unconstitutional because it was disproportionate to the crime; eye for an eye tooth for a tooth. Maybe the federal government of U.S.A. should make this into the next amendment of the Constitution. Investigations show that the majority of victims' relatives want to see the person responsible dead, but when this happens they do not get much comfort out of it. Killing can never be resolved by killing!
The fact that the world's leading superpower and ""the big brother"" of the globe, the United States of America, kills its own citizens, is both incomprehensive and scary. 
In between 1930-67 the U.S. executed 3, 859 people under civil jurisdiction. Three fifths of all the executions took place in Georgia and Texas. At the end of 1997, 38 states and the federal government were still in favor of and practiced the death penalty. In 1998 U.S.A. killed 68 Americans, again the majority of the executions were performed in the southern states. Amnesty International has criticized the U.S. for their monstrous methods.
A couple of years ago, two teen-age boys killed another boy in Texas. The boys blamed each other, but after the trial one of the boys, the son of a high judge, was set free, and the other boy, a 19-year-old Latin American, was sentenced to death. The boy still claimed to be innocent, but that did not help. He is now one of the 3,000 Americans in death row, standing in line to get executed. What if this boy is innocent? What if his companion, the son of the judge, is the guilty one? The case smells like corruption. In the book ""Finding life on Death Row: Profiles on six Inmates"" by Katya Lezin, she writes that the criminals that are sentenced to death are ""not the worst criminals, but the vulnerable and the ones that are the least able to defend themselves."" The people they execute are normally retarded, mentally ill or juveniles, or else they are poor without enough money to pay for a good lawyer that can emancipate them. The capital punishment is cruel, unusual, inefficient, and unjust. In short, it is barbaric.
Another contradiction to common sense is the tremendous amount of money it costs to perform an execution. It costs the U.S. $900 million/year to execute their unwanted citizens. Why not use this money to prevent criminal behavior instead? The state of Ohio spent $1,5 million to execute a man who wanted to be killed. That amount of money could have prevented some murders, if it was used differently. 
I think that most people that are in favor of the capital punishment are not aware of all the facts, and have probably not thought it through. I can understand that, but what scares and disgusts me is the fact that there are well-educated people that are in favor of it and perform it. The stupidity and cruelty of the system amazes me, and I do not understand how anyone with a common sense and an informed mind can be in favor of the death penalty.",0
109,1007.a2.txt,Abolish the Monopoly,"I have chosen to discuss the Government's policy regarding alcohol. At present the Government holds monopoly on selling alcohol. They claim that there can not be a free market on alcohol because that would increase alcoholism. This is cited as the main reason for the policy. The income supposedly covers expenditure on alcohol related illnesses and crimes. However the income is far greater than the expenditure, this means that ""Systembolaget"" has become a very profitable buisness indeed. This issue is special as every person living in Sweden has an opinion regarding the subject. The majority want to be able to purchase alcohol at local stores such as the supermarket. 
 Furthermore this is not only a finacial issue. In my opinion the Government is supressing the individual freedom and functions as an overprotective guardian. Recently Sweden became a member of the EU. EU law states that monopoly is forbidden in EU- countries. So hopefully the monopoly will be abolished. As a result of the monopoly the Government are free to set whatever prices they wish. It is not unusual that productprices are increased with 300 per cent. 
 My opinion is that the Government must abolish the law that gives them the exclusive right to sell alcohol. When Sweden became a member of the EU we agreed to abide EU laws. The Swedish Government can no longer justify this monopoly if it wishes to be a responsible member of the union. I belive in the freedom of choise and the Government should not take advantage of the power the people have given them. This ""big brother"" mentality shows that the Government has very little faith in the Swedish populations ability to make healthy decisions in consumption of alcohol. If the Government will still maintain the monopoly they are basically saying that Swedish citizens can not hold such responsability. 
 It is my conclusion that this has nothing to do with alcohol consumption levels. It has to do with the Government foresaking freedom of choise for finacial gain. Why else would they maintain the monopoly, when voters want free market. The Government's declaration of incapacity towards the Swedish population must be abolished. This is want I want to point out. That alcohol is just an example of the Government's betrayl to the voters.",0
110,1008.a2.txt,We have to preserve the right to free abortion,"In 1992 there was a case of abortion in Ireland that attracted a lot of attention. A fourteen-year-old girl, who was raped by the father of one of her friends, got pregnant. Since abortion is not allowed in strictly Catholic Ireland she had to fight for a long time, and even threaten to commit suicide, before the Supreme Court established the right for her to go to England and have the abortion there. I wonder how this girl was supposed to give birth to a child under those circumstances. For the rest of her life the child would remind her of the terrible abuse she had been the victim of. In this specific case the situation was even more traumatic because the girl was so young she would not have had a chance to bring up and care for the baby the way a mother is expected to. I feel strongly about these issues and in this essay I will try to explain why the right to free abortion is one of the most important rights for a woman. 
Women have always chosen if they want to give birth to a child or not. The question is what social, economic and medical risks that should have to be involved. The answer is of course minimal risks. Despite this obvious answer 200 000 women are killed every year due to the fact that illegal, and in most cases risky, abortions still are common all over the world. This inconceivable number corresponds to one jet plane of women crashing... every day! For these women's sake, especially those in the developing countries, we have to prevent risky abortions by information and supply of contraceptives. In addition we have to fight for a legalisation of abortion in more countries.
As mentioned above the use of contraceptives is a way of preventing abortions. Some people may think that abortion is used as or instead of protection, but I seriously doubt that. The reason for my doubt is that a decision about abortion is never easy to make. It contains many feelings such as pain and guilt. Therefore it is hardly likely that anyone would want to go through this unless it is absolutely necessary. And besides, you can use protection and still get pregnant, because it is never 100 per cent safe unless you get sterilised. 
In addition to the medical outlook there are many arguments about ethics and morals that are often used by ""pro-life"" supporters. They claim that abortion is murder. I wonder how we are supposed to know when a collection of cells becomes a human being with human rights. The majority of all abortions take place in the first twelve weeks of pregnancy. Obviously we can not know if the embryo feels anything at that age but to me it is not very likely. 
My most important argument for free abortion is the woman's right to decide over her own body and consequently her own life. As I have mentioned abortion is often a question of morals, but is it really morally correct to carry a baby for nine months and then give birth to it when you know in advance that you will not be able to give the child what it needs and deserves? In these cases it is of course possible to have the baby adopted. But unfortunately there are already a lot more unwanted children and orphans than couples who want to adopt. My point is: should we bring children into the world even when we know that they are doomed to a life in misery from the beginning. 
Finally I would like to make clear that I defend abortion neither if the reason is that the baby will be disabled nor if it is used instead of contraceptives. Nevertheless, it is important that we keep the right to free abortion, which have been legislated in Sweden since 1975, and that we never restrict it. 
  In conclusion: the issue of abortion is a typical woman's right issue. It is also one of the most important. A woman should never have to risk her life while having an abortion. Therefore it is important to legalise it and to fight against those who oppose women's right to decide over their own bodies. I do not condemn the ""pro-life"" supporters but I can not understand their arguments, whether they are based on religion or morals.",0
111,1009.a2.txt,"Money, a symbol of happiness?","There is one main focus in the society of today and that is money. Getting more money, losing money, the use of money, the lack of money. So in this essay I will point to the different aspects of money, the use of it and what it can lead to. I will also point to certain things to start to change our views of money.

It is easier to measure happiness and success when you have something that symbolises all of these things. Our symbol is money. We are constantly reminded of the importance of money when people in developing countries are starving and lack access to water, the number of homeless people in industrial countries is slowly increasing, hospitals not being able to give proper care to patients, schools suffering from lack of funds that interfere with teaching. All of this when executives of multi national companies collect sevenfigure paycheques. You can clearly see the shift in balance. What can you do with a salary of $5 million that you can't do with a $2 million salary? You may point out that there is much responsibility and stress in to top of large companies, therefor the large sum of money given to its bosses. But is it fair to give that much money to people that have made that choice of stress and responsibility, when other people don't even get the chance of choosing, and get little, if any, money? I don't think there is anybody that thinks different, from a human value point of view.
But that point of view is not always used when looking upon money. All you can think about is what you can do if you had the money, or reversed, what you can't do because there isn't enough money. It permeates the entire society, or should I say Western culture society, although it has spread like a disease to other continents outside North and South America and Europe. Even into places not at all connected with money, like the Shoaling temple in China. Even those old institutions, one never thought would be adapted to capitalism, are being swept along in the tide that is capitalism. 
While these ancient pillars of wisdom are evolving into a money-based system, the society is being divided into three groups; a social elite at the top of the pyramid, more and more separated from the common people; In the middle of the pyramid you find the middle class; And the working class is situated in the lower areas of this power-pyramid. The distribution of money is reversed, with huge sums given to the top of the pyramid, the middle class taking what they can get their hands on, and the remains thrown to the masses like crumbles from the king's table. If this regression is to continue, we may in the near future equal money with life and prosperity and increasing crime and bad health with poor people, people fighting to get their hands on enough to stay alive, robbing from each other, killing each other. As the situation is now, all criminal activities can be linked to money, in a direct or indirect way.
Crime is directly connected to money in that way that you either want money or something that is very valuable, something you can't buy. In that quest for money, people get hurt. Victims suffer both physically and mentally damages, while the criminals can be sentenced to capital punishment in many countries. All of this for pieces of paper that we decide are important.
I think, that instead of dedicating our short lives to the search for money with all its hidden dangers we should pursue personal happiness oppose to the longing for more and more money that is generated. But as long as the symbol of money stands for success and happiness, we are stuck in old habits. We should try to distance ourselves from the money, realise that it's just a piece of paper, a symbol. That it's not in any way connected with happiness. Then, and only then, we can start to develop the idea of equality for all. 

Conclusion
We have to change the current system unless we want larger differences between rich and poor. If we want total equality for all we have to start by changing the view of money that most people have. That of ownership. You don't own your money, you're just borrowing it for a while.",0
112,1010.a2.txt,WHO SHOULD LOOK AFTER THE ELDERLY -THE FAMILY OR THE STATE?,"Before the industrial evolution the family always took care of its members, both the young and the old. But even longer ago the old family members threw themselves out from a high rocket in order not to be a burden to the rest of the family. That sounds really cruel to us in modern life. A main reason for having many children (apart from the fact that people were not aware of birth control) was that it was a kind of life insurance. At least someone should still be there to look after you when you got old. 

The industrial evolution parted family life from work. All our social institutions started to grow up: hospitals, institutions f√∂r the care of the aged, kindergartens which much later became day care center etc.

The social institutions grew very big and strong in Sweden during the long rule of the Social Democratic Party after World War II. The ideal Swedish home (folkhemmet) was highly valued. Everyone should trust the state to take care of you from birth to death (from the cradle to the grave). That is, or rather was, so to say, the Swedish culture. 

During the 60s the women started to work more outside the home which meant that they got less time to take care of the family's elderly members.

By the end of the 80s when the recession came the government got out of money to finance all the big and expensive social institutions. The govermental sector had to decrease in order to save money for the nation. The price of the wellfare had become too high. It had been taken for granted for too long. Discussions started about other alternatives. You can find tree main alternatives:
1. Public social institutions (hospitals and institutions for elderly care)
2. Private institutions
3. Family care of elderly

I believe in a combination of 1 and 2. From my female point of view the third alternative is not realistic in today's society. Almost every woman with children is working in Sweden. We have the highest rate of working mothers in the world. But I think many other countries in Western Europe and in USA are approaching the same level.

Most women still have the main responsibility for taking care of their families. You can really say that women have two full time jobs - the work and the family. Besides this you should have a clean and beautiful house and garden, go to the gym, be well-dressed,
 read books, be social, bake cakes etc etc. Should you besides all this also take care of your old and ill parents? The answer can only be one - NO. It would be an extra burden for most women.
Women of today live under a lot of stress and press. The stress diseases among women are rising, like burn-outs, even heartattacks. Taking care of elderly should in the long run lead to even more stress-diseases among women. And who will then look after the women?

If we had a situation of more equality between man and woman - and I do believe we should have - we might be able to take care of our elderly in our homes. But I doubt that there are any man who wants to have an old and ill parent living with them.

Elderly people usually need a lot of medical care which you must be educated for. Taking care of both young and old people at the same time is just too much. You need a lot of patience. When the kids start school and grow older of course you get more time. But most women fill the hours with work and enjoy finally having some time of her own.

It is not just a question of time of course. I think it is a nice thought to take care of your parents like they took care of you as a child. But it is a very idealistic and unfortunately an unrealistic thought.

In my own experience the social institutions in Sweden like hospitals and institutions for elderly care, work very well. My own parents and other older relatives have always been treated in a very proffesional and human way at hospitals when needed in times of illness and death. The support to us in the family has also been very good. When you read the newspapers it does not seem to work like this but I believe it does in most cases.

But the question remains if we can afford all these expensive hospitals and institutions. They can probably work in a more rational way than they do and a lof of effort is aiming at that. Another way is to raise the fees. If you have to stay at a hospital for some time it hardly costs you anything.

The argument against private alternatives is that it is only for the rich. But I believe that taking insurances a long time ahead is a way of financing a private alternative. I also believe they to some extent can be financed by the goverment because they ease the pressure on the public hospitals.

If you want to take care of your elderly at home you need medical assistance in your home which must be provided by a hospital. 

My conclusion is that the freedom of choice is the best idea, although I personally favour public hospitals and institutions combined with private alternatives.",0
115,1014.a2.txt,Why the element of surprise is dear to man.,"The human brain has a never-ceasing need to classify and organize new things it encounter in our environment. We like the safety of knowing what we are dealing with when we move around on our daily routines. But at the same time, as much as we are dependent on things to work in a familiar way, we need to be surprised. Surprise is born in the contrast between how we expect things to be or behave and how they eventually turn out. This contrast can be taken to a certain extent; we all have different thresholds for what we can take in certain situations. There is for example not much room for us coping with something unexpected when we already are under a considerable amount of stress. However, in sensible doses, there will always be a need for excitement created by something not presently thought of to happen, to change our otherwise dull and slentrian ways of living our lives (as a result of our perverse need to feel in control, of which the brain has mastery). The following text consists of examples supporting this theory.

Why we find certain jokes humorus has been debated for ages and there are no easy answers. I think I can acertain though, that many jokes has the unveiling of something unexpected in the punch line or an ending with a twist of some kind, as essential to their success. Hopefully this agrees with the receiver's sense of humor, in which case the thrill is attained and perhaps the breaking of unnecessary tension also is achieved.

In a relationship you do little things to show affection to your partner, things you might have arranged for unasked or do in a way contrary to the usual and thereby create an element of surprise, probably in a romantic sense. These are intended to cause excitement, positively influencing the relationship.

Movies and literature gives us thrills. We watch and read for the sake of suspense, uncertainty and perhaps shocking special effects. Scenarios where we feel we have many things in common with the main characters and where the unraveling of events is unexpected but possible, tend to strike a certain chord in us and we get more tied up in what is going to happen to these persons. Thus the unexpected event the character is experiencing can have more real-life-like effects on the watcher's/reader's mind.

Different ages have different needs of surprising events, all according to experience. The game of Peek-a-boo may for instance give small children a cheap thrill, while an older person need a somewhat more unprobable case of events presented to him/her to be entertained. In either way it is the surprise that gets to them.

Some levels of stress can be positive, to keep you alert, when holding a lecture, etc. Here it is more the fear of surprise (let us say the fear of having half the audience standing up and leaving in the middle of your presentation or have them laughing at / booing your essential ideas) which makes us stressed rather than the surprise itself. 

The effects surprise has on us in the instances above is something we welcome and appreciate. We need this in order to feel that we have been through something meaningful by the end of the day.

The element of surprise is useful in many situations to make other people feel better or to brake the tension of a situation. Sometimes the awareness of that a surprising event is probable to take place, but not what shape it will present itself in, is enough to be thrilled. The brain is ambivalent in its handling of the element of surprise; it wants to have control of a situation, which it gets by learning about and organizing things present in that situation, but it also has a need to be surprised and perhaps overwhelmed by unexpected series of events. The element of surprise is indeed a dear thing to man, of wich he/she tries to encounter on a daily basis, to make the ordinary life we all experience less dull.",0
116,1016.a2.txt,Test the mental health of the police force,"The last couple of years the reports about police officers being too violent while making an arrest or supervise an event have increased dramatically. Before I moved to Stockholm I did not know much about this and had never met anyone who had been exposed to this. But now almost half of my male friends have some experience from police brutality. And to tell the truth, I'm scared of the police.
I don't know if this is a phenomena only found in big cities. But on the other hand that should not matter. Because of all this I think the policemen should have to be mentally tested, not only when they apply to the education, but also at least every fifth year during their professional career. 
Last weekend there was a demonstration in Stockholm against police brutality, because of an incident the weekend before that, when a lot of youths were beaten and arrested by the police for blocking and painting the street. It might be that it was necessary for the police to interfere but the police is supposed to use the least violent method, which they could not possibly have done. 
Another example of police officers being to aggressive is one of my boyfriend's experiences. It happened at a soccer match. The policemen pulled two of his friends in to their bus and beat them with truncheons, although Swedish police is not even allowed to use these any more. And may I point out here that all these boys had done was to refuse to leave the cue to the mobile shop where they were standing. When they refused the police provoked them, by calling them names, to yell at the them. Hardly something you deserve getting beaten for! About a year ago a young girl was molested and by policemen treated in an inhuman way at a police station after she was arrested. I do not think this is the way it's supposed to be! But on the other hand we can't take away the police officers. They are after all here to make the citizens feel secure and to protect them and stop criminal activity. And we need them.
Before accepted to the police academy the applicants are mentally tested to make sure they are suitable for the job. You would think that this would mean that the police officers are mentally stabile, but obviously something is happening over the years that makes them more aggressive. I think it is very hard to find out what that something is, and until someone does and the problem with violent police officers can be solved, I think all police officers mentality shall be tested at least every fifth year. Society have a lot to win by doing so. First of all people like myself, who hear a lot of scary examples about police brutality can stop being afraid of them and get some respect back instead. And if the police stop provoking youths to be violent there would not be so many fights all the time between young people and the police. Now, it's almost as if the police are creating their own jobs by causing disorder. As it is now, many youths have no confidence in the police force and every now and than you hear young people say that they hate the police, and I don't think that's something they just say to act cool in front of friends.
The police need to regain some respect and the best way to do so is to stop provoking people, stop using more violence than necessary, and for this to be possible the quality of the police men has to be higher. Those who abuse their position has to be told not to do so or be removed from work. We can not have a society were people are afraid of it's lawmen. Therefor we need to test the mentality of our police, so that we have a chance to find those who are not suitable for the police work.",0
117,1017.a2.txt,No to separation for Basque Nationalists.,"I am sure that all of us several times have read newspaper articles about the liberation movement in the Basque Country, Spain. We have been presented photographs of men dressed in black clothes with robber's hoods and weapons, demanding freedom for their homeland. It could be anywhere in the world, but it is actually not that far from us. Even in Europe, in the European Union, we have this problem. Can terrorism ever be accepted and if so, on what basis? Should the Spanish government accept and cooperate with these men who actually are criminal? This matter affects many people daily, but it's not very much debated. What lies behind the Basque nationalism and why is it so violent? It is impossible to visit northern Spain without noticing the problems, and after a year in Bilbao I have seen enough of the ""Liberation Movement"" to make a stand against it.
However, when discussing minority groups in general it is important to be aware of their historical background and other issues like religion or minority language that have separated them from other groups. For the Basque people the key factor for separation has been their mother tongue Euskera. Euskera is considered to be the oldest still spoken language in the world and has no connection to any other language.1 Like all languages, Euskera expresses so much more than just words for communication. Included in the language is also culture, tradition, history etc. This gives the speakers a national identity that unites them. Therefore, what could possibly be more efficient if you want to split up a minority group than forbidding their language and education of their children? This is what General Franco did when he after the Spanish Civil War 1936 led the Spanish nation in to an era of terror and dictatorship. He closed down all Basque schools, forbid the people to speak their mother tongue and if you had a Basque name you had to change it to a Spanish. It might be true, like many believe, that discrimination like these, make minorities even more united and value their culture even more than before, but unfortunately that's not the whole truth in this particular case. When Franco's dictatorship fell into pieces after years of oppression, Basque schools could open up again, traditional music was played and the national feelings were overwhelming. But too long time had passed of oppression and censure. A whole generation of children had grown up without speaking Euskera and they could therefore not identify themselves with the Basque tradition as previous generations had done for hundreds of years. The Basque tradition was threatened.
When listening to this bloody history, many might think that total independence from Spain would be the right way for the Basque people to go. However, I am strongly against a total separation of the two parts and it also seems to be the opinion of the Basque people. In the 1998's referendum, the majority voted for a continued unity with Spain under the condition that they, to some extent, would be able to retain their own legislation. A continued unity between Spain and the Basque Country must not mean a continued dominance of the Spanish culture. The Basque Country is today considered to be bilingual (even though the majority speak Spanish) and it has both Spanish and Basque media. The children have to study Euskera and Basque culture, which strengthens their Basque identities. They get familiar with their history, which is essential for a nation that wants to move on forward. Would the situation differ if they were to be an independent state? What are the goals for the liberation parties?
Due to this, I think it would be interesting to examine the part of the population that still struggles for independence and especially the way they do it. The famous ""Basque Independence Movement"" is made up by a small but radical sector of the political arena. The underground organisation ETA ( Basque Homeland and Liberty) has killed more than 700 people, mostly civilians, in 25 years of terrorist activity. University professors and other intellectuals who have been critical of ETA have been harassed and sometimes killed. A big part of the wealthy have had to leave their homes. The fear of kidnapping and ETA's ""revolutionary tax"" have forced them to Madrid and Barcelona. Spray painting and bombings of national buildings are still everyday incidents. An essay like this would be hard to hand in at a university in the Basque Country since people still are afraid of discussing the situation publicly. How can terrorists with so much blood on their hands demand total independence from Spain due to harassment and discrimination during the dictatorship more than 30 yeas ago? What have they learned from their own history?
Furthermore, the Basque Country today is a well developed part of Spain with high education level and low unemployment figures. It has got space for both the traditional Basque culture, the integrated Spanish and new international influences. How would a separation from Spain affect the Basque industry, trade and, in the end, it's well being. Is it really worth risking the relationship that actually supports the Basque culture and existence? In the end it's not a political term that decides whether the Basque Country is independent. It's the well being, the high living standard and preservation of the Basque culture and language that determine the level of independence.
Finally, the concerns of total independence for the Basque people is not unique in the world. Many other states and regions want independence. What unfortunately seems to go hand-in- hand with this demand, where ever in the world it might be, is violence and turmoil. The political violence in the Basque country is destroying more than it will ever gain in terms of independence. It is the never ending hate and destructiveness that makes me feel strongly against the liberation movement. But let's stay optimistic. As mentioned previously, the majority of the Basque people want peace and therefore there is a good chance of eventually getting the Basque Country free from terror and violence.

118,1018.a2.txt,Capital punishment- unacceptable in a modern democracy,"The right to our life is the most principle of all the human rights. If society removes that right from the people, it violates all the other rights as well. Still, a number of felonies and violent crimes are committed every day and finding a way to decrease the number is an important task. Imprisonment as a solution offers the possibility of a normal life after the criminal has served his sentence. Capital punishment however, is a final punishment. 
It can be difficult to get a fair trial since several aspects of society are involved in the process. In the United States, which is supposed to be one of the world's leading countries, capital punishment is being used in a discriminating way against certain groups in society, for example, poor people who cannot afford a proper defence, and minority groups. Minority groups, especially African Americans run a greater risk of being sentenced to the capital punishment than whites. Also, criminals who have committed murder where the victim is white, rather than black, is more often sentenced to death. 
One common argument of those who favour the death penalty is that it has a deterrent effect on other criminals. Although several investigations have been made regarding the connection between capital punishment and crime, there is no evidence that the death penalty is more deterrent than other forms of punishment. For instance, many crimes are commited when the criminal is affected by alcohol or drugs and does not consider the consequences of his actions, which means that the punishment he could be getting in a trial, has no deterrent effect at the time the crime is commited. Likewise, criminals who commit murder assume that they will not get arrested, and the deterrent effect would probably be greater if the risk of getting arrested increased. Some people want to use capital punishment with the purpose of preventing the criminal from repeating his crime, but you can never know whether the criminal would have repeated his crime, or not. Furthermore, capital punishment removes the chance of rehabilitation, and that is the aim for most prisons. 
Capital punishment creates a brutal society. Criminals who risk getting the death penalty in a trial will do everything in their power to avoid getting arrested, which means that they will arm themselves and maybe even kill in ""self-defence"". There is also a risk that important persons like witnesses, jurors and lawyers will be bribed or threatened during the trials. When the court decides to execute a human being, it states an example which reduces the public's respect for human life. An execution is a violent act, and violence brings violence. When society use the death penalty as a punishment, who shall be punished when an innocent person has been executed? 
Capital punishment is an irrevocable act, and the risk of punishing innocent people should be enough to stop the use of this penalty. If new evidence proves that the executed person is not guilty, it is already too late. Some countries have unfair and rapid trials with the execution following directly afterwards, which makes appeals and petitions for mercy impossible. The number of convicted innocent persons in such countries is frightfully high. In the United States it has been revealed that at least 23 innocent human beings have been executed during the 20th century. The true number is naturally unknown. 
Seen from a human aspect, capital punishment is a brutal and cruel punishment which does not belong in a civilized society. Living in death row in the United States has been described as being like a living dead, waiting only for the date to be executed, and to wait for 15 years is not unusual. The methods that are used varies throughout the world, some are more barbarian than others. The question is, which is the smoothest way to kill a human being?
In brief, capital punishment ought not to be accepted in a democracy, since only a few persons can decide whether another human being is allowed to live or not. People can change and they can be rehabilitated, and if someone is mentally ill he can be treated. That is why capital punishment should be prohibited. Instead, the risk of getting arrested and sentenced to prison should be increased, as a deterrent effect for criminals. When you use capital punishment, you cross the line and become like the criminal you are punishing, with the difference that you have the law on your side and another name for the act. Likewise it is a fact that innocent people have been convicted, and since capital punishment is irrevocable, the risk is unacceptably high and the consequences unforgivable. Naturally the criminals should be punished for their crimes, but there are more effective penalties, which avoid a brutalization of society and maintain the respect of human life.",0
119,1019.a2.txt,HIP-HOPPIN'TO THE BE-BOPPIN': DEFENDING THE HONOUR OF RAP MUSIC,"Ever since rap, or hip-hop music began to reach beyond the urban black ghettos of North Americas major cities, it has been accused of glorifying violence and sexism as well as proclaiming reverse racism. But perhaps most importantly: rap has to date not been recognized as a distinct and valuable form of music. 
This essay will argue that rap music is a valid continuation of the African American cultural idiom, and that it as an art form, and as a social and cultural testimony, must be valued as highly as earlier forms of black music like blues, gospel and jazz. 
I will show that the driving force behind the development of the different genres of black music, can be traced to a basic dialectic process in which each new form of black music has been a reaction against the commercialisation of the previous generations musical expression. 
This process of reclaiming ones cultural heritage and recreating it is as evident in the birth of the modern jazz movement of the 1940s, as it is in the creation of hip-hop and rap in the late 1970s and early 80s.

Rap, the music of the African American youth, is primarly the music of resistance. Like all earlier forms of black music it constitutes a radical attempt by black people to express themselves, as well as trying to create a sphere of communication that's beyond the grasp of the white commercial recording industry. 
Rap music is perhaps the best example of how a new generation of black people are taking the music ""back to the street"", in order to escape exploitation at the hands of greedy business men. The abandonment of the glamorous disco movement, with its extravagant stage shows and outrageous costumes, in favour of the simple formula of a turntable and a microphone, clearly manifests the essence of black music. 

Music has never just been about money for black people. It has been their only available mode of expression, in a racist society that seeks to control their every move (especially when this movement was collective). The slaves were left with nothing but their voices and bodies, and that was enough. With these instruments they created worksongs, which later merged with hymns and became gospel. 
All throughout history this has been the main characteristic of African American music; the ability to incorporate all kinds of instruments and forms of music in order to multiply the forms of expression. The clearest examples of this phenomenon is found in jazz and rap music. Jazz incorporated European instruments and concepts from classical music and transformed them into a distinct form of black music. The pioneers of hip hop changed the gramophone, a devise constructed solely for the purpose of playing recorded music, into an instrument capable of making its own melodies and improvisations. 
What the African American musical evolution has been about, is in essence, the attempt to ""africanize"" all these elements of European music. Africans never bothered with meter, scales, pitch etc. in the same way as the European composers. I'm not implying that these concepts don't exist in African music, they do. But the people never payed them much mind. Music was about communication, a forum for social commentary and a form of oral history. This was the main difference between the African American and European conceptions of music. The conflicting ideas about the function of music being either communicative and participatory, or composed pieces which should be performed before an audience, not together with them.

Thus, the core of African American music isn't about theories or concepts. That's the way white people talk about music. Black music is about soul, it is about a certain attitude, it is about that special beat, that moan, those small nuances that lets you know that it's a black person singing or playing. White musicians have always tried to sound black, and white businessmen has tried to squeeze that sound out of their manufactured light skinned copies, but extremely few, if any, have succeded. 
But they certainly have tried, and their attempts to steal the music from its creators and stripping it of all its ""blackness"" has outraged African American musicians, and driven them to find new, distinctively black forms of expression. This has created a dialectic process, in which each attempt to capitalize on a form of black music, has been met by a new generation of musicians adapting the earlier tradition to a new social and cultural climate. Just as the modern jazz of the 40s was a slap in the face of the racism of white middle-class America; just as the soul and funk of the 60s and 70s raised their fists in the name of Black Power, so is the rap music of today a cry for justice from the back alleys of the Promised Land. 

The critics of rap music is basically expressing the same racism and fear (fear of having to finally take responsability for centuries of oppression of its minorities) that critics of the different modern jazz forms did decades ago. Those who claim that rap doesn't qualifiy as an art form, or even as music, has not understood the African American conception of what music is. The quality of music is not measured in relation to its complexity, orchestration or theorethical blueprint. Good music is emotional, it's provocative, it raises questions about right and wrong. Good black music speaks to you, and it demands a response, it demands your participation. Good African American music is an expression of what it means to be black in a racist society. It is, by definition, a social commentary, whether it's instrumental jazz or vocal rap music. 
Black music doesn't need words to express the anger and frustration of it's people. Every aspect of their emotional spectra is right there, in the composition of he music, in the beat of the drum, in the howling cries, or the sweet, warm tones of the saxophone. Black music doesn't require notes or a schooled musician, it doesn't even need a melody (in the Western sense of the word), all it really needs is rhythm and a message. 

The violence and sexism in the lyrics of rappers is not fictional, neither is it a form of entertainment. The lyrics are a reflection of an existing reality. A reality where black people are constantly being oppressed and isolated, and turning on each other in desperation. These lyrics are no more violent, and no more unjustified than the furious cries of John Coltrane's saxophone in the turbulent days of the 1960s.
Rappers today are doing what black musicians always has done. They are trying to regain the control over their own cultural heritage from the hands of a predominately white recording industry. They are demanding that they be given the freedom of expression that they've never been granted. The freedom to express every aspect of what it means to be a black person in the United States (including those aspects that certain parts of society don't want to deal with). Therefore rap is, as all forms of African American music, a protest and a social commentary. But, as all other forms of black music, it's also an art form and it shouldn't be judged on the basis of Western concepts of music. Instead it should be viewed as the latest stage in the evolution of African American music, and as a revaluation and readaptation of all the earlier stages of this process to a new social and cultural situation.",0
120,1020.a2.txt,A teacher's status and salary: nothing to brag about,"Introduction1
In the society of today it seems that children's upbringing more and more should fall under the responsibility of their schoolteacher, because now teachers are supposed to teach the students the knowledge they need, and then also be their parents.
You might have thought that the responsibility to teach children to behave and not become criminals was the parents' job. Wrong, it has now been shifted to become the teacher's job. The community, the parents and sometimes their own schoolboard seem to think the teachers should hold the children's hands every minute of the day. And even if they do so, it does not mean that they can be sure to get some compliments for doing it.
And this is what I want to point out that, as many people already have said, the profession of teaching has a much too low status and is not nearly paid as much as they ought to be paid. Because is it really fair when you have the job of teacher, psychiatrist and parent etc. every minute of the day to have such a poor salary? 

Physical & Mental Abuse
There are many teachers that suffer from various physical injuries that they have drawn upon themselves during working hours. I do not say that you cannot get injuries in other occupations as well. I only think that most people do not think about the profession as teacher being a high-risk job in which you might get hurt. Some of the most usual injuries are to the back, the neck and the vocal chords. Another thing that teachers often suffer from is the stress of never being totally free from work. They get burnt out, in other words. 
The mental aspect is that many students of today seem to have lost the respect for the teachers. The students manifest this disrespect e.g. by talking back at the teacher when he/she tells them to do something, or by cursing at the teacher. If this continue under a longer period it can be a great strain, and sometimes the teacher feels that he/she has to move to get away from it. 
It is also often that the teacher gets students whose parents think they know better than the teacher does when it comes to teaching and they often express this loudly.
For example, I know a teacher who had a weak student. She tried to help him as much as she could. She offered him her help after school. Because she would stay and work after school anyway, he could stay and do his homework there, if he wanted to. Then if he did not understand something he could ask her. The student ignored her offer. When the term was through and his parents still thought the boy did not do as well as they would want to, they did not want to understand that his bad work discipline was the problem. No, they instead phoned the teacher up on the ceremony day and rowed at her for not giving the boy enough help. She had not done anything to help him, according to his parents.

Teacher equals Parent?
It is quite interesting to see that the society of today is expecting teachers to act as a curator, psychiatrist, teacher, and parent, all at the same time. But of course the society also expects the teachers to do all these jobs but just get paid for one of these jobs. And, if I might add poorly paid for one of these jobs. 
I cannot understand why some parents are so liberated from any IQ that they seem to think that when the children start in school, their time of raising the children is done. It is not the school's job to raise the children in becoming good little citizens. Although I might admit, that the school might have some part in it. But it is not up to the school to raise the children, look after them and have the responsibility for the children's actions during the time, which is not school time. Unfortunately some people have a hard time understanding this. There are even people who think that the school should have even more responsibility for the children than it already has. So in the future it seems, as the school will be a substitute for home with the teachers playing substitute parents. But I doubt that they will be more paid for the new role. 

Status & Salary
I don't know when the teacher profession got such a low status. But I sincerely hope that it has had a higher status than it has now. Because, if you should view the status of teachers from the aspect of how much they get in salary, the profession is not much worth.
For example, the average salary for a 1-7-teacher is approximately SEK 17,000 after they have worked a year. My mother who has worked as a 4-6 grade teacher for over 30 years gets only SEK 22, 000 in salary. 
In comparison with the salary of the Swedish MP's, they get approximately SEK 38,000 per month and they sometimes do not bother to come to the proceedings in the Parliament. If a teacher would do that, their already low salary would be even lower.
Someone might argue that the MP's have a bigger responsibility. Well, the person who does that can work as a teacher for a year and then we will see if he/she still thinks that. 

Conclusion
I certainly think that teachers deserve a higher salary to give the profession a higher status, among other things. A status it desperately needs to attract people to the profession. Many of the teachers who have only worked for a couple of years feel that they cannot recommend their own profession to anyone. The two main reasons that come up are the low salary and the status. They feel that the profession does not get the appreciation it deserves, which I totally agree with. Many people might think that teaching is an easy occupation. But there is nothing easy in getting nasty comments from people who are younger than you, while you try to give a lecture. During which time you get a low salary for a burden of work, which is only increasing every year due to savings in the sector.
Savings the Government thinks they can justify with a salary of more than SEK 38,000 in salary.

121,1021.a2.txt,Religious Studies - a matter of life itself,"Every time the curriculum for Swedish high school is up for revision, there is someone who tries to argue that Religious Studies is not necessary for everyone to take. This is a standpoint I can not agree with. Instead, I would like to point out to you why I consider it being of great importance to keep Religious Studies as a compulsory subject in Swedish high school.

To start with, I would like you to stop and think of the picture that meets you every time you enter the streets of any Swedish town today. Look at the people you meet! Their skin color differs from one another's, their hair, their names - every where you look there is diversity. Today's Swedes are no longer necessarily blond with blue eyes - in fact, some women do not even show their hair but hide it under a scarf. However, if it was only the outside of people that differed, that would maybe not be a big problem, byt that is not the case. Not only do people look different but they do also act in different ways from what we may be used to. They speak and act in a way we do not always understand and this causes some of us to be frigthened. 

It is a most human reaction to be afraid of the things we do not understand. A recent example of what fear of the unknown might lead to is given by the debate preceding the building of a mosque in Uppsala. Many people were afraid of what a minaret would do to the city silhouette and how much the calling to prayer would disturb the neighbourhood. In the end it was decided that the minareth in question was not allowed to be built higher than the top of the nearby gymnastics hall and there would be no calls from the minareth, since almost none of the members of the muslim society of our town live near enough to hear it anyway. This is an interesting debate, I think, considering the summarized amount of hours that Swedish Church bells are ringing in a year. No one tries to argue that this is so disturbing that it ought to be forbidden.

On the contrary, I would like to argue that if we knew more about the people who have come to live in Sweden for various reasons, about their cultural backgrounds and the places where they used to live, much of the fear would fade away. Since religion is such an important part of culture, this is why Religious Studies is important for Swedish high school students.

Considering the above, my opinion is that a knowledge of different religions and cultures gives a person an understanding of other people, their lives and thinking. Understanding helps you to overcome your fear of the formerly unknown. Under-standing your neighbor's way of living in contrast to your own also gives you an understanding of Swedish society as it is today.

The question of Swedish society can also be highlighted by the almanac. Religious Studies as a subject studied in high school can give both native and immigrant Swedish teenagers an answer to why we have a holidays like Christmas, Easter and All Saints Day. As a matter of fact, our country and its laws are formed on a Christian set of values and beliefs. Religious Studies should be able to contribute to an understanding of the history and tradition of the country we all live in. 

Finally, some people might want to argue that Religious Studies are of no importance for a seventeen-year-old boy who wants to work as a meachanic. Why does he have to study such a specialized and theoretic subject? My answer to that is simple: Because the mechanic working next to him might bear the name Muhammed and he may very well prefer spending his Friday lunch hour praying instead of eating a pizza with cheese, tomato and ham on top. If the young man is given tuition in different religious beliefs, he will more easily understand Muhammed's choice and not just put him off as odd.

The aim of my argument has been to show that Religious Studies is a subject that deals with life itself and of understanding our own context. That is why it is essential to keep this subject as a compulsory subject for Swedish teenagers to study in high school.",0
122,1022.a2.txt,Swedens carnivores¬≠ a big threat!,"Today, more than 10 000 reindeers are killed every year by Sweden's four big carnivores; the bear, the wolf, the lynx and the wolverine. Accordingly, the carnivores are the greatest threat against the reindeer breeding. Several reindeer breeders have found it impossible to go on with their business when their capital functions as prey. The opinion in Sweden has in the last decades turned and the vast majority of the population are in favour of an increased number of carnivores in our surroundings. Is it, thou, justified that one group shall suffer from all its consequences? It seems to me like the Swedish authorities doesn't know how to handle this question and in decision making they act irrationally. For many reindeer breeders this question is a matter of giving up there livelihood and part of their culture, and therefore the problem has to be taken seriously and it must be discussed.

Reindeer breeders are especially affected by carnivores as reindeers by custom aren't kept in fences. They are in the spring moved from the woodlands to mountainareas where they have their calves and graze during the summer months. In the autumn they are moved back to the woodlands. It is difficult to protect the animals from being attacked considering the fact that the reindeer breeders don't supervise their animals on a daily basis. It is therefore essential to reduce every risk of loosing capital. 

A raindeer breeder are not allowed to kill a carnivore threatening his herd without permission from higher authority. Since the general policy in Sweden is to keep as many carnivores as possible their requests are often rejected, and in frustration they illegally kill the threatening animal. Having in mind that one single lynx can kill 100 reindeers (weakened by a cold winter with lots of snow and bad nutrition) at one occasion you can imagine the frustration felt by the raindeer breeder when his request of shooting the lynx is turned down. I'm not saying that the lynx is a beast, she is simply acting according to her instincts, killing as many prey as possible to. As already mentioned many reindeer breeders, especially in the counties of H√§rjedalen and J√§mtland, have been forced to give up their business due to the fact that their reindeers functions as prey. I think a reindeer breeder should have the right to defend his herd against threatening carnivores to a greater extent than today.

In the past centuries Sweden's larger carnivores were consider as a big threat. The frequent hunt of them even lead to the extinction of the Swedish wolves. Wolves and lynx are originally not found in mountain areas. They are animals adopted to the forest, but when the animals interests collided with human they were outclassed by human establishment. The carnivores who survived was those established far away from urban areas. Since the opinion has turned in the last decades and the number of carnivores are allowed to increase, the number of carnivores in non urban areas have consequently increased considerable. However, reindeer breeders have always lived in and kept their reindeers in this areas in the winter and with the increasing number of carnivores and the prohibition of shooting them, they are in a precarious situation. 

The reindeer breeders are a small and anonymous group and not much of this inflamed discussion has reached the rest of Sweden. What have reached the news is that reindeer breeders illegally and beastly kills carnivores. In contrast, if a bear kills 40 sheep, like in recently, or if wolves attacks huntingdogs, like in V√§rmland respective Sm√•land recently, it is justified to shoot them. People can relate to a farmer loosing sheep and a hunter loosing a dog and therefore the carnivore is looked upon as a threat. The same goes for bears and wolves who wander off, ending up in the woods surrounding Stockholm. They first become a big tourist attractions and then after having consulted experts it is decided that they needs to be shooten.

Sweden's larger carnivores are a great threat to the reindeer breeding. According to me a reindeer breeder should have the right to protect his capital without first having to ask for permission. I don't realise why one small minority group has to face all the concequeses concerning Sweden wanting to increase its number of carnivores. It is relevant to ask weather reindeer breeding just are going to function as a food producer enabling Sweden to pride itself having rescued the wolves and the lynx.",0
123,1023.a2.txt,"Save pop music - boycott ""carbon-paper"" artists!","Popular music of today is badly infected with a virus called 'cover songs'. A cover song is best described as a song that is written and/or performed by one artist, and after a period of time 'recycled' and performed by another. If the first artist turned the song into a huge commercial hit, the second one probably will too. The popular music of today suffers badly from this virus, and if nothing is done about it, popular music as we know it may very well die, due to a lack of new ideas. We don't want that to happen, do we? So, the only way ordinary music consumers can help wiping out the virus is by boycotting CD's and other recordings that include cover songs.

Nobody in his right mind would ever bring a box of crayons to a museum to ""improve a few of the paintings"". People respect the paintings as well as the artists too much to even think of such a stupid idea. A song is in many respects a piece of art and therefore deserves to be treated with respect. Naturally, the same goes for the songwriter. But very often, that is not the case. Let me give you a recent example:
The way, for instance, A-Teens (former ABBA-teens, four teenagers doing ABBA songs) treat old ABBA classics reveals a total lack of respect, no matter what the manager of the group claims. In his opinion, A-Teens keep 'the spirit of ABBA' alive by copying old ABBA hits. But the truth is probably that 'the spirit of ABBA' was doing just fine without the help of A-Teens, probably even better than now.
Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson, the men behind the original hits, obviously were taken by surprise by the record company and therefore weren't able to stop the project at the very beginning, even though I am certain they would have wanted to. At least they were able to change the name of the teen group from ABBA-teens to A-teens, and that way avoid further degradation. But by buying an A-Teen album you participate in ruining the reputations of two outstanding artists who deserve better than that.

Then there is the question of money. Is it ethical to profit from another persons hard work? In my opinion, absolutely not. But that is what has happened in many cases throughout musical history. As an example I could mention the all-female rock group Star. They were totally unknown until only a few months ago when somebody in their organisation, probably a smart manager, realised that they would stay unknown - and broke - forever, unless something happened. Thus, they recorded a new version of the old Kiss song ""Heaven's on Fire"", which was a big success at the end of the eighties. And even though the new version is nothing but a bleak copy of the original, it became a hit a second time. The hit led, as usually, to media attention and now Star are on a major tour in Sweden, making money thanks to somebody else's talents.

It's a fact that cover songs almost always enter the album charts and stay there for at least a couple of weeks. How does this affect other, still unknown artists? Well, of course they too may find it tempting to give up all artistic efforts and use an already established song to reach 'fame and fortune'. And successively the art of songwriting is deteriorated, leading to a situation where no artist writes his own songs anymore, since the chance of a breakthrough seems so much bigger with already existing, fool-proof hit material. And then we definitely have a crisis, musically speaking anyway.

I don't think that anybody wants popular music to die. In the last four decades it's been a part of (mainly) young people's lives and will probably remain to be. But it's up to record buyers to decide in which form it will survive. Will it be constantly changing, developing and exciting? Or will it be tiresome, recycled and choking on the same old verses? I know what I will choose. Boycott the carbon-paper artists you too.",0
124,1026.a2.txt,Who own the right to my death?,"In this essay I'm going to discuss active euthanasia. I will first give some facts about it and then discuss it and try to explain why I want it to be legal. 
By Swedish law euthanasia is forbidden. If you help a person to die you can be prosecuted for murder or manslaughter. The law distinguish between good and evil intent, but where the dividing-line should be placed can be hard to construe. 
Euthanasia is divided into two forms: 1) Passive euthanasia, means that in the treatment of very ill and incurable patients one avoids medical or other technical treatments that can result in a prolongation of the patients suffering and life. This form of terminal care contains a considerable psychological support and systematically alleviation of the pain except from a good medical care. It's a hard decision to take for the doctor and the patient ( if possible), or the relatives of the patient. 2) Active euthanasia is measures that directly shortens the life of an patient, and that is forbidden. 
Holland was the first country in the world to legalize active euthanasia year 1993, but since 1986, though it was illegal, it has been possible to get active euthanasia. The regulations for active euthanasia in Holland is that the patients request must be of his own free will, his suffering hard and no other treatment possible. The doctor have to write a protocol that report the following: - The disease, prognos and earlier treatment of the patient. - Who the doctors are that has treated the patient, - the suffering and condition of the patient and what had been done to alleviate the suffering, - in which way the patient made his request of euthanasia, - who the witnesses are that were present and which alternatives that was discussed, - if the doctor have consulted a colleague, and in that case what the result of it was, - who performed the euthanasia, how it was done and who was present. Afterwards a medico-legal expert must go through the protocol and issue a death certificate of unnatural death. The material shall then be given to an prosecutor that decides if the euthanasia is legal. 
I think that all human beings have the right to their own life. The question you can ask then is if the right to life automatically has the consequence that everybody have the right to death? If the individual has the right to life, shouldn't he also have the right to die? I think that he has. A person that has the right to his life should have the right to his death. Suicide is not punishable in Sweden and therefore help to suicide shouldn't be punishable either, I think. If a person who wants to get euthanasia could commit suicide he wouldn't need to ask for it. That's one of the reasons why I think that a suffering person shouldn't be forced to a continuing suffering just because other persons are against euthanasia. 
No one knows if death is the end of a persons suffering and that if it is therefore a humanity to kill him. That's why I think it's up to the individual himself to make decisions about his own life. Relatives of an very ill patient should therefore not be able to make the decision about euthanasia. I think that a person can help another person to die if it is clear that it is the person's wish. Then, who do I think should make sure that no one gets killed because the killer thought it was the wish of the killed person, though it was not? I think that it is the government, the juridical system that should have the task to try the cases where a person's life gets deprived. 
When a person don't want to live anymore because of his pain and ask for help to die, because he cannot end his life himself, he cannot get legal help in Sweden. He is forced to go abroad to do it or to continue to live with the pain. I think that it is tragic. I mean, it is not an easy decision to make, to decide that you want to die, and that's one other reason why I think that we should take these demands seriously and start working to make euthanasia legal. 
It is good that passive euthanasia is legal, but for those who have some time left to live, for example an Alzheimer sick person who is relatively healthy physically but is not possible to get in contact with mentally, why do he have to live like an helpless baby if he have said that he, when he reaches a certain stage of the illness, don't want to live anymore? Why shall not his wish be respected? Why can't he die if he want to? Why can't he make the decision to end his life when he is really sick when he can do it when he is not? Who want to die a slow death? I think that he should be able to do that. 
I think that we should legalize euthanasia, but do it with strong rules surrounding it, like in Holland that I wrote earlier about. I definitely don't want a person killed ""by accident"". I think the best would be to write a contract with a person who promise to kill you when you are in the special situation where you don't want to live anymore, for example brain death. But if a contract where a person have told that he wants to die if he gets into a special situation shall become valid it must be certain that it is the persons desire. I suggest that that a good way of doing it is to do it like you write the last will, that you have persons who witness it and that it is juridical correct. If that is the case and that the circumstances that is described in the contract arises, I see no reason not to follow the wish of the individual and give the document the same legitimate as an last will. If the individual no longer is able to communicate the contract of euthanasia must be the desire of the individual. 
No, I don't think that anyone should have to suffer if he doesn't want to. It is his own decision to make that he wants to die. Why shall ""we"" say that we know better than he does and therefore he can't die? Who are we to say that he really don't want to die, and therefore not allow him to do it? Is it just of kindness or is it something else? No, legalize active euthanasia, but let it be strong rules surrounding it, and let the persons who would want to get euthanasia have it if they pass the criteria's for it.",0
125,1029.a2.txt,Systembolaget-should it remain or be closed down,"In Sweden there is a monopoly business which aims to reduce the consumption of it's products, yet at the same time provide high-quality products and good service. The products are alcoholic beverages, and the company is Systembolaget. The existence of Systembolaget is a way for the Government to restrict alcohol consumption, and there are few Swedish institutions that have been debated and critizised to the same extent that Systembolaget has. Is it perhaps now time to let the private market provide the Swedes with wine and beer? I will try to consider some pros and cons of the company's being.

The main reason for shutting down Systembolaget must be the inconvenience that it causes. How convenient would it not be, to be able to buy the wine in the same store that the rest of the dinner ingredients are being found in. It would save a lot of time and effort in many ways. There would be no worries about transportation to the nearest Systembolaget, or concerns over the opening hours, and there would probably not be any gigantic queues and long times of waiting, which now is quite common.

Another aspect that is often heard in this matter is that the Government should not act as a guardian, and that the existence of Systembolaget is restricting the freedom of people and has no rightful place in a free society. Adults ought to be able to take care of themselves, including their drinking habits.

The main argument in favour of preserving Systembolaget is that the negative consequences of the use of alcohol probably would increase if alcohol was to be sold in the private market. These consequences are among other things alcoholism, deseases and crimes of violence, and they lead to not only personal tragedies, but also heavy expenses to the society. It is likely to think that alcohol selling in the private market would increase the alcohol consumption, due to the retailers presumed effort to maximize the sales. Not only people with drinking problems, but more or less everyone would probably increase their consumption because of the great availability, which would lead to even more victims of alcoholism, and as a result of the overall increased access to alcohol, young people who are not of age would get hold of alcohol a lot easier.

Another fact that speeks for Systembolaget is the service it provides. It seems as if the company in recent years has become more service-minded and more considered about the customers. This may be a consequence of the heavy critizism Systembolaget has received, so there is an effort to please the public opinion. A visit at Systembolaget used to be a depressing experience, where you almost felt like comitting a crime when ordering the bottles by the counter. Nowadays several stores have introduced a system where the customers pick the items from the shelves like in a supermarket, a system which is a great improvement from the customers point of view. What also is in favour of the customers is the large-scale purchases of Systembolaget which provides a wide product range, including odd products. In addition to that, the staff of Systembolaget is educated in, and can offer advice of selecting a certain beverage to a given kind of food. Finally, it has been discussed whether or not to extend the opening hours to Saturdays as well. If this suggestion comes true, it is yet anoher sign of improved service.

Should Systembolaget remain as the only retailer of alcohol then? Of course I personally would want to purchase wine and beer conveniently in the closest store. If we lived in a perfect world, or in a perfect Sweden, I would immediately vote for a closure of Systembolaget. However, considering all the problems that derives from some people's use of alcohol, even in the present state of things, a closure would bring serious consequences. I cannot be egoistic about this matter and put my own convenience at first, disregarding the misery of others, as I do not think anyone should. Therefore I believe that a future existence of Systembolaget is clearly justified.",0
126,1031.a2.txt,Capital Punishment-the Governments Mortal Sin,"Opening: We all know that nobody has the right to kill another person. With that in mind I'm questioning the capital punishment. If it is wrong to kill, how come the death penalty is still performed in some countries?

Capital punishment has probably existed in all countries.
It wasn't until the 16'th century that people started to work against the death penalty. Capital punishment still exists in for example Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United States. Today organisations like the UN and Amnesty International put a lot of effort in their work against this punishment.

Supporters of the capital punishment would probably say: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. By that they mean that a person who has commit a crime should be punished with the very same crime. If you have commit a murder you should be murdered, is a common opinion among supporters. Regarding rapists, should they be raped? Should a robber be robbed?
Should the executioner also be executed? He/she has in fact killed another person, even if he/she is protected by the law.

Supporters often say that death penalty will stop people from commiting crimes of violence. But the execution is a act of crime, and we all know that violence breeds violence.
 
Death penalty is wrong, nobody has the right to kill. The punishment is irrevocable, and as long as justice isn't infallible, there is a risk of sending innocent people to death. That has happened and it could happen again.

Death penalty discriminates. It is used in a disproportionate way against poor people, minority groups and members of ethnic and religious groups.

Capital punishment is different from other forms of violence and insults, for instance torture, because it isn't either denied or hidden. It is all under government auspices. That makes killing legal.

The only thing both sides has in common is that nobody should be sentenced to death without a waterproof evidence. But it should be mentioned that 24 innocent people has been executed the last 100 years.

Violence of human rights. Genocide. War crimes. Treachery and espionage. All these crimes lead to civilians death and destruction. These crimes should have a very severe punishment. Unfortunately, lifetime in Swedish prisons often means 10 years. There should be something between Swedish ""lifetime"" and capital punishment like penal servitude for life. But everyone should have the chance to emancipation, if that is appropriate. Everybody deserves a second chance, people do change.

Final words: The capital punishment can probably be discussed for ever and ever. If you ask me, I would say that death penalty is wrong and that capital punishment makes it legal to kill. I also hope that the UN and Amnesty International will success in their battle against this punishment. 
Two mistakes does not make one right.",0
127,1032.a2.txt,Does killing ever do any good?,"Does killing ever do any good? Of course not, probably many people would answer to this. But recent polls show that the majority of the population think we should have death penalty Sweden. So, does death penalty do any good? What are the advantages, and what are the disadvantages? I have chosen to focus on the situation in the U.S., since it is the country I know of that use the death penalty where criminals have the right to a relatively fair trial.
One of the most outspoken arguments in favour of death penalty is that the criminals get what they deserve. It is a bit of an eye for an eye attitude. If you have killed someone, you should die for this. Other arguments are that perpretators of some crimes should never ever be part of society again and that it is cheaper to kill them than to keep them in prison for life. 
But who has the right to kill? And what crimes should lead to a death sentence? Who has the right to decide all this? Are the governments not killers themselves if they order an execution? And what about the executioner? He or she is, in a way, a hired killer. The only difference is that the state is his or her employer.
In the U.S., it is not unusual that criminals sentenced to death have to wait for their execution for several years. I can only imagine what they must be going through. In a way, you might think, it can be good, because it will give them the time to think about what they have done. The only problem is that if they realise how wrong they have done, it does not really matter, they will still be executed. Very few are reprieved. One very good example of this was when Karla Faye Tucker was executed last year. She had, together with her boyfriend, killed two persons about 15 years ago. She was then a drug addict. On death row, she had become religious and seemed to have had a total change of mind and values. She sued for mercy, but her request was rejected. 
I do not say though that only people who had changed should be ""let off the hook"", I do not think that there should be any death sentences at all. Firstly, it would be very hard to see which ones who really had a change of mind. Secondly, does anyone deserve to die, no matter what they have done? And, who would gain from their deaths? 
Some people claim that the relatives of the victims will feel better if the perpretator of the crime is killed. I could not really argue with this. Since I have never been in such a situation myself, I do not know what I would feel. I cannot even imagine. In a way it is understandable that the relatives want to see the perpretator dead. But that is, as I see it, why we have a legal system. You cannot take the law into your own hands, and do what your emotions tell you. Probably some relatives feel better by watching the perpretator die, but not all. Nothing will ever bring their loved ones back, no matter what. One relative of Karla Faye Tucker's victims did not want Karla to die. He saw that she had changed, and he had forgiven her. Not everybody could do this, but I still cannot understand how it could be a comfort to anyone to watch the death of someone who has deprived you of a relative or a friend. This is actually happening. In at least some states the relatives of the victims are free to watch the execution if they wish.
Of course, things happening in the U.S. are not worse than what is happening in countries where you can be executed without a fair trial, or in fact, no trial at all. I do not think that there is so much to argue about here. I think that almost all decent people agree that things like that are wrong.
As I see it, killing is always wrong, no matter if it is an individual or a state that kills. No human being should ever have the right, or the power, to decide on life or death.",0
128,1034.a2.txt,The usless art of debating,"Politicians seem to argue about just everything. Sometimes you wonder does debates between politicians lead somewhere? Do politicians of different opinions ever agree? No they don't according to me. I would say that almost all debates, political or non-political are pointless. Why is that? Because of logic or rather lack of logic in debating arguments.

You often hear people say: ""That's logical."" Is it really? Arguments that are logical can't be contradicted. Six divided by two is greater than one plus one is logical, because six divided by two equals three and one plus one equals two and three is as we know greater than two. That argument can't be contradicted. It's logical. The argument ""Liberalism is better than socialism because personal freedom is more important than the common good"" is not logical. You could argue that it is and I would agree if you could logically prove that personal freedom is more important than the common good. I would say that you had mixed your feelings and values with your logic. You value personal freedom higher than the common good and your conclusion is therefore based on your values not strict logic. You could never convince a devoted socialist that personal freedom is better than the common good, he would laugh at you. He would agree that six divided by two is greater than one plus one though.

So what does all this logic imply you wonder? Well, take a look at abortion for an example. Those that are against abortion often argue that it violates life which is holy. ""Life is holy? Why is that?"" I would ask. An atheist would probably not have an answer at that question. A religious person would probably answer that it's God's will, the Bible says so or he would refer to another holy scripture. ""But I don't believe in those scriptures. I don't believe in God"" I would answer. ""Can you prove his existence for me?"" The religious person probably tries to convince me of God's existence and wouldn't succeed in his attempt, because I'm a devout atheist, if you can be a devout atheist, that is. If the religious man can't prove God's existence he can't prove that human life is holy. Therefore he really can't use the argument to convince a person who is pro-choice. Had he found some logical reason to why abortion should be banned he could convince his opponent of his point. 

The life-is-holy argument is often used in the debate of Capital Punishment. As I already have proven the argument isn't logical and can of course be used, but it won't change the minds of the most stiff-necked supporters of Capital Punishment. There are other arguments against Capital Punishment that are better. For an example ""in a democracy, if it's forbidden to take a human life how can the state commit murder without being prosecuted? For if the state is under the rule of law the same rules should apply to both the state and the citizens."" That argument is more logical in its nature and therefore better to use to convince someone that Capital Punishment is something that you should be against. 

The problem with this argument is that it can't be used in a state that isn't a democracy. That may seem strange, but it isn't if you see it from a logical point of view. If a dictator orders a person to be executed, the dictator hasn't broken any rules, because he decides the rules and isn't bound by them. But dictatorship is wrong the common man would say. If that man should be asked why dictatorship is wrong he probably can't give a logical answer. Answers like ""people must have freedom"" aren't logical they're expressing values, something fundamentally different from logic.

As I explained earlier in this essay logic can't be contradicted. Values can. You can argue about abortion, capital punishment or dictatorship, but you often express values or feelings instead of logical arguments. You can't really prove your point. You may be against something you may be for something. It doesn't matter. The debate have been a waste. You probably still have the same values as before. The one you have been debating with probably still have his values intact. If people looked for more logical arguments they hopefully would question their own ideas and values and discussion would become more than a pastime.",0
129,1036.a2.txt,Some Children have to Work,"For about one and a half year ago, it was discovered that one of H&M's subcontractors used child labourer in their fabric. The media gave a picture of H&M as an irresponsible concern which permitted employment of children just to be able to sell clothes cheap and it was proposed that people should boycott them. Then, the H&M concern answered that they did not know anything about it and now when they knew, they should immediately stop it by closing the fabric. Of course, children should not be working. But one should not just shut up the fabric where they are working without considering the alternatives for them, which may be another even harder work or just hanging around on the street. Should not children have the right to work if that is the only way for them to make a living and to pay their school charges?

In this case, it was naturally easiest for the H&M concern to dissociate themselves from the whole thing and close down the fabric. The question is if that was the best thing happening for the children. That is not obviously the case. They actually work on a voluntary basis and most of the children are happy to have a job so that they can help to earn their family's living and go to school. All children do not have the same opportunity to go to school as we in the Western World have. Children in poor families may need to pay school charges which their parents can not afford. Some children may not even have a school to go to. Then, it may be better for them to have a job than to have nothing at all to do. As a matter of fact, some parents want their children to work, just so they will not have the chance to start with drug habits on the street.

When I am saying that a work may be good for poor children, I do not mean all kind of works. I know that there are a lot of very hard, abominable places of work and such work should not be permitted at all. One should endeavour to stop all employment of children but during the circumstances today, it is impossible. People in developing countries do not have the same standard as we have. Consequently, their children may have to work.

In conlusion, employment of children is not good. However, it is the best thing during certain circumstances. My point is that one can not just shut up their place of work on the pretext of ""children are not supposed to work"", without doing something else about it. As long as we do not help them in some other way, so that they can make a living and go to school without working - they do need their works.",0
130,1039.a2.txt,POSTPONEMENT IS WRONG,"-Do what you have to do right now, or you will make time disappear.

INTRODUCTION
We all know it's wrong to avoid things like cleaning and studying. So why do we always postpone it until it's absolutely necessary? It only makes us feel bad and the things we want to avoid get worse.
I have discovered, by my own experience, that postponement makes time disappear.
If you have something you must do, every single minute you postpone it is useless. Time is lost until you have done it.
THINGS WE LOVE TO POSTPONE
A thing we definitely avoid as long as possible is cleaning. I have never met anyone who likes cleaning.
Cleaning is not difficult but it takes time and it's boring. But it's great when it's done, and the longer we avoid doing it, the worse it gets.
The things we want to avoid often have those points in common. For example exercise. Eventhough some people actually enjoy it, most of us make up the most stupid excuses for not having to do it: 
* ""Oh, I have recently had a cold""
* ""Real trainingshoes cost too much""
* ""I haven't got time""
We have heard them all... But why do we act like this? Exercise doesn't have to take a lot of time, and it will definitely make us feel better.
I think that every time we postpone something we unconsciously hope that it will disappear. We hope that we won't ever have to do it.
Haven't we all felt that way about studying... Let's say you have an exam in three weeks. At first you think you have plenty of time. You can even repress the fact that you will have to study. But it won't take long until you will start thinking of the exam. You feel that you should study. And when the guilt has arrived, it's there to stay. Nothing is fun to do, because you know what you really ought to be doing. But you still repress it. Not as sucessfully though. 
Soon you won't be able to plan anything: ""I can't go to that great movie, it will take three hours. I can't waste that much time"" But will you study? No. Probably you will think ""I'll switch on the TV, just for a minute."" and you will end up watching boring TV-shows for four hours. Shows you normally never would watch. You would rather read a book. But in this situation, starting to read a book feels like a step too big. Than you would admit that you won't study the next hour. It feels better to watch TV or maybe read a magazine ""just for a minute"". (= Hours)
When it's time to go to bed you realize four hours have disappeared. To no use.
And if you had went to the movie, you wouldn't have been able to enjoy it. You would just have felt guilty. That day is lost forever. So you go to bed. But will you sleep well? No. You lie there, thinking of the exam. Now you kind of start worrying: ""How will I ever learn what I have to. I have so little time left to study.""
Eventually you will start studying. But you are under stress, and that makes it more difficult to learn things. 
If you begin studying two weeks earlier you gain much more:
* You have enough time if something is more difficult than you thought it would be.
* You will learn better when you aren't under time pressure.
* You can do other things too, you won't have to study every hour of the day.
* You will have time to repeat, and you will remember what you have learned better.
And most important:
* You feel much better when you set to work right away.

CONCLUSION
Time does definitely disappear while you postpone things. Because even if you can postpone doing something, you can't avoid thinking of it. It will affect your life, because you can't really make it disappear. And don't forget that the longer we postpone things, the worse they get.",0
131,1041.a2.txt,Silence,"The first sheet of paper was not forgotten, it was a gift. I wanted to give you a second of silence, of no words, of empty paper. It could be the most valuable part of this essay, because what I want to say is that we need these small moments of tranquility.
I have been walking around in silence for some hours now, among silent trees and sleeping mountains, and I am filled with air and emptyness. Back inside, I looked at ""silence"" in Longmans Dictionary, and found the sentence ""The complete silence of the forest at night"". It made me wonder -Has everyone experienced that complete silence? Maybe most people has not experienced complete silence at all, and maybe they do not miss it. But still I think that all of us needs to empty ourselves from time to time, like a vacuum cleaner, you need to make space for new thoughts and views. People usually agree with this, complaining about overcrowded aching heads, but they do not do anything about it. It is easier to just go on, talking, arranging, making the small things work and hiding from the big things in the noise. These big things and questions are droven away down to the stommach, where they can lye murmuring. And if no one hears their murmours, it will rise to screams and gastric ulsers.
There are a lot of gastric ulsers walking around in the world today. Not all of them, but some, may be longing for silence. Not only physical silence, but inner silence. Watch out, we are getting into the dangerous ""peace in mind areas"", not far from horoscops and crystals. Normal people have to be careful these days. Silence is an issue for New agers and ""letters-to-the-editor-ladies"". Local papers need to have one or two letters a week about the immoral, noisy youth, but people of power will not notice them. Maybe we would need to put a price on silence, to make it fit into the buisness pages. It is discussed to put a price on air, so why not? Silence has to have a market value, get a profile, fit in on Internet, maybe some silent silence commercials? 
Or just wait in silence. Wait and see what will come. I often do so before I go to bed, just listening to my breath. There are a lot of things flying around me and I give them some time to come down. Eventually there is only the breath left and I can go to sleep. I think many people are meditating, contemplating, without knowing. Why do you think parents of small children spend so long time in the bathroom? The Corean boddhist master Song San is also meditating. When he got his enlightment after ages of meditation, his teacher told him to be quiet for three years to make it deeper. He says that talking takes a lot of energy, so if you really want to concentrate on something, try to be quiet. 
But it is not easy to be quiet when there are so many words attacking incessantly. Everyone wants to send out their message, their opinions, their views, and there are not enough ears to catch all the empty words. There are not eyes to read all the essays that has already been written a thousand times before, I think that schools has got some responsibility in all this, when they keep filling their students with things that they do not want to hear. ""Knowledge is the lightest burden to bear!"" is their mantra, but I do not agree. It is heavy for me to carry around knowlwedge of logarithms, that I will never need. Some lessons of silence could have been more interesting. I am not suggesting a voiceless society, I love to talk and I would go crazy among only Song Sans. But some silence could make talking more interesting, like fasting can make you appreciate food. Things could turn up behind the deperate need of keeping the conversation. 
I have produced even more words now to fill the poor, noisy world, just to suggest you to give yourself and your ears some quiet seconds.

But the rest is silence.",0
132,1043.a2.txt,Hamas - on a mission from God?,"The Hamas are Arab Muslims who claim that the Jews living in Israel have stolen their country, and that they are on a mission from God to get it back. In the beginning of the 1990's they declared a bombing-campaign. Because the Israelis are superior when talking about the military and weapons, and the Hamas most definitely would not gain anything going to war against them, they instead tried to scare the Jews by using ""human bombs"". A human bomb is someone who places explosives on him, goes to an area crowded with people, and blows himself up. Why would anyone want to do this, and why would anyone want someone else to do this?
The human bombs were usually poor, deeply religious, hard-working men who were supporting families, not only consisting of a wife and children, but often older relatives as well. The Hamas investigated and looked for men with these kinds of ""weaknesses"" and then they went after them. One person or a group of people from the Hamas got in touch with the recruit and told him about their mission from God that he could be a part of. Furthermore they told him that if he went along with the project, God would be waiting for him. He would go to heaven where wine runs like water through the heavenly rivers, and so would his family and friends when their time came, and in heaven he, and all of the other martyrs, would be given 99 virgins each, for pleasure. In addition to this he was also given the promise that his family would get a large sum of money when he died, so that they could have a better life. As a result a young husband and father would die, killing a lot of innocent people. The Hamas turned perfectly honest men into murderers. 
The meeting with the Hamas and all of the mental preparation before the bombing was secret, and the men kept it to themselves. The families were not aware of anything until the deaths occurred. Strangely enough, the awful death that almost every human bomb met was not something that his relatives mourned. On the other hand, there was usually a feast with neighbours invited, where everybody celebrated the martyr, the man who died for his religion and his family. But, then there were human bombs that failed in their mission( not all of the bombs worked), or survived. Instead of being celebrated as martyrs they will now live the rest of their lives in prison thinking about why God rejected them. Many of these men committed or will commit suicide because they were/are convinced that God does not want them, and that all they have done is let their families down. 
All of the promises that the Hamas made were nice, and I would probably kill myself too if I was a fundamental Muslim and was given the opportunity to get all that security. However, what I find extremely disturbing about this, is that ordinary mortals were giving these promises without being able to guarantee any of them. They were all alive, and nobody knows what happens after death, or if there is a heaven. And a dead man can not check if his family has received the sum of money that the Hamas said they would be given. So, a human bomb may not die afraid or unhappy, yet, he dies leaving this world much sooner than intended. Also, the fact that the deeply religious men in the Hamas would go out and encourage suicide and murder, feels incredibly hypocritical to me.
And what about the leaders of this terrorist-group. They were never revealed or captured( they never showed their holy faces in public, instead they used messengers) during this bombing-campaign, and they are still out there recruiting new ""bombs"". If they want to get their country back and if they actually believe in their own promises, why do not they become human bombs themselves? Personally, I think that they are power-hungry, evil cowards, taking advantage and deceiving innocent men. Moreover, I think they seem unbelievably stupid, since they think that they can order people to kill, and still say( and believe) that they are on a mission from God.",0
133,1044.a2.txt,Ding-A-Dong... The Bell Tolls for the Eurosong.,"Every year, usually in the end of May, millions of people gather around their TV sets to rejoice in a spectacular cacophony of lighthearted music- the Eurovision Song Contest.
For decades, this festival has enchanted viewers all over Europe, and also in Turkey and Israel. Not because the music in itself is particularly good, but because the Eurosong (or ""schlager"") genre is such a fascinating phenomenon. We have seen many a memorable costume and heard catchy tunes galore through the years.

Since the fall of Communism and the birth of all the new nations- the Baltic states and the Balkan countries, the contest has grown bigger than ever. Everybody wants to join the festival of shimmering, glamourous western splendour.
Although the Eurovision Song Contest is supposed to be unpolitical, it often reflects society in one way or another. In the affluent eighties, the songs were mostly happy, frolicky little numbers. In the nineties the songs have been generally more serious. In 1990, several songs dealt with the Berlin Wall- Norway's song was called ""Brandenburger Tor"", Switzerland contributed with ""Keine Mauer Mehr"", and Italy won with ""Insieme 2000"", a hopeful vision of a future united Europe. 
In 1993, Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia-Hercegovina participated for the first time- all three songs dealing with the Balkan war.
When the Bosnian jury delivered their results over the phone directly from Sarajevo, the cheering of the audience was deafening.
This shows what an important role the festival can play, in spite of its superficiality.
In the last few years, however, it has all started to change. In quite a negative way, I am afraid.

The rules of the contest used to be simple. Every artist or group were to sing in one of the official languages of their nation, although they were allowed to include eight foreign words in their lyrics. The song should preferably mirror the culture of the country.
Independent jury groups from every participating nation selected the winner. These groups were able to listen to the songs several times, thus examening them carefully.

Recently, though, the rules have been dramatically changed. Since 1998, the winner is selected by the viewers themselves, through telephone voting. This was supposed to be a more democratic way of choosing the victor, and also a way to attract more viewers by making them interactive.
Personally, I find this new rule utterly horrible. Since the artists now have to appeal to the TV audience, looks, sexual allusions and spectacular effects have become much more important. Is there anyone who truly believes that Sweden's Charlotte Nilsson won in 1999 because of her lovely singing voice? 
Moreover, the unique Eurosong genre is slowly dying, as the artists try to resemble contemporary MTV-pop-singers. Last but not least, this method is not very democratic at all. People very seldom choose their favourite song in an objective way. For example, Turkey did extremely well in 1998, although their song was really rather dull. Why? Well, they got thousands of votes from Germany, were there is a considerable Turkish minority...

An even more epoch-making change was made in 1999. Every country was now free to choose any language they wanted for their lyrics. This was, of course, another attempt to make the contest more democratic. Undoubtedly, the English-speaking countries have had a great advantage, since almost everybody understands, and can relate to their lyrics. For instance, in 1993 Ireland won, closely follwed by the United Kingdom and Malta.
Furthermore, some people have emphasized the injustice of the fact that a country like Switzerland has got four languages to choose from whereas, for example, Denmark has only got one.
It has also been argued that the recurrent failure of certain countries like Finland and Cyprus is due to the fact that their languages are not rhythmically suitable for this type of music. (In Finland's case, though, this is apparently not true, since Estonia has been tremendously succesful although the two languages are very closely related.)

In 1999, all the Nordic artists sang in English, Bosnia-Hercegovina's contribution was in French, and the German group chose to sing in German, English, Turkish and Hebrew in the same song- thus appealing to the voters in all these countries.
I find all this very sad. I have always enjoyed learning a few phrases in strange languages by watching the Eurovision Song Contest. Now, the cultural aspect of the festival has disappeared completely. In 1999, Norway's contribution was performed in English, by a black hip-hop-boy from the Netherlands. I have got nothing against a multicultural society, but in the world of the Eurosong, national characteristics have to be preserved.
Besides, Eurosong lyrics are very seldom profound and well-expressed. On the contrary, they are often terribly banal, which is all right all long as you do not understand them...

I think the importance of the Eurovision Song Contest is often underrated. It is a unique event, where the European states can meet and learn about each other, regardless of political ideologies or religious disagreements.It proves that we can get together in the name of peace and fun. Such a festival must not be commercialized! Therefore, I truly hope that the arrangers will listen to reason and go back to the former system- for the sake of love, peace and the good old Eurosong.",0
134,1048.a2.txt,Capital Punishment,"In my essay I would like to argue about, if a person or the authority of a state has the right to decide weather a criminal should be deprived its life or not, and how this method does effect ordinary people and the society. I will also discuss what is the difference between criminals and the authority of a country that use capital punishment, as a legally punishing method, and what I thing would be a better alternative instead of this penalty.
Capital punishment is the execution of a criminal who's sentence of death has been decided by a court. Capital Punishment was once a common penalty throughout the world. And it was inflected for a large number of crimes. However nowadays this kind of punishment has reduced more or less, as a result of people's struggle against old systems and old regimes. The World is now divided between countries that have abolished death penalty like Sweden, and those countries that have retained it, for instance Iraq, Iran, many deferent Muslim countries and USA, the later one has employed this method more than any other countries in the whole world.
Before arguing for or against this penalty we have to take in consideration that every single person has the right to be treated faire in his/her life. It is every individual's basic human right, no matter what. Justice in a person's life could signify two factors, that is, no man has the right take life of another person's, and that a murder should or deserve to die. 
Those who have abolished death penalty have long time ago come to the conclusion, that this method is wrong and not effective in the long ran. For instance in the USA, the crimes are increasing more and more in spite of using capital punishment. Still there are a lot of countries that use this extremely cruel and grim way of punishing to preserve the justice in a society.
In contrast I personally don't believe that capital punishment has that much power to deter people from committing crimes. The reason is that statistically there is no evidence that indicate this statement. In contrary those who have killed a person, it is said, that are rarely committing any crimes when released or paroled. Otherwise there is evidence that those who have committed other crimes such as burglary, drug crimes and those who abuse children sexually are committed the same crime over and over again, as son as they are realest.
I'm of strong opinion that capital punishment gives the wrong impression to the ordinary, likewise it even could effect their life in domestic matters. I thing also that people's behaviour reflect a country's policy. Specifically if we take USA as an example, that have retained capital punishment, has the highest rate crimes involving a person's death. As I understand people in this country believe that they have the right to protect themselves by possessing guns. In this case they act like the government of their country. 
I believe that there must other effective penalty than capital punishment. Violence never solve any problem. In min opinion there is no differences between people or government of countries that are in favour of death penalty, and criminals who has committed homicide on a person who is not in self defend, because they actually do the same thing, they commit the same crime. Although the first one, that is the authority of a country, is doing it legally, for the sake of justice, in purpose of deterring people, and to create a better society of safety. This is what I think, that they think is the benefits of having capital punishment.
 I believe that countries, that have maintained capital punishment, argue also that this way of punishing has a unique power to scare people from committing crimes. I am of strong opinion that this is not the case. I think capital punishment is used because it is cheap and it might avoid vendetta and also because the criminals are sometime considered as dangerous to the society. 
Thus I consider this whole system completely wrong and unnecessary when I think better of it. There must be other methods that not contend to the right of human, namely imprisonment for long time or imprisonment for lifetime. It doesn't gain a country to get ride of criminals. In well organised prisons, prisoners would be economic assets. These prisoners should be required to do unpaid work within the prison, which is for the benefits of a country. 
 I think the consequences of capital punishment are that people lose confidence for the authority of their country. Citizens might think that if it is legislative for the authority to deprive a person its life, then it might be OK for them too to take the law in their hand if they find it necessary in a particle situation. In this way they create a violent society instead of bringing order and discipline to their countries.
I agree with those who argue that criminals should suffer for what they have done, and I think that they would suffer enough, by being deprived of their personal liberty, when they are given lifetime sentence.
Finally I would like to emphasise that, to use force against a criminal doesn't preserve justice or create a better society. If capital punishment is used, the authority are criminals too. Furthermore violence doesn't solve any problems in the long run. 
Nobody should have the right to take life of another person, no matter for what purpose, and in any situation, because it stride against human right and it also insult human dignity.",0
135,1049.a2.txt,Increased Quality of Life-Something for You?,"Are you one of those who work eight hours a day five days a week and come home almost exhausted in the evenings? More and more of working people are under stress at work and several even have to take psycho-drugs to cope with it. Not many are able to work until retirement age, our need of rest is not provided for. While many working people are suffering from burnout there are also about four hundred thousand people that are out of work. A solution to these problems could be to introduce a thirty hours' working week in Sweden.

Thirty hours work a week would be six hours a day, which is two hours less than today. These two hours the employees could spend with their family or by themselves to rest. With shorter working-hours there would be more time to look after close relationships and families would have time to other things together than the usual everyday duties. Time is a commodity in short supply in many families, which affects the children above all. Less working hours would perhaps even contribute to prevent divorces when people have more time for each other. More spare time would give people opportunity to devote themselves to hobbies or to exercises as well. When people feel that they have time to do other things than duties they will become more positive in general and we would get a more harmonious and healthy people.

Less working hours would also contribute to increased equality in society since it would even up the difference in working hours between men and women. Today women often voluntary work part time to have time to take care of the housework. Over eighty per cent of part time workers are women. If six hours' work a day will become standard in Sweden, men and women could do equal work at home and women would get better positions on the labour market.

Labour market would also offer more jobs that form from shortening of work. If all three million working people would shorten their workweek with ten hours, seven hundred and fifty thousand new jobs would be available. Those who have been out of work could then get a job and lighten the work burden for the others.

It is obvious that work shortening favours the individual, but what about the employers and the society? It might be difficult to count the gains of work shortening in money, but in the long run I think everybody will make a profit on it. Just think about the redundant twenty per cent of the population that are unemployed and would get a chance to get into the labour market.

Another example is that less tired and healthier employees lead to fewer people being put on the sick-list. This would result less sickness benefits having to be paid by the company. The employees will presumably also find more pleasure in their jobs and work more efficiently. During the short day they would not have time to be so tired or bored.

Working hours and occupational injuries are connected. Most occupational injuries take place in the later part of the day when people are most tired. Many occupational injuries never pass and result in high costs for society in form of medical treatment and rehabilitation. A shortening of working hours would very likely imply that accidents at places of work would reduce and fewer people would be absent due to long time illness. 

The environment would also benefit by work shortening. To transform Sweden into a more environment friendly country requires time and commitment from the individual citizen, time that would be gained from work shortening. People might consider they have time to take the bus instead of the car to work, or sort garbage at home.

It is about time that shorter working weeks are introduced in Sweden, it would be a gain for society in general in form of reduced costs for unemployed, early retired and sick people. For the people less working hours would signify quality of life, time for the family, increased equality and a chance to contribute to a better environment.",0
136,1050.a2.txt,Boy bands - for better or worse?,"Ever since the Beatles in the 1960:s there have been boy bands, which millions of girls all over the world worship, even though, in the beginning it was quite innocent and the music was still in focus. In the last decade there has been a dramatic change and the music is no longer the main issue when it comes to boy bands. What makes them popular now is their image and looks. It has many times been debated whether these bands are good for teenagers and children, who devote their lives to their idols, or if they can be damaging.
Boy bands keep popping up, some of them are independent and make it on their own, but most of them are completely created by a record company, who spend a huge amount of money on them. The artists themselves rarely write their own music and in many cases they are not even very good at music. All that matters to the company is money and they do their best at making as much money as possible out of their new boys and this industry is constantly growing.
The age of the boy band fans is now lower than ever, it varies from about six to fourteen - fifteen years old. Is it natural for little girls of six or seven to adore boy bands to the extent that they dress and act like teenagers, and stand at the front row at concerts, almost being killed by the enormous pressure? Some people might say that at that young age girls don't take it very seriously and that they know it's not real ""love"", but I would like to say that as soon as children start growing up too soon and missing their entire childhood, it is indeed unnatural.
Millions of girls, and of course some boys, spend many years following their favourite boy band on tours and media performances and buying every magazine and every poster with their ""darling"". This summer I went to a Boyzone- concert in Oslo and heard about an English girl at the age of 11 or 12, who had been to over 200 different Boyzone performances during the last couple of years. Her mother came with her on her trips around the world and seemed to think this was perfectly normal. At every concert they would be standing right in front of the stage, screaming when the boys appeared and singing along in every song. Of course, one could say that the girl was given the opportunity to see many different places and meeting new friends all over the world, all with the same interest as herself, which is very positive, but I don't think it's healthy to devote all of your time and attention to members of a boy band.
What happens for example if a boy band splits up? When the biggest boy band at the time, Take That, split up a few years ago, many girls tried to commit suicide and therapy groups and hot lines had to be set up in England and many other countries, because of many girls' disappointment and frustration.
This devotion is not only psychologically unhealthy, it can also be physically dangerous. To stand in front of the stage with thousands of hysterical fans around her can be lethal to a young girl if she's not careful. If she falls she might be stepped on, or the huge pressure and the heat, along with the excitement, can make her faint. Everybody who has ever been to one of these concerts knows what I am talking about. They have all seen the girls being picked up from the screaming crowd and carried out unconscious.
The chance of a boy band fan's biggest dream (that her favourite member will get to know and fall in love with her) to come true is so little, it hardly exists and the day that she realises this she's bound to be incredibly disappointed. However, boy bands do offer girls many nice experiences at concerts and fan gatherings, but is it really worth it? Is it worth all the money, the risk of getting hurt and the lost childhood years? I think parents of young girls should be aware of the dangerous aspects of boy band concerts and make sure that their children don't lose themselves in the big ""boy band circus"". Everybody should also think about how we like the music industry to be. Music ought to be about people enjoying themselves and making other people happy, without a great big music company taking advantage of little girls and making it into strict business.",0
137,1055.a2.txt,Let The Elderly Stay At Home,"I have been given an essay assignment in my A-level composition class I am taking at Uppsala University. The assignment is to write paper in which I argue for or against something. I have chosen to argue for something that sooner or later will concern us all.
People feel safe and secure in an environment they know well and have lived in for a long period of time, which is often the case for senior citizens. When you grow old you want to be close to family and friends and that continues to be of great importance when you can't live alone and take good care of yourself any longer. Therefore I think that the family, not the state, should look after the elderly.
I think the main reason for taking care of our older family members, like parents and grand parents, should be like returning a favor. The older generations took care of us, the younger, and fed us, loved us, sheltered us, shared their wisdom with us and helped us to become the persons we are today. When a person grow old and maybe can't care for himself/herself in a good way any longer, it is the younger generation's turn to look after his/her best. The family shouldn't feel obligated to do so, but think of it as a way of showing gratitude and appreciation. In my opinion the best way of showing this is to take the elderly into our homes and make them feel important in our lives, instead of putting them in an institution, where they easily become just one in the crowd.
Two words of great significance in this discussion are the words important and safe i.e. to feel important and to feel safe. Elderly often feel a little useless and forgotten when they don't have a daily job, where they made a difference, to go to any more. To take that person into your home can make him/her feel needed and important. He/she can help look after the children, if there are any, cook and help with other house-hold chores; this would make the elder feel that he/she is playing an important role in the family. Taking part in family life with people you know well creates a feeling of safety; you know what the other family members likes and dislikes, what makes them happy and what makes them angry. Of course there are institutions that are home-like, but they can never replace a loving home where you have to fear to be forgotten. In a home for elderly it is easy to become one in the crowd and just get the basic needs satisfied - for example painkillers for an aching knee. In a home the elder gets more personal care from people who know them, without having to study the medical files.
Many times family-care can give better care than an institution, just because the fact that the family members understand and are familiar with each other. I think even society would gain on family-care; there would only have to be institutions for those without a family to turn to or for those with great medical needs. Of course the whole responsibility can't be put on the single family, it might not have the means for it, but with some financial aid and a nurse, or other person in that field, who could do house visits and relieve the pressure, if any, on the family, it should be possible for elderly to live in a home as long as they wish.
My conclusion of my opinions is that we shouldn't forget our elderly and shouldn't just put them in homes for aged for ""storage""; they deserve better. We should honor the elderly and give them the respect and appreciation they have earned. Old people have gone through a lifetime from which they have gained experience and wisdom which we can learn a lot from. Let the elderly be a natural part of our lives and take them into our homes.",0
138,1056.a2.txt,Does anyone really deserve to die?,"Does anyone has the right to decide about other people's lives? The law says that ""you shall not kill"", but if you break the law you can be convicted to death by the law, then it is legally killing! How can that make sence? Can we defend lives by taking lives? The capital punishment is carried out in many different ways in different countries, some methods more cruel than others, but I will refere to the capital punishment in the United States.

The death penalty assures the execusion of some innocent people, even though it occurs in extremely small number of cases- it does happen! This almost raises the criminal or his/her actions to a moral equality, not lower the state to the moral level of the criminal. The most important aspect here is that the executed prisoner can never be given a second chance and according to the 1987 Stanford University survey at least 23 Americans have been wrongly executed in the 20th century.1

When a person is convicted to death the case is reviewed by other courts and can also be appealed to higher instances. Normally the convict has to wait for about six to eight years before executed, which is kind of cruel. During this time the condemned has a lot of time to think and to change from the person he/she was when commited the crime. So the people that is executed might be quite different from the condemned ones. In some occasions the execution also has not led to instant death, but caused further cruel suffering for the convict.

What about the victims family and freinds though, you might think. This criminal (or criminals) has caused a great deal of grief to them! If the person who commited this crime has to pay the same price as the victim (victims) some justice have been brought. That might give some comfort and relief to the family and friends and this also stops him from harming another person ever again, that must be good!? Is it? Of course he must pay and take responsibility for what he has done but that still doesn't justify the act of taking this persons life. If they want to see this person dead I can understand the feeling but not the acting- to actually go through with it. Then they are almost just as bad as this criminal with the exception that thay don't have to ""do the dirty work"", they can just sit down and watch if they like. How can anyone want to see a killing of another person?! It does not bring the victim (victims) back and does not help the victims who survived, or relieve the pain and loss of the victims who didn't.

Many people that are pro-death penalty means that the purpose is to discourage murderers to commit these crimes, but sometimes it even have the opposite effect! Most of people that commits serious crimes such as murders does not rationally plan the crime. They commit this in panic, under influence of drugs or when strong emotions take the overhand- they don't think before they act. Then they don't concider whether they can be convicted to death penalty or not and then the purpose doesn't have any effect. 

These people are people that most of the times can be rehabilitated to normal lives and actually be an asset to the society. Some of them even work with helping other criminals rehabilitating and get back on the right track. It is evident from statistical studies and reports of prison officials that imprisoned murderers are among the best behaved prisoners and that they rarely commit new crimes, and almost never a homicide, if released.2

Capital punishment is also discriminating. People who is convicted to capital punishment are often poor people, little-educated people or belongs to ethnic minorities that doesn't have the opportunity to get good lawyers and a fair trial.

Talking about the financial parts there is another aspect that you might think of. The expense for holding a criminal in prison for a lifetime. One can think that execution must coast less. However the coast of apparatues and maintenance of procedures attending to the capital punishment (appeals etc.), way overweighs the expense of maintain the criminal in prison.3

So if the penalty doesn't really serve it's purpose and many of these criminals can be turned around to ""better"" people, realising the consequences of there actings and in addition to that the method coasts more than the alternative of imprisonment, what can be such a strong motive for death penalty? I cannot see anything that strong but the justifying to the victims family and friends and the way I see it that is not as strong as to motivate the act of taking a person's life, how cruel the crime he commited ever might have been.

139,1057.a2.txt,Do you believe it's true?,"What is really true in life? Why do I exist? These are questions that we all have to deal with, and what I think only can be answered by a deeper belief of some kind. I will here try to meet some of the argumentations against Christianity and why I think it is the right religion? 
One of the objections toward Christianity is all the evil things that happen in the world today, as wars, famine, and natural catastrophes. If there is a God, how can he allow this to happen? I don't have a straight answer to this, only small explanations. First of all, we all have a choice to make if we want to share what we've got with our neighbour. We decide how to act in different relationships, both in big as in small -person to person- contacts. I also believe there is an evil power that constantly tries to influent us to do bad things, and to think of your own good before anyone else's. When it comes to natural catastrophes, I believe that as inhabitants of the world, we have affected the nature balance so that we in some cases are responsible for these ourselves. I also want to point out all the good things in life that speaks in favour for God as creator, only look at our beautiful nature with all living things. I can not believe that a ""big bang"" can have created this complex world. We can also look upon ourselves and how amazing our body works in every little detail. 
Somebody will argue that Christians today are very divided in some issues and disagree with one an other on many things. We all have the Bible to lead us so it ought to be easy. Interpretation is the difficulty. The Bible can be interpreted in different ways and that is one answer. An other is that we are all so different in the way that we like to worship, some like it in peace and calm and others like it loud and joyful. It is hard to mix those within the same church. Still, I think the Christians are more divided than what is good for them and we ought to be more accepting of each others differences. 
Some might say that the Christian church is too far away from their ordinary life and that they feel too ""unspiritual"" to go there. The church is suppose to be a dwelling as like the home where both sadness and happiness show, and where we can talk about every thing and take care of each other. I'm afraid that the church isn't like this utopia as neither are ordinary homes. Churches sometimes show a surface that gives other people a wrong impression that everything is perfect, but of course there is not. It is like a family with ups and downs. Basically, we are also afraid of showing our inner feelings. The good thing is that as a person in a congregation, you can take a part in how you want the church to function. 
Why Christianity among all the religions? The greatest difference is that you don't have to do anything. You don't have to pray six times a day, give away all your money and go around doing good deeds all day. All you have to do is to say ""yes"" to Jesus. To believe that he died in stead of you for your sins, and that he rose on the third day. We can't do anything to earn the right to be holy and good all through, as God is. This is the biggest difference, and the best if you ask me, between Christianity and other beliefs. We also have a helper in the Holy Spirit that sort of guides us through our lives and makes our faith more personal as like a relationship. Finally we believe in the paradise when we die. This is our hope. 
Finally, you may think that everyone can believe in what they think is right, and you will not interfere. But think for a while. What if Christianity is the only way? To be a Christian is not to blindly do everything expected and right without thinking. I try my faith with many things and issues that comes up in my life, but so far I haven't found anything to make me give it up. It doesn't mean I have a perfect explanation to everything, because what it all comes down to in the end is to believe.",0
140,1058.a2.txt,Slavery is not dead!,"Although slavery is outlawed by several of the most widely ratified international Conventions and by legislation in almost every country, slavery is not dead. Estimates working for ILO (International Labour Organisation) and the United Nations put the number of child slaves into tens of millions. Children are regularly found working in manifestly hazardous and arduous situations. They haul wagons underground in coalmines, they draw molten glass in stifling temperatures, they squat on the workshop floor for many hours making carpets for example. This form of slavery, children working with there own lives at stake to almost no money at all, has to be stopped for several different reasons.
One reason is the fact that to hard work ruins a child physically. Children are susceptible to all of the dangers that are faced by adult workers when placed in the same situation, but they are more seriously affected because they differ from adults in their anatomical, physiological characteristics. The health effect can be devastating, causing irreversible damage to their physical development. To use unnatural positions or carry heavy loads at work can permanently distort or disable growing bodies. Children suffer more readily from chemical hazards and radiation than do adults, and children also have less resistance to diseases. Children are less aware of their rights and they have never got a chance to learn how to defend themselves, which makes it easier to hire children to do dangerous and laborious work 
But children doing hard work in poor working conditions to a disgraceful salary do not only suffer physically. They are also subjected to psychological suffer. Children suffer deeper psychological damage when they are denigrated. The expectations of the children working are often high and they work under hard pressure. In most cases far to high regarded to their age. 
With all the information above in mind you ask your self why and how can so many children today, in 1999, be exposed to hazardous work? Poverty emerges as the most compelling reason why children work. Poor households need the money. But it can not be said, however, that poverty necessary causes child labour. The picture varies. There are regions in poor countries where child labour is extensively practised while in other equally poor regions it is not. Kerala State in India, for example, though poor, has in fact abolished child labour.
So irrespective of poverty in a country is it important that a lot of efforts are put to eliminate hazardous child labour, independently of poverty reduction. It is important that the children, with help from the government working through local organisations, are offered a choice. Otherwise it easily gets into at bad circle. If a child for example do not has the chance to attend school the possibility for him/her to get a well-paid job is almost impossible. The child grows into an adult trapped in unskilled and badly paid jobs. He/she later get children that he/she cant provide for...they have to work in order the stay alive or work off family depts. The children grow up whiteout education, get children... 
To conclude hazardous work not only harms children physically, it also exposes the children to great psychological pressure and restrain them from getting an education. I completely agree with UNICEF's article 32 for children rights, abridged saying that:
""The child has the right to be protected from work that threatens his or her health, education or development""
It should be every child's right to develop in freedom and get the opportunity to education and a worthy life. We can not allow slavery!",0
141,1060.a2.txt,"Someone, please stop Mr Lucas! - or how to save the Star Wars saga","Introduction
I was seven years old when I saw the first Star Wars movie, and I was really excited about it. My brother had already seen the film and had told me so much about it, that it almost felt as if I had already seen it myself. It did not take long before I got to see the following episodes of the trilogy too, and I loved them just as much as I loved the first one. I guess you could say that I am a grown up now, but I still love the Star Wars Trilogy just as much as I did when I was a little girl and my favourite toy was my Luke Skywalker-doll. This is why I am afraid that Mr George Lucas is about to destroy it completely and take away all the magic and excitement in what I would say is the greatest adventure since Tolkien's ""Lord of The Ring"".

As the technology of film making and special effects developed, Star Wars began to look more and more like an episode from the Muppet Show, and that development has continued. I am not the only one with these thoughts. On the Internet you can find piles of sites with names like ""The Ewoks destroyed Return of the Jedi. Do not let Jar-Jar do the same to The Phantom Menace!"" and ""Delete Jar-Jar now"" (Jar-Jar is one of the sickeningly cute elements of the new Star Wars film). Is it not time to force Mr Lucas to retire before he destroys the Star Wars saga completely and turns it into an obnoxious Disney movie?

The deterioration
The first Star Wars movie was pleasantly free from cute details apart from one or two little beeping droids. But at least the droids had some kind of meaning to the rest of the film. In the next episode Yoda turned up, and although he filled an important role in the saga, his most important role seemed to be cute. The last episode of the original trilogy was filled with funny looking aliens of all kinds and shapes, and was almost completely destroyed by the furry little Ewoks that stumbled around and made sweet noises. 

But that was just the beginning. Not long ago Mr Lucas decided to release the Star Wars trilogy again, this time in new versions with all the scenes that until now had been impossible to carry through. This was probably to put the audience in the right mood for the new episode that was planned to be released in short. Some new scenes actually had significance for the film, but most of them showed funny things like people being thrown of animals and so on. Things that the saga could have done without. Even the Wampa Ice creature that almost kills Luke in the episode, and of whom we only saw in the arm in the old verion of the film, was furry and cute.

Then the time had come for the new episode of the Star Wars saga: The Phantom Menace, to be released. This episode took place before the original trilogy and I was very excited about it, but scared to death at the same time. The question was not if, but in what way Mr Lucas had managed to destroy this very important part of the Star Wars saga, and he had actually managed to do this in many ways. The film was filled with funny little robots and cute children. Of course Anakin Skywalker (who eventually was to become Darth Vader) had to be a child in this episode, but did he have to be so adorable? After all, everybody who has seen Star Wars knows he is about to be one of the most dreaded persons of the galaxy. The death-blow, however, was that horrible Jar-Jar-person who did nothing but talk funny, flap his tongue and ears, get into trouble and stumble over things, everything to make the audience laugh. He was not even especially important for the rest of the film.

Of course Star Wars is an adventure for the whole family and some funny and cute things like Jar-Jar and the ewoks are unavoidable, but it feels like Mr Lucas is taking the easy way by concentrating more on special effects than on the story itself. It would be so exciting to se the background, and eventually the end, of the adventure without having to stand all these cute but completely insignificant and annoying things. All this could be avoided if Mr Lucas could only control himself from using the knowledge about computer animation in absurdum.

Conclusion
The background of episodes 4, 5 and 6, and the things that happened after them, are of course of great interest for everyone who has followed the Star Wars saga. But the question is if we are willing to find this out at the cost of the whole saga being turned into a mediocre science fiction story suited primarily for children?

The Star Wars saga is a beautiful and innocent tale about good and evil, and I do not think that we need all these furry animals and cute little details to realize that. If Mr Lucas continues in the same way, he is in the risk of ruining the whole saga, and I really think it is time for him to consider retirement for both himself and the Star Wars adventure.",0
142,1061.a2.txt,"To haze or not to haze, that is a question.","There are many opinions about hazing, at least in Sweden. Some people think that it is the most stupid idea while others think that it is among the best things that ever happened to them. Then we have all other opinions between these two, but it seems as though many of us have something to say in this matter. I will tell you a little about my experiences and I will try to convince you that it is a good idea to have hazing for new students at the university and what I base my opinion upon.

First I will try to define the word hazing. In Sweden it is the games and ceremonies that the first year students are being put through by older students. The hazing is very different from one university to another and from one education program to another but often it has some general parts: the new students get some kind of task that should be solved together, and they are supposed to show the older students respect. In many cases the new students have to wear something particular so that you can distinguish them from other people. The seriousness of the hazing can differ a lot, in some places it is well organised and lasts for two weeks and in other it is only a day. 

Now you can ask yourself: What is the meaning of all this? The purpose is that the new students should get to know each other and not, as you may think, that the older students should get a good laugh. When you get missions to complete you will have to co-operate and then you automatically get to know the rest of the group. You play games and you compete with other groups, witch gives your group a feeling of solidarity. If there are older students who pretend to be mean this feeling can grow even stronger. This way, students are more or less forced together but the result is that you make new friends very quickly and I would say that it works very well.

However, there are people who do not agree with me. Hazing sometimes has bad reputation. A common belief is that it is only humiliating, that there are cruel older students who do everything in their power to make life miserable for the new ones, only to show their own strength. Perhaps the hazing was that way before, and it might still be like that in a few places, but I think that nowadays it is mainly a period when you have fun and get to know a lot of people. I would almost dear to say that many of the ones who are sceptical or critical have never been part of a hazing themselves. They have only heard rumours about it. Then of coarse, hazing does not suit everybody. There are always people who do not like to play or to do things in a group, but normally you can chose to be a less active participant or not to participate at all.

Finally I would like to take myself as an example. August 1996 I moved from Karlstad to Uppsala to begin the Master of Science and Engineering Program. I did not know anyone in Uppsala, at least not that I was aware of, but from the very first day and the following two weeks I did not feel lonely for one minute. The hazing meant activities every day, older students to turn to when you wanted to ask something, a lot of knew friends and many laughs. This term I study English at the A-level and there is no hazing. After three years in Uppsala I know how things work and I already have friends, but I think of the ones that have not. Of coarse I get to know the other students here too, but not as fast. I think that the first month can be terrible if there is no hazing and if you do not have friends outside class from the beginning. 

In conclusion, I would like to say that I think that organised, serious hazing has a meaningful purpose: to make new students feel welcome and not lonely. If the hazing is not working or if there are complaints you should not forbid it, you should improve it. There should be no such thing as people being forced to do things they do not want to do, nor people being humiliated. There are so many good things you can do instead if you use your imagination. Naturally the forms, activities and number of days will have to be different but I think every group of students could find its own way of making the hazing a good experience for everyone.",0
143,1062.a2.txt,Is the individual freedom in danger?,"There is something rotten in the land of education and respect. Almost everyday we read about violence and disrespect in the school. It isn't the children's fault though (not the teacher's fault for that matter). Behind the children's behavior are socio-economic factors, their behavior is only a symptom. But is there anything practical we can do today, to move towards a peaceful classroom? I'm going to argue in this essay that introducing the school uniform can be a good idea. I want to make clear though that introducing school uniforms isn't the one and only solution. School uniforms is one small, positive step. I would like to raise teacher's salary and involve parents even more, but that's a different story. I'm going to argue for school uniforms for pupils up to the twelfth grade.

The most common argument against school uniforms is that it doesn't allow pupils to develop their personality. I don't believe so, because human beings can express themselves in other ways than through clothes. I want to promote a very underestimated channel of expression - the verbal one. Today's society is too obsessed about appearance and the way we look. It is treated as if it was the most important thing many times. I think it would be great if the school could help children focus on what's important - who they are INSIDE and the whole point with school; education, not what they wear. One other thing that seems to be forgotten about is the fact that schooldays DO END (even if it doesn't appear so sometimes). We are only talking about a couple of hours five days a week. On their free time, holidays, weekends and so on, children can wear whatever they like and develop their own style in clothes. What harm can a few hours do? Is it really that big of a deal? Does it mess up the child's personality? I don't think so and I think it is quit absurd to claim that.

What do we gain?

The best thing about the school uniform is that it erase all class differences. You can't tell the rich from the poor. The fashion industry is getting tougher and they are aiming at younger and younger children. Is a seven-year-old expressing his/hers personality through Nike-shoes? Or is it the parents personality? Or the fashion industry's? Children are becoming more and more aware about what's hip and what's not. The poor parents are not gonna be able to buy their children the brand-clothing that's ""in"" right now. Class differences are clear today. What we can gain with the school uniform, except from the erasing of class differences, is a sense of belonging, gemenskap. School colors and their own symbol, ""We in this school"". School uniforms are also a dividing line between home and school. The classroom today looks a lot like a playhouse. I think that school uniforms signals that ""now it is a little bit more serious"". It signals work, in the adult world we have our jobs own ""uniforms""; policemen, politicians, mechanics, basically every workplace has one. Why shouldn't the school have one? I personally think that a uniform would bring some order to the classroom and maybe even respect. My final argument is that the school uniform makes the teacher to take a closer look at his/her pupils. The teacher is a human being and human beings tend to judge before they take a look inside (if they bother to look further). I personally experienced that teachers assumed that I was a bad kid because I liked to dress in black at an early age. I wore heavy metal-t-shirts and was immediately assumed to be a troublemaker. Even if I didn't do anything that idea seemed to tag along. Everything is not in your clothes, but it is easy to judge anyway. With school uniforms the teacher would treat the individual pupil after a better criteria.

Final comment

I think that the school uniform deserves a better name than the one it has today. People seems to think of the army or snobbish, English public schools when you start to talk about it. I don't see it as a status object, it makes the classroom more equal and fair to the pupils! It does not pose a threat to the personality of the pupil and it helps the pupils to focus on what is important - their future.",0
144,1064.a2.txt,Admission to the Psychologist-program-The Importance of Suitable Psychologists,"Psychologists have a very important function in our society. They support people in grief, help teenagers with their love-problems and do their best to cure patients with various psychological disorders. To become a psychologist you have to study for five years at the University and you have to have top-grades to get accepted to the Psychologist-program. This means that most Psychologists probably are quite intelligent, but it does not necessarily mean that they are the most suitable persons for this job. Instead the Universities should adopt a different admission system, admitting people on basis of their grades combined with an interview element. 

Psychologists spend most their working time meeting and talking to people. The persons they talk to are presumably depressed, sad, unhappy, desperate or perhaps even suicidal. In these situations the Psychologist has to carry a great deal of responsibility, as it in fact might be a question of life or death. It is of absolute importance that the Psychologist is sensitive to the needs of the persons and also that he/she is able to approach them in a suitable way. An arrogant or careless person is therefore most unfitted for this proffession. The importance of the character and personality of the psychologist can't be stressed enough. Of course he or she has to have some academic abilities to be able to learn different methods and approaches to identify and treat different kinds of psychological disorders. However, it doesn't matter how well they know these things if they can't approach the person in need for help, in an appropriate way. This fact is not taken into any consideration by the admission system of today. The Universities simply admit people just looking at their grades without knowing anything about the person in question or about the qualities this person possess. He or she might even be a psycho-path for all they know. This is perhaps going to the extremes, but in reality this can actually happen. 

 Intelligence and good grades are of course not a disadvantage for a psychologist. In contrast, they can absolutely be an advantage as in most professions. The thing about adding the interview element is that you take both the grades and the personality into consideration. So the persons getting admitted would probably still have very good grades as well as they would be more motivated and more suitable. The University can still have a cut-off limit, saying that you have to have a certain average to get the opportunity to qualify for the interview. This means that the persons accepted will be able to handle the long and quite demanding education.

Looking at all these advantages you might wonder why the presented admission system isn't used (although some actually do use it, like the University of Link√∂ping for example). There is of course a reason for this and this reason is as always money... It is more expensive to adopt this kind of admission system, there is no doubt about that. However, it is rather short-sighted to think that way. Not only would we get more suitable psychologists by adding the interview element, but it would also result in more motivated students. This would in return mean that less people would drop-out from the education. Since it is such an expensive education the University loses a lot of money, if the students just drop-out. So this would actually mean that the Universities could gain some money by adopting this system. Not to mention how unfair it is for the more motivated and eager students, who could have entered instead of the ones dropping out. 

To sum up, using this admission system combining both the students' grades and results on the interview, would provide the society with better and more suitable psychologists. This is something our whole society should be interested in. This does not mean that unintelligent persons get accepted, since the grades still are considered. Of course it would be more expensive using this method, but that is looking short-sighted at the issue. Not only would society gain on it in the long run, but drop-outs would be less and thereby some money is actually gained.",0
145,1065.a2.txt,Who Should Look After Grandma?,"Two years ago, I worked extra in an old people's home. The place filled me with anxiety. The pensioners spent most of their time in their rooms, sleeping or reading (those who still had an eyesight good enough). Some sat looking out the window for hours. I caught myself hoping I would never be so old that society would have to take care of me. And when it came to my parents, I would of course take care of them myself. They could look after my children when they got home from school, tell them stories and play with them. It would be just like in the good old days, when the family took care of the elderly, without intervention or help from society. Thinking about it now, however, I realize that the issue if far more complex than what I thought back then. In the society of today, taking care of your elderly yourself would be very difficult, if not impossible.
First, I would like to reveal some of the myths about the ""good old days"". We tend to think that the elderly always have had a high status in the past. They enjoyed great respect, and their wisdom was widely known. However, this was not necessarily the case. In almost all societies, old people have had a low status. Of course, not very many people turned that old in those days, but those who did could expect having to struggle hard for their bread and butter. In some mountain districts of Japan, it was common that the elderly drew back up in the mountains to die when they felt that they were getting weak. If they did so by their own free will is questioned by anthropologists. Presumably they were subject to strong social pressure. In other cultures where resources were limited, the elderly might even be killed when they became a burden to society. Turning to our own country, old people have not been treated much better. Those who came from relatively wealthy circumstances were usually put in the ""exception cottage"" while the oldest son (usually) took over the main house. If you did not have any children, or if they were incapable of taking care of you, you could look forward to being sold at an auction as a pauper. Another option was to walk from farm to farm and do as much work as you were capable of in exchange for food and shelter. 
Still, there were of course cases in which the family looked after their elderly in a way that worked well for both parties. Why could this not be possible today? Well, there are two main reasons. First, the aging process is not the same today as it was then. Today, medicines cure infections that were terminal a hundred years ago. People live longer for each generation, but the number of years they manage on their own has not increased very much. Taking care of an Alzheimer patient is a full-time job today. It is admirable that senile persons were taken care of within the family a hundred years ago, but one has to bear in mind that the sufferer did probably not survive for as many years then as he/she may now. Nutrition might be poor, and cuts and wounds the person got as a result from the disease often led to terminal infections. 
The second reason, which is perhaps more important, is that society has changed. In the old peasant community, people worked on the farm or at least not very far from it. The families gathered at meals, and the women worked at home most of the time. Thus, there was someone around who could have an eye to the elderly every now and then. This is rarely the case today. There would not be much use of having your elderly parents living with you if you were not there to mind them. In order to be able to take care of our elderly at home, we would have to adapt to a different standard of living. Let us say that the average Swede needs some kind of help when he/she reaches the age of 70. The children are then probably around 40-45, that is, they are at the top of their career. They would have to quit their jobs or start working part time to be able to look after their parents. Presumably, this would be the woman's duty in most families, which would be setback for equality. It would also lead to a reduced income for the family. Even with the parents' pensions included, it would be difficult financially to move to a larger apartment. Thus, most families would have to adjust to living in overcrowded conditions. Moreover, families are spread all over the country, or even the world, today. Many elderly would probably oppose having to move to a new city and leave their well-known surroundings. 
To me it is obvious that the state, not the family should look after the elderly. It might not be the ultimate solution, but it is probably the only possible one in this society. If we want to take care of our elderly ourselves, we have to start by making a thorough change of society as a whole. And what would that change look like? Going back to the peasant community if the 19th century is probably not a good alternative. I think state-funded facilities for eldercare are necessary in the society of today. To me, the question is not whether they should exist or not - what we need to discuss is how to improve them. The system we have today may very well be invalid, but to simply put the responsibility on the families will not do much help.",0
146,1067.a2.txt,GENETICALLY ENGINEERED FOODS: RISK TO HUMANITY,"Giant transnational companies are carrying out a dangerous global experiment by introducing large numbers of genetically engineered foods into our diet. Genetic manipulations can result in unanticipated harmful effects, and because genetically engineered foods are not tested sufficiently, this experiment not only jeopardizes the health of individuals, but could also lead to global food shortages and extensive ecological hazards.
Due to genetically modified food's unique and unknown nature, there is potential for adverse health side effects. It is impossible to predict the impact of genetic food, it is a matter of waiting for and observing future consequences. The cross-species transfers being made, such as between fish and tomatoes, would not happen in nature and may create new toxins, diseases, and weaknesses. An example of a possible health detrimental effect is resistance to widely used antibiotics.
A new type of maize is currently being produced in the UK. Maize is attacked by the corn borer mite, that chews through the stalks. Genetically modified maize has been produced to be repellent to the mite. The marker gene in the new maize is resistant to ampicllin, an antibiotic. Scientists are concerned that when this maize is eaten, the gene will come in contact and be passed to bacteria living in the human gut. These bacteria would then be resistant to the antibiotic. There is only a slight chance of this occurring, but there is always a first time.
Transferring animal genes into plants also raises important ethical issues for vegetarians and religious groups. It may also involve animal experiments that are unacceptable to many people. Once a genetically modified organism has been released into the environment it can reproduce, move and even mutate. After its release, it cannot be recalled. Unlike chemical or nuclear contamination, genetic pollution is perpetual. It can never be reversed or cleaned up; genetic mistakes will be passed on to all future generations of a species. The huge areas of genetically identical crops will influence the evolution of local pests, plants, wildlife, and disrupt surrounding ecosystems. There is no way of stopping genetically engineered plants from breeding with wild plants and contaminating them with foreign DNA strains. Pollen from genetically engineered crops can be transferred to cultivated and wild plants up to a mile away. What would happen if the genes for insect and weed killer resistance, that have been introduced to crop plants, found their way into weeds? The result could be 'super weeds' which would force the development of more toxic herbicides.
Traditionally, farmers around the world would save some of their harvest to use as next year's seed. This practice would be prevented with genetically engineered crops under the terms of a license. There is also a possibility of companies selling sterile seeds. The companies developing genetically modified plants and animals wish to legally own these new life forms in order to protect their investments.
Supporters of genetic engineering say the gene splicing process is accurate and precise. In fact, the process of inserting genes is quite fortuitous and can damage normal genes. Many weaknesses in plants, animals, and humans have their foundations in minute flaws in the genetic code. Consequently, the random damage resulting from gene insertion will inevitably result in irreversible damage.
Genetically modified food activists promise gene technology will supply plentiful amounts of food to starvation stricken areas in the Third World. Genetic engineering is profit driven rather than science driven. Biotechnology research serves the desires of the rich rather than the needs of the poor. Biotechnology is primarily a commercial activity that determines what is investigated, how it is applied and who are to benefit. Biotechnology will concentrate power into the hands of a select few, which in turn will enhance farmers' dependence and force them to pay inflated prices for seed-chemical packages.
Genetic engineering poses the greatest danger of any technology yet introduced. The damaging effects of genetic engineering are irreversible, but we have the capability to prevent a catastrophe before it occurs. We must take precautionary action if we are to protect ourselves, and all generations to come. We must refuse genetically modified food immediately, if we want to prevent an avalanche of deviant foods from permeating the market and placing the world at risk.",0
147,1068.a2.txt,The Union: friend and foe,"Fifty years ago the European Union was formed to prevent future wars in Europe and ensure the safety of democray. Today it is a bureaucratic labyrinth. It's powerstructure is known for it's secrecy and the European people are at best sceptic and at worst uninterested. How are we supposed to make things better if no takes an interest? This paper deals with is the Swedish people's uninterest towards thr lack of EU democracy. 
The first basic principle of Swedish democracy is that all power originates from the people. When Sweden joined EU there was a general feeling that we had given up on democracy as we know it. The main worry, as I see it, was that of actual power. The highest authorities in EU are The Ministry council and The Commision. These are not electoral bodies. They remain the same, uneffected, by elections to the EU parliament. You can not dismiss the Ministry council even if they've done something wrong.

 Each country can, by general elections, dismiss a single member of the Council. But the body as a whole is uneffected. This obvious anti-democratic way of organizing the European Uninon is problematic.The main thing is that the responsibility does not lie with the actual power.We, as individulas, are not allowed to view documents from the Council's or the Commision's proceeding nor can we hold them responsible for their actions. The only electoral body in EU is the Parliament, here delegates are chosen by general elections in each country. The parliament is, however, not a decision making body and can sometimes seem inconsequential. What I am concerned with is that people don't seem to care. People must be made aware that change is always possible. But it must be initiated, it does not happen by itself.

Is there then, no way for the people react to decisions made by these high authorities? Fortunately, there is. First we have the most drastical one. If a majority of registered voters in Sweden feel that the Council's or Commison's decisions are not in agreement with their own ideals then it is their right to vote for a swedish withdrawal from the European Union. This kind of extreme measure is, of course, a last resort but it should be kept in mind. The next is one of internal investigation. In this case there is even a historical precedent. The Commision before the present was subject to an investigation of that kind. Due to some rumors, concerning corruption in the Commision, the EU Parliament initiated an investigation. On the basis of that investigation the Commision resigned. It could not be dismissed by Parliment but the political confidence for the Commision was so hurt that it became impossible to go on like before. This shows that there are still ways to reform the power structure. To point out these things is to make the people aware. 

One of the exciting things about EU is that it holds a tremendous opportuninty to renew ourselves as democratic fighters. Sweden's principle of public access to official records has for a very long time have, for a long time, been taken for granted. The result has been that almost no one takes adavantage of it. Now things have changed. We can't investigate EU that easy, so we have to become more active. I do not refer directly to the public but rather to professionals like journalists and reporter. There is, however, a need for an increased general interest in EU matters.We have to become aware that the present structure of the European Union is not an unchangeable one. 

Summing up I find that the European Union has a power structure that to us Swedes, and many other Europeans, seem undemocratic. But to change this we have become more active as citizens.There is today a predominant uninterest towards the Union and that uninterest is on of the greatest threats to our future society. We have to be aware of the possibilities of reform that are open. Furthermore that we have a new chance to fight for democracy. In this fight we might realize that democracy is not a given thing and also to re-establish the reason to why this Union was formed: To stop wars and ensure democracy. The Union remains a friend to have and a foe to fight.",0
148,1069.a2.txt,HOUSE OF KICKS: THE UNDERGROUND'S ENEMY #1.,"In recent times, the last two or three years, traditional back-to-basic hard rock has caught the attention of Swedish mainstream media. The figure-heads of this ""revival of rock""-trend is unarguably the Swedish bands The Hellacopters and Backyard Babies, together with Norwegians Gluecifer.
This essay is about why these bands have managed to make a name for themselves and why, sadly enough, it's not likely that any new Swedish bands will challenge them at the top. 
To be able to fully understand my arguments, some background information about the rock-underground in Sweden is necessary. Now, the only nationwide distributor of small independent record-labels dealing with metal/punk/hard rock, Swedish labels as well as foreign ones, is House Of Kicks. This almost monopoly situation puts them in the position where they alone can decide which labels' or bands' records they want record-shops to have in their assortment. They have the same power when it comes to promotion towards the media. The people in charge of the music/entertainment-sections in national or local press have, in general, little or no knowledge about the underground-scene, especially when it comes to ""extreme music"", and they tend to rely on House Of Kicks' recommendations. In addition to this, House Of Kicks also put out their own records under various label-names. Needless to say, they of course promote these records harder on the expence of other labels they have agreed to distribute and promote. Having explained House Of Kicks' dominant position in these fields we can go on discussing the topics I mentioned in my introduction. 
So, if the music-press do not always have the interest for new and exciting bands, they certainly always have interest for another aspect of the music-industry; new and exciting trends. Well aware of this, and their position in Swedish music-industry, House Of Kicks decided to pull off a daring promotion-stunt in 1996. They invented a new label called White Jazz, dedicated to ""true action-packed rock 'n' roll"" (actual quote), and as their first signing they chosed Stockholm's The Hellacopters. This was of course no coincidence, as The Hellacopters had already made a name for themselves in the underground through a couple of self-financed EP's. However, more important was the fact that the band was the brainchild of Nicke Andersson, who was already well-known to the mainstream audience for his work with the metal-band Entombed. White Jazz (i.e. House Of Kicks) promoted The Hellacopters as ""Sweden's only real rock 'n' roll-band"", a slogan that trend-seeking music-journalists on national, Stockholm-based, newspapers found irresistible. Therefore, The Hellacopters began to recieve huge attention from these people, who of course started to act like they had always liked this kind of music, although they had never before mentioned similar bands in their columns... Anyway, these born-again rockers now praised Rock 'n' Roll in their influential, not to mention hip, Friday entertainment supplements to the regular newspapers. This made the ball roll, the mainstream audience began to look for Hellacopters-records in their local stores and the hip Stockholm-critics suddenly started to mention long forgotten bands of yesterday as their all-time favourites (yet again, no-one had mentioned them before...). Rock was alive again! 
Meanwhile, in the not so glamorous world of underground-rock, other bands playing similar music saw their chance to rise to stardom, since everybody in the music-business apparently loved their kind of music, many of these bands already had recordcontracts so what could possibly go wrong? Well, for some reason these bands' records simply didn't got any attention from the distributor, House Of Kicks. Consequentely, they recieved no back-up from media and for the audience in general they remained in obscurity.
In fact, the only other ""Hellacopters-style""-bands that have made an inpact on the market is the above mentioned Backyard Babies, mainly due to the fact that their charismatic guitarist Dregen also played in The Hellacopters, and Gluecifer, which eventually also is signed to White Jazz. 
In conclusion, Sweden have a lot of talented hard rock-bands and many of them should appeal to fans of The Hellacopters and the like, given a chance. However, due to House Of Kicks' corrupt money-making policies and the laziness and shallowness of the coat-turninging music-journalists in general, the majority of the record-buying public is kept in the dark. The fact that House Of Kicks claim to be part of the underground-movement is merely an insult to the genuine underground's motto of ""co-operation, not competition"", or to paraphrase The Rolling Stones: ""It's only rock 'n' roll, and I don't like it"".",0
149,1070.a2.txt,Why we need marks in school.,"Some politicians in Sweden today advocates a school system where there are no marks. Some think that the universities should have special test when they admit the students. Others recommend that the universities should use interviews, or maybe a combination of both systems. I think that we need to keep a system with marks, because it gives the best overall picture of a person's qualities.
I have heard some people say that the marking system is unfair to some students, ""it doesn't show their it doesn't show their social skills, which is the most important quality for a successful work life, a more specialised test or a interview would show that in a better way"". I think that what marks show though is the ability of the student to do well in their time at university, and later on in working life. A test or a interview doesn't show if a person is good at doing their assignments in time, which is a essential quality at university and in working life. If you're not good at that you will not get very good marks from upper secondary school either. If you apply to many different courses and programs at universities you would also have to many tests and interviews, I myself would have had do about fifteen test and interviews. And that is not the way I want to spend my holidays. 
If the marking system is unfair to some students the system with tests and interviews is unfair to other students. The marking system might be unfair to gifted but slack students, who could just take it easy during their time in primary and upper secondary school and then study to the test and hopefully do well. While the interview and test system would be unfair to students who study hard and do well in primary and upper secondary school. That would probably give them good marks, but it doesn't necessarily mean that they would do well in a admission test. The admission test would have to be a summary of what you have learned in your first twelve years in school in that particular subject or those subjects. So if you are a person who learns quickly you could just study hard for a while before the test and probably do well. This system would give these students a wrong impression how life works. When they start at university they will suddenly have to put a fair bit of hard work in their studies and they will have to start to hand in their assignments in time. Since they are not used to that they will probably have a hard time at acclimate to the university life and might even drop out. 
I, myself, have seen some bad sides of a ""marking free"" school system. In New South Wales, Australia, they basically have a marking free school. They do have marks, already from year one, but when you apply for university they are not taken in to account. In the end of year twelve you have chosen to take between four and six subjects and then you take a test in those subjects. This test is called the H.S.C., Higher School Certificate, it is marked between zero and one-hundred, depending on how well you do in comparison with the rest of the state. The person with the best result in the state will get one-hundred and the person with the lowest score will get zero. Some people who have basically straight A's, after putting a lot of hard work in their school work for twelve years, can still get a pretty low H.S.C. score and might not make it to university, even though they would probably do pretty well at university. While a person who just passes his twelve years of school and then study hard for the H.S.C. might get a high result and then make it to university, just to drop out later because he/she can not handle the hard work he/she has to put to his/her university studies.
A school system where there are no marking would favour some people and disfavour others. But I think that it would give the wrong picture of how things work in life. Students need to have some benefits for putting in hard work during their time in school, because that is how it works in life after your first twelve years in school, if they don't they will have big problems when they start at university or enter the working life.",0
150,1072.a2.txt,"Can a democracy, claiming to accept the Human Rights, legally execute its citizens?","I had quite a few questions in my head to answer when I started thinking about the difficult and contradictive issue of capital punishment. What I want to show with my contribution to the debate below is that the death penalty is out of date, and can not in any way fit in within the frames of a democracy.

Capital Punishment has existed for ages. Its purpose is partly to act as a deterrent, to prevent people from committing crimes. But also to annihilate any possibility for the convicted person to commit other crimes. Statistics made in Sweden 1966-1983 on relapse of murder and man-slaughter were 2%. The statistics shows that if capital punishment would have existed in Sweden and all executions would have been carried out, only 2% of all murders would have been prevented, and the number of people sentenced to death would have been in extreme disproportion.
In addition to this, the capital punishment is a very cruel punishment. The methods that are used today are for example the electric chair, hanging, gas poisoning and poison-injection. They are not at all human, and mostly the sentenced prisoner suffers from inhuman pain. In many cases the punishment is nothing but torture.
Anyhow, the capital punishment exists in 94 countries today, 39 of them executed the penalty in 1996. Since the death penalty conflicts with human and political rights, more than 50% of all countries have abolished it.
The US has always pretended to be an important pleader for human rights and individual freedom. I believe however that there are many things to be said in contradiction to that. One issue that does not at all correspond to any democratic idea is the Capital Punishment. The US has (mostly due to Republican majority in the senate and House of Representative) omit ratifications of several treatys on Human Rights, and has made reservations on many of them. The Republicans are in general not in favour of international conventions on human rights. Reservations that have been made are some of the most central parts of the convention, like for example the prohibition of death penalty on underaged.
The US is for instance one of eight contries in the world having executed underaged during the last years. That fact makes the US a doubtful and contradictive democracy. The capital punishment also raises one of Americas most difficult questions; racism. 84% of all executions after 1977 were on murder on whites, despite the fact that the total number of victims of murder is equally divided between whites and blacks. One can conclude that execution is applied in an unfair and most discriminating way. It is odd that the US does not seem to be more anxious for protecting its international reputation as a democratic country.
Also history shows discrimination of minority groups. Even if tyranny of native Americans and slavery have been over for a long time now, there is still a white majority with sets of values that permeate the hole society. 
Extreme success for the rights of minorities was gained with the Civil Rights movement, commenced in the fifties, and on the surface it may appear as the American system is working satisfactory. Yet, the capital punishment shows the contrary.
So does the overall opinion; most Americans are in favour of the punishment.
 I, myself believe that this is due to ignorance. Candidates running for presidency show through their attitude towards the death penalty that they are ""tough on crime"", and history speaks its own language; the people of America seem to vote for the maintenance of the punishment, but against other possible solutions to decrease crime and violence.
In addition, the capital punishment is a waste of resources. People that have been sentenced to death are very expensive since they spend many years in jail before being executed. The process is long and costly.
But still, executions are carried out. Mostly in the Southern States where as much as 90% of all death-sentences are executed. In these areas the slavery was widespread, and racism is still tangible. Individualist traditions can also explain the American attitude towards capital punishment. Meaning that all idividuals are given a chance to succeed in life and that you can only blame yourself if you don't.
In contrast stand over 50% of the world, the awareness of the cruelty of the punishment, its racial partiality and the uselessness of it, since it serves only to show that the only remedy of violence is violence and that it is carried out by the authority. The death penalty sends signals that say it is alright to murder each other. One can ask if that is a good way to decrease violence, and since it is an expensive process, the money could be placed in other preventive ways.
In conclusion, I believe that capital punishment is a waste of money and human resources, it is a stupid way to decrese crime since it is a measure taken too late. If the resources spent on the executing process were invested to improve education and social care the crimes would decline in number and the individual freedom and security will increase.",0
151,1074.a2.txt,Unemployment-Solutions to the problem,"Introduction
The middle-aged and older people in Sweden were brought up in a time with a strong social network and a low unemployment. Historically people have considered the government to be responsible for people that are unemployed. Today this picture is changing. Older people still blame the government for them being unemployed, while the younger generation takes more responsibility for their unemployment. They do not blame the society to the same extent, and put in a bigger effort to improve their situation. In this essay I will discuss arguments concerning whether or not one can, or should, blame the government for people being unemployed and what can be done to decrease the level of unemployment in Sweden.

Unemployment
Many people that are unemployed do not put a lot of effort in trying to improve their situation. They think, that by paying taxes and being a member of a union, they will be taken care of in case they become unemployed. Unfortunately for them, this is not how it works. Of course they should receive help from the government and their union in finding a new job as well as getting financial support from their unemployment benefit fund. This is everybody's right. The problem is that a lot of people that have been unemployed for a long time have given up. They are convinced that they will never have a proper job again, and therefore they do not make an effort to find a new job. This is a dangerous effect of unemployment, people have given up and continue to live on welfare and the unemployment funds.

In Kiruna, a proposal was submitted by the local authorities, stating that people that are unemployed will not receive further support unless they put themselves at disposal for various unemployment programs such as further education or a trainee post. This program is designed to force people that have given up to activate themselves if they want further support from the state. There is, as always, both a good and a bad side to this kind of programs. Can we really motivate an unemployed doctor to take a job selling hamburgers or cleaning houses? Not that there is anything wrong with these jobs, but understandably he or she will not find it very stimulating. On the other hand, this program might stimulate people to get an education or start their own business.

A lot of middle-aged Swedes are also brought up in a time where grants from the society have been very common. This has made them very spoiled, and their household economy has been based on, and is dependent on, these grants. If they for some reason become unemployed, they expect that the government will se to that they do not have to lower their living standards or sell their new car. This attitude has to change. The Swedish government has been far too generous in issuing grants for all kinds of purposes. Grants should only be given to people in real need of them, not to people who want to buy a new car or move into a bigger apartment.

Another aspect of unemployment is a very current one; factory shutdowns. Very often, the company that shuts down a factory is being considered as an inhumane and horrible employer, who does not care the least about its' employees. But is unemployment really a company's responsibility? I think not! Of course companies carry a great deal of responsibility for their personnel and should try to find good solutions and alternative jobs in case of a factory shutdown. But in the long run, the companies biggest responsibility, is to be as profitable and efficient as possible in order to secure jobs for the future and increase wealth of the country.

How can we then create new job opportunities in Sweden? A lot of politicians claim that people starting their own businesses will create the most jobs. On the other hand, business people all over Sweden, mean that for this to happen the corporate climate of Sweden has to improve. Most important of all is that it has to be cheaper to employ workers. Today smaller companies have a hard time expanding, since it is so expensive to hire people because of the high taxation rates on labour. First after this tax has been significantly reduced, and the corporate climate is more appealing, the desired effect on employment can be experienced.

Conclusion
Unemployment in Sweden is going down, from around ten percent in the early 90's it is now down to around five percent. There is however still a lot of work to be done regarding unemployment problems. The biggest problems are that people are not willing to take responsibility for their unemployment and that people that have been unemployed for a long time are loosing their hopes about ever finding a job again. Sweden also need a better corporate climate, taxation on labour is too high for small businesses that want to expand. We also need to use government funds more wisely, grants are being given to people who are not really in need of them. Instead, people who are in real need of grants should be able to receive more.",0
152,1077.a2.txt,Monarchy is Feudalistic,"Most people remain totally indifferent when the question of the Royal family's being or not being is discussed. The total indifference, clearly proves the unimportance of having a king in Sweden today. The monarchy in Sweden is ancient and doesn't fit in a democratic society. We must question the value of our king. The head of State has lost his power and our strongest symbol ought to have been elected to be able to represent our democracy. The king hasn't been elected by the people and his only true function is to hold on to our old traditions and to represent Sweden abroad. We have politicians that could do a much better work themselves when it comes to representations. Politicians haven't inherited their position which makes them a lot more trustworthy when representing Sweden. Times have changed and so have the positions of the ones with the best qualities to rule Sweden. 
 When the Swedish king lost his power some decades ago he lost his value as a king. It's no use having a powerless head of state. The fact that the monarch hasn't been elected seems even more inappropriate in a democratic country where all in authority should be fully able to represent the people. King Karl XIV Gustaf may seem like a king of our time, but still his position is a creation of the past. The monarch's possibilities as a head of state are very smallish and the head of state should, according to the rules of democracy be elected by the people. The monarchy belongs to an ancient period in time when feudal society was the only existing way of ruling a country. 
 Although one might suggest that the Swedish king of today, Karl XVI Gustaf, doesn't cause any harm according to the fact that he has no actual political power I refer to the fact that he still symbolises a non - democratic country. Sweden has had tyrannical kings and rivalry within the Royal House has been common throughout history. Referring back to King Erik XIV, who was deceived and killed by his brother Johan because he was the eldest and therefore the king. This is an example of what criminal acts monarchs were dealing with in the 15th century. Power was worth killing for then, but things have changed and today such acts would remove the king from his position. But still the king isn't as easily removed as a politician, which is particularly strange. The king who has inherited his position can hold on to it until his death. An elected politician is however generally easily put away from the position. The king has to make great mistakes before being removed due to the fact that his position has been inherited, not reached in an intellectual way. This symbolizes a double moral in a social democratic country where everyone should be equal. 
 In an equal society everyone should be able to vote in elections. But our king is always neutral. The king is an inhabitant in a democratic country but isn't able to vote himself. Democracy means power of the people and since everyone is said to be equal the king should also be able to vote. But if he does he can no longer remain our king. Democracy is our most important ground to stand on, therefore the king should preferably lose his position. 
 If the king vanishes, would that jeopardise Swedish economic interests abroad. One must remember that our king is an excellent promoter of Swedish export. But I consider it to be only a drop in the ocean. The role of the politicians is considerably more important today than the king's. The Swedish increasing collaboration within the EU strengthens our international contacts and is a well - working representation for Sweden abroad. There is no longer any use for a king in Sweden and holding on to traditions is not a sufficient reason for keeping the Royal House. 
 The monarchs were apparently of great importance once, but the situation of today demonstrates that monarchs in Sweden have no significance but to represent our country during different ceremonies abroad and appearing on special occasions in Sweden. That duty could quite easily be done by any politician who has been elected in a democratic way.",0
153,1078.a2.txt,Democrasy-it is in your hands,"Democracy is a wonderful thing we have in our country and it's not something you can take for granted. The number of participators in our elections at present are getting fewer and fewer and I wonder why?
Many people maybe feel that they can't be of any influence in the society today, I don't agree with that. If you want something to be different you must make an effort in trying to change it. 
In our parliament today the Social Democrats has the majority and our country is runned towards the left, but every fourth year we have an election that makes it possible to change that. It's our responsibility to take a stand and then vote for the party that suits us the best. Democracy is not about a couple of hundred of persons making laws and deciding what's best for the country in their own point of view. They are there for your sake and it's you who placed them there.
It has happened that a couple of our politicians have broken the law or behaved unethical which makes many of us loose faith in them. Remember that they are normal people just like any of us, it's human to make mistakes and if you feel that you're trust for the government is so low that it makes you don't want to vote for any of the parties then just vote blank that is the best way to show your disappointment. Otherwise there will never be any changes to the better. 
Sometimes I hear people say that it takes too much of their spare time to be familiar with everything that are being discussed in the government, but there is a midway through this. If you read your morningpaper there is enough information to get you posted. So don't come and say it takes to much of your time when you can easily be informed while eating your breakfast. When it comes to the day of the election you are maybe out on a trip somewhere but if that is the case you can always vote by post which is an easy and fast way. 
When we became a member of the European Union the ""yes"" side won with just a few more votes but since then I have never heard any positive thing about the EU. If you watch the news or talk to friends the reaction towards the union is everything but positive. I may be wrong about this but if everyone that had the right to vote in the election did that we probably would had said no to a membership. In most cases the ones that doesn't vote is the ones who are dissatisfied with the situation. Everyone new that we were getting closer to a membership and it is to late now to start criticising EU when we're already a part of it. Some say that our country is to little that our influence in the union is the same as slim to nun. It is true that we don't have much to say against the larger countries like Germany or France but if we were not a member would we have more to say then, I don't think so. There are many weak points in the EU now but it will grow stronger and let's hope it will be in a positive direction and we can influence that by choosing our favourite politicians to go down there and fight for our issues to be carried through.
Democracy is our right in Sweden and many of us see it as obvious which is wrong. If you look in our history you can see that we haven't had this fortune for very long and if we're not more careful it's not that far away to go back to a dictatorship. Before any of that will happen I hope you're sensible enough to know that your vote is your voice in our society today. Make yourself heard and take your responsibility now before it's to late. If you don't I assure you that you will regret it.",0
154,1081.a2.txt,STOP THE GRADING IN PHYSICAL-EDUCATION!!,"I have chosen to write my argumentation on a topic that has been very close to me, namely the unfairness of grading students in Physical-Education. It is my opinion that you should discard the grading in Physical-Education as it is today(G VG MVG & IG). I have had the opportunity to discuss this with two different Physical-Education teachers and they were both inclined to agree with me on what I had to say.

In upper secondary school the Physical-Education course is on as much as 130 points(1 point being 1 hour), and therefor it is quite an important course. The intention of the course is to give the student an opportunity to move around and get the blood circulation up and as a result of that the student should feel better and achieve better results in other subjects as well. The course is in fact called SPORTS & HEALTH(Idrott och h√§lsa) where the health part has been all but forgotten. The Physical-Education is in itself not a bad idea, but many students do not take this chance because they feel that they have to show-off in front of their teachers to get good grades. 
Another thing is that many students find the things they do in class boring. Some of the obligatory things that students HAVE to do are; ballgames, track & field sports and high jump, usually a student likes one or some of these sport events but very seldom all. The students are expected to perform well in all of them or their average will fall, resulting in a not so good grade. All these demands on them gives many students performance anxiety. Therefor I have found a good solution - discard the normal grading of Physical-Education!
One of the negative responses from teachers have been: ""We can not discard the grading, the students would simply choose not to show up"". Well for that I have found a solution. You could replace the present grading with an old one, the D meaning 'Deltagit'(P for Participate).it does not grade the students performance only his/her participation. To be able to get your points for the course you would have to show up at lessons, at least 3/4 of the total, properly dressed and participate in one of the activities, if you do not have a valid reason not to.
If you were to discard the normal grading much of the performance anxiety would disappear and more students would probably benefit from Physical-Education, the way they are supposed to. They would find it more fun, being able to do what they think is fun and not having to do all the things the course plan has set up.
Another thing that could be a result is that more unusual things could be introduced into the Physical-Education. Things that today are not on the course plan. For example massage, relaxation gymnastics, Qui Gong/Tai Qui(Chi), aerobics or step-up. That might be things that the students might find more interesting than the usual gymnastics and they would probably benefit more from them too. You can of course not exclude the old-fashioned sports, there are students who find them interesting.
As the grading system is today the students who does not have sports as their spare time hobby have problems in performing as well as they who do. This is not something that many teachers consider when grading their pupils. That results in an unbalance where good grades are given to those who have one or many sports as their spare time hobby. The result of this can be rather the opposite of what the Physical-Education was to be all about, moving and feeling better. I have seen how such a student, with no spare time sport, was harassed by the teacher, because he/she could not perform as well as the rest of the class, and the sad part in this case was that the other students followed the teachers lead and froze this person out. This might not be very common but the fact is that it should not happen at all. By removing the grading of students in Physical-Education the harassment would, in my opinion, disappear because the pressure would lessen.
You would have to keep the grading in the sports programmes in the upper secondary school. They are there to have more sports that normal students and the grading of them would by no means be wrong or unfair, because it is of their own choosing. They could have their own scale of marks that take into account that they are 'professionals to be' because they usually practise their sport during the lessons.

My conclusion is that if you were to discard the grading of the normal upper secondary school Physical-Education and letting it be more free of choice, you would have happier students and happier students are healthier students, more willing to participate in the Physical-Education and there by getting the exercise they need. It will all become a good circle.",0
155,1088.a2.txt,"Mother, Father, Child: Mother, Mother, Child","Sweden is a free, modern country with liberal views. Although homosexuals' rights in Swedish society are improving, their rights are not the same as heterosexuals' rights. Since some years ago, homosexual couples have the right to get married, but they do not have the rights to adoption, consequently this can stop them from bringing up a child. Below I am going to make a comparison between homosexual couples and single parents since they are, in most cases, refused adoption of a child. But more space will be devoted to homosexual couples compared with heterosexual ones, concerning what makes heterosexuals more suitable as parents, and what a heterosexual couple can give a child that a homosexual cannot. In my opinion, homosexual couples should have the same rights as heterosexual ones. Your sexual preference does not determine your appropriateness of bringing up a child. There are a great number of orphans in this world who are in need of a caring and loving guardian; somebody that would love them like they would love a child of their own. People that have seriously considered an adoption are individuals that have step by step gone over the procedure of an adoption. They are willing to struggle for a long period of time, to be ready for the presence of a child. Questions such as: How are they going to plan the adoption and the years to come?, How are they going to face problems?, have been considered. However, some people are refused to adopt a child. Not only because of their financial status or age, but also of the way the have chosen to live their lives. Single parents and homosexual couples do therefore have something in common: They are seen as incapable of raising a child, even if they have considered the questions above and are ready to face future complications. In my opinion, there should be no elimination of single people and homosexual couples as potential parents. Your sexual preference or your civil status does not determine if you are going to be a good parent of not. 
As a child you need somebody to look up to, someone to follow and take after. Most probably, adoption agencies would claim that the adopted child should be able to find these persons within their families; a mother figure and a father figure. This makes homosexual couples inadequate compared to heterosexual couples. In contrast, we have to face the fact that the so called nuclear family structure is changing. Nowadays a great number of families consist of a single parent and his or her children. Consequently, children start looking for models outside their immediate family. A grand parent, a teacher, or a close friend to the family can serve as a perfect model for a child. So after all, a homosexual couple would be just as adequate as a single parent. 
Adopted children often grow up not knowing who their biological parents are and what they are like. In teenage years existential thoughts pop up in every adolescent's head. For his reason, growing up can be extra hard for adopted children. A counter argument for letting homosexual couples adopt could be that adopted children should get a child hood and adolescence as ""normal"" as possible. Therefore, homosexual couples would not meet up to the ""normality"" requested as parents by society. 
But then we have to ask ourselves the question: What kind of ""normality"" is it that a homosexual parent cannot give a child that a heterosexual parent can? Honesty? Support? Security? Love? I would say that these parental qualities do not follow sexual preferences. Since homosexuals do not have the right to adopt I can only refer to a debate program I saw that was broadcasted not that long ago. A man that grew up with two mothers, one of them being his biological mother, the other one his mother's girlfriend, was interviewed. His mother's girlfriend had served as an extra mother that had raised him just as much as his biological mother. He had lived an ordinary childhood. Of course questions had arisen about his family situation, but he had never suffered from not living in a ""normal"" family. Now he is living happily with his future wife. In brief, my opinion is that heterosexuals and homosexuals should have the same rights in society. To raise a child is something many couples want to do. However, homosexual couples are not allowed to. I think Swedish citizens, living in a modern country should consider homosexual couples as potential parents and to let them adopt children.",0
156,1090.a2.txt,Experimenting with and research on animals,"There is something called experimenting with animals, that is testing of substances and researching on medicine and illnesses on animals. There is also research on animals where humans in their craving for knowledge on the function on a certain species do research on it, research that requires that certain individuals be killed. There are two sides to this coin. The suffering of the animals or their loss of dignity, because as seen below the animals need not know what is done to them, and the suffering of humans. As the human society is, obviously, constructed of humans the latter must be the worst for us. I have encountered two different ways/uses for animals in research, the first is experimenting on animals in research on rheumatism.

Most people think experimenting with animals is not acceptable. In their minds they are seeing rabbits suffering while used for testing of cosmetics. I too believe that should be forbidden, but not all experimenting on animals is unnecessary. Research on rheumatism is, I think, necessary. This research is for discovering the reason for rheumatism and through that discovery later finding a cure. At this moment there are only ways of delaying the illness. The research is done on mice at BMC. The mice are infected or treated so that they are going to get rheumatism in the future. When the first signs on the illness shows, but before the mice starts feeling it, they are killed and sliced into parts that are possible to view from under a microscope. Sometimes unfortunately they have to let the mice live longer and in those cases they are probably suffering from the illness. On the other hand humans with rheumatism suffer a lot, it is one of the worst diseases there are, especially when it happens to young people and children. As the suffering of the mice is minimal and the amount of mice used is very restricted, my friend working on this used about 3 mice a day, although this may vary a lot, I believe that this kind of research is highly motivated. Who when really ill would refuse the medicine or even ask if it was researched on animals. There are alternatives to using animals are an argument that is often used. In this case I don't believe that it is possible to research on little clumps of cells as they don't have any joints or on humans, who would that be? Hardly voluntaries. The other type of experiments made on animals that I have encountered was not for research on human illnesses but for another reason.

At the centre for education of veterinarians there is some animals bred and used only for experimenting. Apart from bigger animals, like horses and cows, all animals used for experimenting must also be bred especially for experiments. The most mild use for them is the mares and stallions that are kept for the students to learn of breeding and how to test when a mare is ready for insemination. The worse experiments consist of operations on animals, among other Beagles. 

Before an experimental operation is started the dog is put to sleep and it is never woken again afterwards. Even if the dog would survive the operation the suffering during the recovery is deemed to high. The reason for the operations are the training of the veterinarian students and is essential in their education. The student I talked to has done one operation on a Beagle once, they where eight students operating on one dog and they trained every possible type of operations including those that could be acutely lifesaving, so there are no unnecessary operations done. The Beagles at least have a nice life in a kennel where they may go outside each day and have people to care for them. The veterinary students have met them on some occasions and think that the dogs appear very nice, lively and happy. Nowadays she believed they use only pigs but she is not certain. I am slightly more ambivalent to this kind of experiments but how could they train otherwise? The animals are at least not suffering in any way. It is maybe their dignity or ours, that we use other live beings, that is threatened. On the other hand we breed animals for food and we eat more meat than is necessary for us to survive, just for the taste of it, that must be as bad or slightly worse. 

As long as we have animals as pets and as food I believe we may as well use them for research and experiments that are essential. Who can say that a rabbit suffers more in a cage in a laboratory than in a cage the same size in a seven year olds home. On the other hand as long as the laboratory cannot take care of and give an animal a nice life they should not research on it, monkeys for example that need greater living space and stimulation. But in that case the discussion leads into zoological gardens where animals are kept, and sometimes suffering, only for our amusement. Here I really would like to continue the discussion on to bumblebees, the freezer in the corridor has occasionally harboured some, but I have already written too many words.",0
157,1092.a2.txt,IRC vs. IRL?,"In this essay I will prove that IRC, (Internet Relay Chat) really could improve your social life, that would be social life as in RL, (Real Life). Many people believe that IRC just take up your time without giving anything back. I claim that they are wrong. Soon you will se why.

One argument I quite often get to hear, is that I spend too much time in front of my computers. Especially as I earlier used to meet my friends very often in my spare-time. However, I claim that I still spend very much time with my friends, even more than before. This because I still meet my old friends irl plus that I speak to new and old friends via the irc. So, what are the advantages with irc compared to irl then?
On irc, you can get new contacts/friends that you would not meet if you did not take part of irc, friends with the same interests as you, for example computers. You get to know them well before you actually meet them irl, which means that you always have something to talk about from the very beginning.
By these friends, you can get help with computer related questions, homework etc. They can help you in your daily work, without even having to move away from home.
Another thing that I see as a big plus, should be that you can talk to people about serious things without saying something wrong, this because you have got more time to think about your answers on irc than irl. 
Besides that, you can do several things at the same time when chatting on the net by the same reason as above, you have got more time to think about your answers, it's OK to answer a question after a couple of minutes instead of as irl directly. 
Another great thing about irc, is that you always have someone to talk to, there is always someone awake, ready to listen to your thoughts and so on. 
One major thing that probably passes people that are not interested in this kind of ""relations"" by, is the fact that you develop a new kind of humour. A humour that often can be used only on irc, but sometimes also irl. 
All these facts I've brought up, says that irc develop your rl. Still, that is not the only truth. I know a few people that without irc would not have any social live at all. They believe that irc in fact is rl, those who don't know them that good, believe that irc has had got a bad influence on them, and that they would be more socialised if they did not spend that much time in front of their computers, I say they don't. By this way they at least get contact with people in one way, otherwise they had probably been watching TV instead.
So, are there no negative aspects with irc the? Of course there are. It is easy to get stuck in front of the computer and instead of going to your friends you stay and talk to them on the computer as you don't have to move yourself that way. If the case is so, you will have a decrease in your social life I would say. Still this haven't happen to anyone I know, usually one doesn't stop meeting your rl-friends because you start chatting the net. 

In the conclusion I will tell you about a problem that can occur when your chatting on the net. However I don't know if the problem could be said to emerge because of irc. When friends irl visits you and your' chatting to other friends on the net, the irl-friends often wants you to stop talking to your so called ""invisible friends"", they mean that ""there are no one in front of you, which means that you aren't talking to anyone"". This is rather annoying as I believe that your talking to irc-friends are as much important as talking to people irl. This is why I put the question mark after the topic, it shouldn't be irl vs. irc - they can go together if people understand that both can improve your social life.",0
158,1094.a2.txt,Yes to no smoking,"I got this assignment to argue for or against something. At first I had no idea of what to write about but then I realized that there is one thing I really have an opinion about; smoking.
Is smoking healthy? No. Does it smell good? No. Is it cool? No! Is it expensive? Yes, and it's a disgusting habit.

All of you who want to die earlier than life has planned, here is some advice. Start smoking. It's really effective, since you get a lot of poisonous material in your lungs. After a while your body breaks down from all the poison and maybe you'll get difficulties to breathe. Before it gets that far, your voice starts to sound strange. It's like you have a filter in your throat that takes away all the sharp and clear sounds; you start talking like a frog. Your face is getting wrinkled and it's like the skin is hanging loose. Sounds great, doesn't it?

The smell, then, is really disgusting. If you stay in a room, where people smoke, for about five minutes your whole body smells like cigarettes. All your clothes, your hair, everything. The only thing that helps is to get a shower - quickly. The smoker's breath is not to play with either. Even if they chew a gum afterwards you can still smell the cigarette through the peppermint taste or whatever it may be. It's like garlic, you can't get rid of the smell.

Many people think it's cool to smoke. That's one of the reasons so many youths start smoking; their friends smoke and they think it's cool. It's not cool to smoke. Just think about it, people standing with a small stick in their mouth. You could as well put a pencil in your nose, it's the same thing, but who would think that is cool? Another point is that smokers lose so much time when they have to go out smoking. I wonder how many hours in a lifetime a smoker spend with the cigarettes. I'm sure they could use the time so much better; learn a language, write a book or get a good night's sleep, more than once a year.

It's expensive to smoke, everybody knows that. I'm not sure how much a packet of cigarettes cost but the last thing I heard was about 40 SKr. That's a lot for 20 cigarettes. It's weird that so many people around the world pay big sums of money to ruin their health and to help destroying the nature. All that money could be spent so much better. It could be used on food to starving people in poor countries, to help people with serious diseases and to save animals under threat of extermination. What a wonderful world it would be!

Once you've started smoking it's really hard to quit, it becomes a habit. Some people manage with just a few cigarettes a day and some become chain-smokers. Of course many people have the strength to quit but sometimes it takes more than one try.

Second hand smoking is almost as dangerous as ordinary smoking. This term means that you get cigarette smoke in your lungs without smoking yourself, just by being around someone smoking. Imagine if there would be ""second hand breaking a leg"", how would we react? If you just watched someone breaking their leg, you would break one too, second hand. 
Most smokers probably show non-smokers respect by smoking outside or in a special room but it doesn't occur to them that they still smell of the smoke when they come back. And in public places, like in the street or in a square, people smoke all the time. Maybe they don't know how smoking effects their body, how dangerous it is, or maybe they just don't care, because people still smoke all over the world and they will continue doing that in the future.

I guess no one can misunderstand what I think of smoking. I think it's disgusting, stupid and NOT cool. The world would be a better place without cigarettes and people would probably live longer. But for now we just have to accept it and make the best out of the situation.",0
159,1095.a2.txt,Stay away from our genes!,"Should people manipulate on genes or not? Some people might say that we need to explore our limits, and therefore investigate how good or bad we can get an animal or crops if we manipulate them. I say, let nature do the work for us!

When talking about gene manipulation, the biggest issue has always been the ethical one. Is it ethical to manipulate on genes in animal or in plants. It might appear to be more ethical to manipulate with plants than on animals because animals are living creatures. I am of the opinion that it is just as unethical to mess with genes in plants that it is in animals. Nature has ""taken care of"" the progress of making plants and animals better and to adapt to its surroundings for millions of years. Nature has made us what we are today. I can't see any reason why we shouldn't let it continue to do so. There is also a religious issue. Many people believe that God created everything. God or the evolution will make all the necessary changes for animals and human beings to survive. God didn't intend for us to inplant new ""stuff"" into things to make them better. If anything needs improvement, God will see to it.

The dangers that I see in gene manipulation are many. For instance, if scientists try to create a new or a better type of vegetable, there is a possibility that the new plant turns into weeds or something else that was not expected. If it turns into weeds, the work and costs of weed control will increase for farmers and the use of chemicals to fight it will also increase, which could damage the environment. However, if the tests are a success, crops can be larger and grow much faster than before. But even if they do so the first couple of years, there is still nothing that says that they will continue to grow big forever. A vegetable can be resistance towards one sort of virus that is crucial for its survival in a specific environment. When manipulated with, it can lose its resistance towards the virus and therefore be extinct. The survival of the fittest theory is put out of play. One can compare this with the Australian farmers who imported frogs. The farmers had problems with insects who destroyed their crops. The frogs were supposed to eat the insects, but the frog propagated so much that it started to eat the crops as well to survive. In the end, the frog itself caused more trouble than it prevented.

If a new, better, vegetable or cereal develops, what's going to be the reaction of those who consume it, animals and human beings? There is a possibility that we may get sick when we eat gene manipulated food, or even worse, our own genes can be rearranged. No one knows. Substances that might cause cancer might develop from the new creations. The substances might not be visible in the beginning, they might show after a few months or a few years. We can never be sure that a product which is not created by evolution is safe. 

In the future, if we continue to manipulate on genes, we might find ourselves in the situation that you can take out patent for genes. If that happens, the big companies which have interests in big or better crops, will get too much power. Money will control. If you have a lot of money, you can basically decide what plant you want to create without thinking of the consequences. The companies can use their money in a way that insures them to make more money. The benefits will not reach the poor people who really need it. 

The people who thinks that gene manipulation is good, argue that we can get medicine or create vaccine for diseases. But then again, I think that the money would control. Only the rich could afford these medicines. In that way, the money decides weather or not we should be able stay healthy.

To mess with genes are none of our business. Evolution has made both people and nature what they are today. If we let it continue to do so, I think that the world would become a better place to live in.",0
160,1097.a2.txt,Are you to decide about life or death?,"Could you picture yourself in a situation where you would have to decide whether another person will get to stay alive or be executed? In countries where the death penalty still is being used as a punishment there are people who make such decisions as a part of their job and in accordance with the law. Although a verdict to sentence someone to death may be legally justified, it cannot be justified as humane and may furthermore have negative impacts on society.
For all that the number of countries using the death penalty has declined over the past years, the capital punishment is still legal in as many as 90 nations around the world. One of the countries where this penalty still is being used is the USA, where approximately seven thousand prisoners have been executed this century. There is no law in the USA saying that a certain crime has to be punished with the death sentence and this means that each court has a lot of power when it comes to deciding who will live and who will not. It is often argued that various forms of discrimination may affect their decisions and although this is often hard to prove, there are many examples that support this statement. A black person who has killed a white is, for example, 11 times more likely to get a death sentence than a white person who has killed a black and men are more likely to be executed than women. Only one percent of all those on death row during the 1980s and early 1990s were women, despite the fact that approximately 15 percent of all criminal homicides are committed by females. 
The juries' and judges' responsibilities of being fair and consistent become even greater considering that verdicts leading to execution never can be reversed once fulfilled. The fact that convicts who have been sentenced to death not can benefit from new evidence diverges them from most other criminals and has in some cases had the result that people have been found innocent after their death. The exact number of innocent people who have been executed will never be known, but according to Amnesty International there have been at least 23 cases in the USA this century and other prisoners who have been wrongly convicted of a crime may be on death row right now. The risk of putting an innocent person to death is by itself a reason good enough for many people to oppose execution of prisoners, whereas some who are in favour of this penalty maintain that it is a price you have to pay in order to ""protect society"".
Other arguments that often are being used in favour of this punishment are that it costs too much to keep convicts in a prison and that the death penalty is a good way of deterring other people from committing crimes. Although the death penalty certainly is an effective way of keeping convicts away from the rest of society, there are other, much more humane solutions to this matter such as imprisonment. In contrast to what many people think, imprisonment is also cheaper than to carry out a death sentence. The reason for this is that trials where the capital punishment is an issue tend to be very long and the costs of judges, public defenders, prosecutors, etcetera consequently rise to very large amounts. Florida, which is one of the American states that exercises the death penalty, has estimated that each execution costs approximately 3,2 million dollars, which is about six times the cost of keeping a convict in prison for life. Most of these costs are covered by taxpayers. 
Imprisonment may also be a better solution than execution in order to prevent subsequent crimes. According to Hugo Adam Bedau ""Capital punishment does not deter crime..."" and an example of this is the state of Oklahoma, where the death penalty was reintroduced in 1990. This reintroduction ""...may have produced an abrupt and lasting increase in the level of strange homicides in the form of one additional stranger homicide per month."" A possible reason for the increase is the lack of good examples that the state provides by using executions as a way of solving problems. 
Although the number of countries using the death penalty has declined, a large number of people - guilty and innocent - are still being executed every year. Could you picture yourself in a situation where you would have to decide whether another person will get to stay alive or be executed? I certainly could not.",0
161,1098.a2.txt,"In the name of Religion, you can get away with anything!","With this argumentative piece I've tried to shed a light on the consequences of religion. What goes on, apart from all of the good deeds man does in the name of religion. I've devided them in five headings, all regarding different aspects of the topic. I myself am not a believer. I'm a naturally born critic or sceptic, if you will. I firmly believe that it should be up to every man/woman to inividually process information and facts that are given or thrown upon us. Just because something has been going on for a long period of time doesn't necessarily mean it's alright.

1) Religion is prohibiting. 
It compromises the person. Religion prevents individual thinking and persuades mankind to accept and ""buy the whole concept"" of its ideas in the scriptures. The scriptures compromise peoples prerogative to think for themselves, they roothlesly rob people of their natural ability to evaluate and act on their own intuition. Religion makes the individual fall in line and not to question anything it says. Is that a good thing, I ask? Is compromising yourself necessary, in the name of religion?

2) Religion causes conflicts. 
Lets look at religion in a passed-present-future perspective.
 I don't think I'm going out on a limb if I point out that more or less all wars, some excluded originates from religious grounds and believes. The discontent of people who don't agree with you or don't share your believes causes conflicts in the name of religion.

3) Religion prevents individual freedom. 
In the end of 1980, an Irish-catholic girl was brutaly raped and got pregnant. She suffered in agony for she wanted to have the foetus removed but her religion forbids abortion. Her case was globaly acknowledged in the media and many, myself included felt for her and witnessed the madness, in the name of religion. The bible, an ancient book of moral clauses and devises for a pure way of life, said she couldn't have an abortion. Luckely she could get help in England and have the abortion done there. Imagine if she hadn't, what life would that child have led!?

4) Religion discriminates. 
Sure, it unifies certain people who share the same ideology. On the other hand it condems different genres even within the same religion and thus the people who don't agree with them. People who don't share their point of view or religious believes. Is it righteous to commit cruel actions as long as it is in the name of religion? 

5) Religious downpayment!?
Even in the early days you were able to go to your church and seek repentance for your sins. You mearly went to a priest and confessed and he would gladly give it to you. He might suggest that you ought to do a few Hail Mary's and suddenly in an instance you had been forgiven. Back then you could even assure your place in heaven when buying a letter of indulgence. Buy your way into the Lords glory, heaven, kingdom or what ever you preferred. Today's version of that same phenomena is called Televangelism. The 80's way to repentance. Televised fundraisings, usually held by a spiritual leader of some kind. He would very convincingly encourage the viewers to support his ""cause"", by donating obnoxiously large sums of money to him and the ""cause"". 
The cause might be o an honest nature, to build evangelist churches or help the poor. But in some cases they were spend for personal gain by the so called prophet. Outrageous news of spiritual leaders spending their money on prostitutes and extramarital affairs. These people who are supposed to set an example to their followers. I guess their only human, but it can't feel all that to be good old Mrs Lewis in the south of California, who recently donated a large sum to ""reverend Chastity"", and learn that he has spent ""her"" money on questionable things, can it!? It's a strange world we live in where some people profits from other peoples misery. 

Conclusion: Imagine a world without prejudice of religion, race, colour or believes! Almost impossible to picture I know. Religion should be more humble and ""human"", it should serve as a medium that brings people together, not to discriminate. I'm not saying that it should be removed or terminated, because many people need to be able to put their trust in a supreme being. It needs to be altered/changed or modified, since everything else has been in order to fit in in today's society. Many vicious things have been done, is being done and will be done in the name of religion. It is not acceptable!

162,1099.a2.txt,Mass Media and Privacy,"The invasion of privacy by the media is always a hot topic. The self-appointed victims on one side - often very famous people - and on the other side the media, who claim the freedom of speech. But when has this freedom gone too far? Do we really have to know every private detail of the world of the famous? The goal is of course to strike a balance between the individual's right to privacy and the public interest in freedom of the press. In this essay I will look at the reporters' checklist when it comes to matters concerning privacy, and also when we feel that they have crossed the line just to get a good story in order to sell a few more copies of a certain tabloid. Let's discuss this matter further on. 
The media should of course have the right to publish any lawfully obtained truthful information. Looking at the sales figures of gossip magazines, we find that a majority of people like to read them, and will pay for such information - by for instance buying a magazine. When publishing companies saw the demand for tabloids from the public, a lot of new gossip magazines were started, and by that of course also a big rivalry between them. In this rivalry it is natural to come up with the flashiest head-lines that attract the interest of the people in order to make them buy just that magazine. And here you will find the problems to this invasion of privacy concerning mostly famous people. Editors want to get their hands on something about someone in the spotlight that no one else has - and if that means painting them in less favourable light, then so be it. 
A certain invasion of privacy can be called the ""false light"". This is what happens when information is published about a public person and causes him/her a wrong reputation. This often happens with politicians. Public figures have a limited right of privacy because they have in a way put themselves in that position of being exposed to scrutiny. The media should however be restricted from publishing information which intrudes upon the privacy of individuals. The reporter should check all the material, and see that no false material is added, and that the arrangements of materials don't give a false impression. But as soon as you put yourself in the spotlight your claims of a right of privacy are limited. Public figures have already taken a stand against this situation by suing the press more and more. Of course, this is something that could be changed if the level of morals in the media raised.
Intrusion claims that result in suing the media often concern the newsgathering process that is to say the wrongful use of tape recorders, cameras and other equipment used for this purpose. The method of obtaining information is something that the reporter has to take in consideration. If we are to give an example of this, one thing that comes to a lot of people's minds is of course the late Diana, Princess of Wales - described by the Earl Spencer as ""the most hunted person of the modern age"". Her death is said by a lot of people to be the media's fault - or especially the paparazzi', who hunted her the last days of her life. But they would of course not exist if there was not a public demand for this type of pictures; this is what sells. The case concerning Diana's death is now closed, and the paparazzi are left without charges. But an event like this must result in a law that will prevent such intrusions. On the other hand, it must be said that Princess Diana herself, after her divorce from Prince Charles, deliberately worked to get the press on her side. And it was told that her manipulating of the media was widely recognised. But as she said herself, she resented the intrusions by the paparazzi, but she got on very well with the tabloid staff photographers. 
A photograph, as well as interview materials, which have a written release may be used. Therefore it is of course essential that a reporter gets such a release. There can be no invasion of privacy if a person consents, as long as the person is not a minor or in any other way not able to give consent. A release is of course something you have to get in the world of advertising. To get a public figure to do a commercial for your product may in most cases rise the sales figures of it. But to use a famous person's name or likeness without consent to sell a product is usually an invasion of privacy. But at the risk of being sued, this it not common these days.
So what overall conclusion can we draw from this? Well, we can all agree that there has to be a freedom of speech in the media, but only to a certain extent. When it is obvious that it is an intrusion of privacy, this must be taken seriously. The standards of the laws that concern this must be kept at a high level. We can clearly see that the individual's right to privacy and the right of freedom of speech often clash. Everyone, famous or not, must feel that they have some privacy. The individual's right of privacy must be considered before the public interest.",0
163,1100.a2.txt,Obsessed Parents,"To become successful in a sport is a dream for a lot of people. What could be better than to earn millions and millions just to kick a ball into a net? What you sometimes don't think about when you watch these famous athletes is the considerable amount of work that they have put into their sport. To have a better chance of succeeding you have to begin to train at an early age. Unfortunately there are many parents and coaches that drive their kids too hard. This can make the child suffer both physically and mentally.

When you're young sports shouldn't be so serious. It should just be a an opportunity to have some fun and meet new friends. Some parents don't understand this and are very committed to making their child the superstar that they always wanted to be. If the child shows that it is very talented in a sport it is put into very hard training. There are numerous stories about coaches who have pressured young kids into achieving goals that they are not yet ready for. Their bodies then react to this with different kinds of disorders. You can see some very frightening examples of this in some sports, for instance gymnastics, where you see young girls with very undeveloped bodies. Seeing the similarities in the bodies of these girls gives you the impression that they have been manipulated with. This is a phenomenon that is very typical of gymnastics and especially connected to countries in Eastern Europe. Some people say that there should be doctors supervising this business and make sure that those who need help get it. I don't think you can appreciate the performance of these athletes because they look so unnatural. The purpose of sports and exercise in general is that you get healthy and feel good. 

Parents are often those who put the most pressure on their children. They want to choose a sport for their child where it can make a lot of money. Money shouldn't be the cause to take up a sport and you shouldn't either specialize in any one sport at an early age. Parents obviously go to different extents when they want their child to be a successful athlete. There are two famous female tennis players, Venus and Serena Williams. Their father had long before they were born decided that they were going to be world class tennis players. When he was looking for a wife he wanted a tall woman because he thought that tennis players benefited from being tall. As soon as they were born he started to train them. This example really shows how far some parents can go in order to achieve something they think the child also wants. 

When you are older and you decide to concentrate on a sport you realize that going to school takes up too much time. Some athletes decide to sacrifice their education for the chance of getting more time to practise. Not having an education is a big problem when your sporting career is over. You will probably have difficulties in finding a job and some people may choose to go back to school in order to get a proper education. Too much practise is a strain on your body and can even cause injuries. Spending a lot of hours in the gym strengthening your body can make you exposed to different performance enhancing drugs such as steroids. If you give in to the temptation and start taking drugs then you are in some serious trouble. Sports are not only very physically demanding but also require a strong mind. You have to be determined and not let failures get to you. It is often in the mental abilities that the difference between today's athletes lies. Those who are able to perform under pressure are the ones most likely to succeed. 

For our physical condition and well-being exercise is of course a good thing. Parents getting involved in their children's lives is also something positive. The examples mentioned earlier are just some extreme cases, most of the time parents aren't that obsessed with making their kids into superstars. Let's hope that everyone can enjoy sports without unbearable demands.",0
164,1102.a2.txt,Euthanasia - a legal way out?,"Some consider euthanasia, help to die, as an immoral act, as murdering another human being. I think that it is far more immoral and inhuman to force a person to suffer in pain from an incurable disease. But should a doctor have the right to end the life of a patient? I think so.
Let us first have a brief look at the present situation in Europe. Is euthanasia considered illegal? The legislation varies from place to place, and you should be aware of the fact that there are two kinds of euthanasia: passive and active euthanasia. 
Passive euthanasia means avoiding life-supporting treatment for a very ill and dying patient. The relatives confer with the doctor and come to the conclusion that the diseased state will not improve and further treatment is avoided. This action is considered legal in Sweden. In the √Öland Islands, for example, people are able to sign an agreement, where they state that they do not want continued treatment in case they would have a severe accident where they would become vegetables for the rest of their lives. They then receive a card, which should always be with them, which shows their choice.
Active euthanasia is to give a very ill, suffering and dying patient a treatment which shortens his / her life. This action is forbidden in Sweden; classified as murder, but in the Netherlands, for example, this is a legally accepted action. The most common ways of shortening the life of a patient are by unplugging a life-saving machine or by giving an overdose of morphine. The decision is made unanimously by the patient, the relatives and the doctors.
One of the big questions is of course if euthanasia is compatible with the Hippocratic oath. Should not doctors save lives, not shorten them? That is, in my opinion, not a very difficult question to answer. You should ask yourself what you prefer; living a life without human dignity in pain, without any chance of ever recovering, or dying a painless death in dignity. For me, the choice is simple. I would never want to force my relatives to live with the burden of me, living a life not worth living. 
There are, however, many other questions left to answer, questions which are not all that simple to answer. Who should make the final decision; the patient or the doctor? In many cases, patients just want to die, not because of the fact that their illness is incurable, but because they simply do not want to cause their relatives trouble with expensive hospital-cost. They might also see themselves as psychical burdens for their families. My opinion is, that the final decision should be made by the patients themselves - but if there are any doubts of the underlying reason for their wish to die, psychiatric specialists should be contacted before any irreversible actions take place. There should never be any doubt of whether the decision is genuinely that of the patient or not. But what if the patient is unconscious, suffers from a severe brain damage? Can his / her relatives then make the decision for him / her? I believe that there is a great risk that euthanasia might be misused, if relatives start making the decisions for the patients. Greedy relatives, yearning for the estate or money of the patient, might choose the easiest way out, by putting their relative to eternal sleep. There are of course also those, who honestly try to follow the wish of the patient by ending his / her sufferings. But who should make the final decision? Can all the responsibility really be placed in the hands of the doctors? Or should every single case go to court, as the procedure is in the Netherlands, in order to follow the law to the point? There are, unfortunately, no good answers to those questions. 
I see euthanasia as help to suicide. Suicide is, at least according to Swedish law, a legal action. Therefore, I see nothing illegal at all in euthanasia, as long as it follows the wish of the patient. According to my opinion it will be very difficult to make a law that satisfies everybody. Personally, I think that everybody should have to sign an agreement, such as the voluntary one of the √Öland Islands. Then there would be no doubt whether the wish of the patient would be followed or not. 
Euthanasia is quite a controversial subject and almost everyone has an opinion. In my opinion euthanasia should be a legal alternative to unnecessary suffering.",0
165,1103.a2.txt,The winner of the battle between glasses and contact lenses: glasses.,"This assignment was to write an argumentative essay, and I did not know what to write about. After thinking long and hard I decided to write about the different aspects of glasses and contact lenses. I do not wear either one myself, but by looking at the aspects for and against both of them, I will show you why I think glasses are a much better choice than contact lenses.

First of all I want to write about the actual purpose with glasses or contact lenses. That is to be able to use your eyes without overstraining them and to see without problems. If you only have a minor problem with your eyes and only need glasses for reading, then you do not have a choice but to wear glasses. You cannot take the lenses out as soon as you do not read anymore, especially if you are in school attending a lecture where you first look at the blackboard and then in your books or writing-pad and back again. Neither can you have progressive contact lenses, only glasses. There are many kinds of cuts that you can have with glasses but not lenses, so therefor contact lenses are only for a limited clientele - the ones with the ""correct defects"".

I will continue by describing the troubles you can come upon with both glasses and contact lenses. Glasses can be in the way for example if you work out or if it is raining outside. But when you wear lenses you increase the danger of getting dry or red eyes, an eye disease or any other similar problem. It is unnatural to poke around in your eyes and glasses will help you to get around that problem. You can also wear glasses for much longer at a time without risking sore or dry eyes. Some people may say that glasses are more breakable, which is true, however, contact lenses are much more vulnerable. They are small, practically invisible and soft. It is easy to lose a lens if you are careless enough to drop it, or to get a scratch which makes the lens useless. 

When it comes to the costs you have one sum to pay for glasses but you have to get new lenses quite often and you also have the lens fluid to buy. Of course the cost depends on where you buy them and also if you happen to get unexpected costs by broken glasses or lenses. If your eyes suddenly get worse it might be easier to change contact lenses, but it is doubtful that the eyes would change so suddenly.

Last but not least I want to bring up the fashion. Both glasses and contacts have been an important accessory to today's fashion. You can change the color of your lenses, or even to get the Swedish flag in your eyes and you have thousands of spectacle frames to choose from. One might say that if you invest quite a lot of money in a pair of glasses you can only wear them as long as the fashion stays the same. I do not agree. You do not have to have the latest to be in style. You can use the same kind of glasses as your grandmother if you like and still be in fashion. Fashion is a state of mind and no one can tell you what to wear or not. Some people buy the latest from the optician's and change spectacle frames more often than others do. To them that is nothing more than a change in their outfit. I think it is fun to wear colored contact lenses - once or twice, but not every day. The eyes are the mirror of our soul and should not be changed. You do not change your looks at all if you wear uncolored lenses and that is one of the major reasons why people choose to have contacts instead of glasses. But to see people with different kinds of glasses makes me happy. Glasses make their whole face light up.

From what I can understand, to wear glasses is more sufficient for many more defects of the eye, it is cheaper, easier to vary and do not give you any extra troubles with your eyes such as dry eyes for example. You can through your glasses show who you are and change your overall look. I only wish I could have a pair...",0
166,1104.a2.txt,Stop the use of genetic engineering.,"Genetic engineering is when a gene is transformed from one species to another, to improve or to give it a new or a better quality. There are advantages and disadvantages with this technique but as long as we don't know the exact consequences, I think that we shouldn't use it at all. For example, this technique makes it possible for maize to produce its own insecticide and tomatoes can be more aromatic if we slow down the growing process. Well, this seems to be advantages but there are a couple of questions, for instance, how would the genetic engineering impact the surrounding environment? What happens with the biodiversity? What does it mean for allergic persons and what if the technique is used on humans? The final question that will be dealt with in this essay are the socio-economical results of the Green Revolution. 

Could gene modified plants impact the surrounding environment? Well, one risk is that the modified plant could become a weeds and therefore a problem both in and outside the cultivated area. Another risk is that the new quality, in the modified plant, could affect other plants and the result could lead to unwanted effects on the ecosystem. The insect-resident maize could for example lead to distinction of an insect species in an area. Consequently, this could be devastating for the animals that depend on this special insect. Furthermore, the ecological risks with gene modified plants can be difficult to predict because it could take years before the effects shows.

Genetic engineering threatens the biodiversity. Biodiversity means the variety within and between species and ecosystems. Modified plants are usually cultivated in many places around the world, and therefore replace many natural plants. This would lead to a loss of genetic resources. We should be extra careful since the ruthless deforestation in the tropics has resulted in distinction of many species. There are a lot of species in the tropics today that we don't even know about. Therefore, will the genetic resources hidden in the tropics, be even more valuable when the use of genetic engineering increases. 

When a commodity is genetically modified, how could the consumers know if it isn't allergenic. Furthermore, what would this mean for persons who are allergic already. We won't know until they've tried.

What would happen with our world if we started to use this technique on humans, if we started to change the gene pools of humans? Technically this is possible today. In other words it would be possible to take away a gene and replace it with another. If this would be done by wrong people the results could be devastating. What would have happened if Hitler had had the opportunity to use this technique, would he have made humans with blond hair and blue eyes? However, to manipulate the human gene pool would be to restrict the biodiversity even more.

Today there are some visible impacts due to genetic engineering. The Green Revolution, which started back in the 1970s, was an attempt to increase the harvests in third world countries. With help from genetic engineering it was possible to increase the harvests of rise and wheat, but the new crops wasn't for free. It was only the rich farmers in the third world that could afford to buy them and consequently they sold the outcome on the world market, because the people in the third world couldn't afford it. What started as a good intention led to more starvation for the already starving people. This is an important socio-economical consequence which shouldn't be forgotten about when we try to increase the world production of food with help from genetic engineering. 
Conclusion

Although there are some advantages with genetic engineering, like insect resident maize and tomatoes with more aroma, the disadvantages are in the majority in my opinion. I don't think that it is worth risking the biodiversity or that a modified plant spreads to other ecosystems, just to have better tasting tomatoes. Above all I wouldn't risk that the technique gets into wrong hands and we get humans whose gene pool is manipulated after a special pattern. So, as long as we don't know the exact consequences I think that we should be extremely cautious and don't use the technique at all.",0
167,1105.a2.txt,IMPRISONED MOTHERS: A THREAT TO SOCIETY!/?,"I was deeply moved when I a while ago watched a documentary on Swedish television about women with a life sentence who had children at home. Having witnessed this trauma, I now realize that I and everybody else in the Swedish society have a responsibility to work for changes of this very specific part of the Swedish legal system.
I am not arguing whether it is generally right or wrong to keep men and women in prison. I feel that imprisoned mothers present a very special case that needs discussion because it is, as I see it, violating the human (read: children 's) rights to a certain extent. Excluding extreme cases, every child should have a right to be with its mother. You might argue that women in prison are extreme cases, however one of my points is that there are different ways of looking at this. Unless the mother abuses drugs or alcohol or the child, a child is never better off without its mother. In actual fact, separating mother and child can be devastating since the child will not be able to understand why the mother cannot be there.
To look at one specific case, there was one mother in the documentary mentioned above, who had started serving off a life sentence for allegedly having killed her husband, something which she had however denied in court. The lack of this woman 's presence at home was next to unbearable for her young daughter. After some time the mother received the results from an investigation made about her, that was going to decide whether she was dangerous to society or not, and consequently whether she should be granted leave every once in a while. The result proved itself to be for her benefit, why in my opinion there should be no reason for her having to stay in prison at all, considering the fact of there being a child in the family. For one we do not know for sure that she committed the crime she is serving time for (which is even beside the point in this matter). Secondly, reaching the conclusion that somebody is no danger to other people, should not depend on a timeframe - not dangerous when on leave but certainly if she would be totally freed. That must be their logic though. Surely the time spent behind bars is supposed to be seen as some kind of punishment, though is not the point with prisons in to rehabilitate their inmates, not to cause them emotional damage? When it comes to imprisoned mothers it is their children who suffer the biggest punishment, which is why keeping these women in prison is a way of damaging the next generation and thus creating future problems in society.
 Discussing an inmate 's possibility of being dangerous and come to be of the opinion that he/ she is not, does of course not always mean that this can be looked upon as a pure fact. Therefore it could be argued that my demands of freeing certain women in prison are unrealistic. However, in this particular case (imprisoned mothers) it could be worth it, giving these people the benefit of the doubt, not by completely slackening the reins, but by compromising. One suggestion would be letting the mothers live at home but having a prison guard checking up on them as often as is felt needed in each particular case. This should not be an economical impossibility either, since it is quite expensive, having people in prison. Another arrangement would be for the convicted to wear an electronic foot shackle for a certain amount of time and meanwhile be living at home. This is in fact an effective way of seeing to it that the person in question does not cause trouble.
It is so easy to generalize when it comes to prisoners and state that they are all bad and should stay behind bars as long as possible, without looking at the possible ""side effects"" of their imprisoning. I have taken my personal stand when it comes to mothers in prison as a particular group because society could have more to lose than to gain by keeping these women as inmates. Their important role as mothers to their children, on a physical as well as an emotional level must not be ignored no matter what. Let us compromise and find the better alternatives to a stay in prison. In the end it is what is best for the children that matters. We always say that the children are our future, that is: all children, and if we still believe this, here is a reason to raise our voices for them!",0
168,1106.a2.txt,Life on other planets:fiction or fact?,"The universe is, as far as we know, endless and for ages people have gazed up at the stars and wondered - ""Are we alone?"". Many would say that we are, that life on other planets is just fiction, but I'm convinced that we are not alone and that life on other planets is a fact.
There are billions of galaxies in the universe and every galaxy has billions of stars. If just a fraction of those stars hosted planets and a fraction of those planets were inhabited, it would mean that there are millions of civilizations out there. This, in my opinion, shows great probability of extraterrestrial life. These planets may not be as equally developed as earth. Many of them may in fact just have started producing life in form of small organisms or bacteria. Others may have reached the Jurassic period, or they may even be more technologically advanced than us. Astronomers have confirmed that the Sun and the galaxy, which make our existence possible, are not unusual or basically different from other galaxies and stars. Scientific and technical research in order to find extraterrestrial life is being performed at many institutions around the world. 
The Phoenix project at SETI (""the search for extraterrestrial intelligence"") is an effort to detect extraterrestrial civilizations by listening for radio signals that are transmitted from another planet. So far no clear transmission have been found. Does this mean that there are no other civilizations out there? No. The problem with radio signals is that it takes time for them to travel through space. All the stars and galaxies are at such a distance that it would take many years, maybe several generations, for the signals to get through to earth. The fact that we don't hear anything now, doesn't mean that we won't hear anything in the future. Another explanation is that the ""civilizations"" that are at a reachable distance from earth have not yet developed a technology that makes it possible to transmit signals. 
The possibility of extraterrestrial intelligence sometimes urge people to search for ""little green men"", riding around in their space crafts and hassling earthlings. Would it be conceivable that at least one of all those possible civilizations is so technologically advanced that they have the ability to travel through space? I think so. Unfortunately, people tend to put UFOs in the same category as ghosts and other supernatural occurrences. We know that there is nothing supernatural about a Space Shuttle, but to people in the Middle Ages it would have seemed magical or supernatural. So, UFOs could probably best be explained as an extrapolation of where our own technology might be thousands of years from now. 
UFO sightings have been reported all over the world, but one particular incident is well documented and rather well known. It is the incident in Roswell, New Mexico in the year 1947. Colonel William Blanchard, Commander of the 509th Bomb Group, issued a press release stating that the wreckage of a ""crashed disc"" had been recovered. Within hours, a second press release was issued from the U.S. government saying that the wreckage in fact was a weather balloon. People who knew William Blanchard say that he would never have made a fool of him self and the Air Force by ordering a press release about something so out of the ordinary without being certain he was correct. Credible witnesses, including retired generals, have testified that the original press release issued by Blanchard was correct. Why would the government cover-up a story if it only concerned a weather balloon? It had to be a space craft that crashed at Roswell. 
There are three possible reasons for a cover-up: fear of mass panic, national security, and concern about offending religious groups. First and foremost, we have been living with AIDS, terrorism and violent crimes for such a long time, that a confirmation of extraterrestrial intelligence would hardly create a mass panic in this day and age. As for national security, it would be reasonable that the government would want to keep certain details of that new technology secret, but the mere knowledge about the existence of such a space craft would not be of any threat to the nation. Religion, on the other hand, would have to adapt to the possibility that there is life out there, just as it did when Copernicus and Darwin presented their discoveries. 
In conclusion to these facts I would say that there has to be life on other planets. This is not merely my own belief, but there have been far too many credible witnesses, like U.S. Air Force pilots, reporting UFOs, too much government secrecy and too many mathematically proven possibilities of extraterrestrial intelligence, that the only possible explanation to all of this is that there is life in space.",0
169,1109.a2.txt,Children need a mother and a father,"In society of today homosexuality is often debated. One topic frequently discussed in media is if homosexual couples should be treated by society the same way as heterosexual pairs, should they have the right to get married and in that case get the same legal rights as married couples?
 An ongoing debate is whether homosexuals should have the same right as married couples to adopt children or not. My opinion is that homosexuals under no circumstances should be able to adopt children.

Firstly, I do not approve of homosexuals having children since they cannot have them in a natural way. If God meant for two men or women to have children he would have constructed them that way. The female body is constructed for pregnancies, but in order to get pregnant there has to be a man involved. It is not biologically possible for two human beings of the same gender to have children, there has to be a male and a female having sex in order for the woman to conceive. Having children is a natural process and is something beautiful a man and a woman share. 

Secondly, allowing innocent children to grow up with homosexual parents can be putting the child's health at risk. Children can be very cruel to each other and if you are different you easily get teased. Kids get teased for wearing the wrong clothes or having a different haircut, what will happen to a child with two fathers or two mothers? The answer is quite simple, the young boy or girl will have a hard time getting nasty comments from his or her classmates in school. He or she will most certainly feel left out. 

A great deal of adults are prejudice against homosexuals and they, consciously or not, pass that over to their children. There is a big risk that a child to homosexuals will be lonely with few or no friends at all. This can effect the child's future, being lonely and abused for a longer period can lead to depressions and mental illness. Is it worth risking a child's health letting it be raised by two persons of the same sex? Experimenting with human lives are dangerous and should not be accepted. 

Thirdly, an adopted child are different from other kids with Swedish parents, the child may have a different skin colour or an unusual name, and when they come to Sweden they should be guaranteed a stabile and normal life. Being adopted you are already different, but if growing up in a stabile loving and caring family I am certain that adopted children grow up to be responsible and caring individuals. Having to grow up in a family with homosexual parents may be too much for that child. We know that adopted children are wondering about their biological parents and some are wondering why they were sent away and why did their not parents love them? These problems get bigger at their teens when they discover their sexuality. Having two parents of the same gender might be too much to bare for a child, being attracted of a person of the opposite sex, how will they feel about that? 

To sum up I have three main arguments why not to allow homosexual couples to adopt children. First of all, it is not biologically possible for homosexuals to have children and therefor not meant to be. Another argument is the abuse the child probably will have to put up with at school, from friends and from other adults. Most adopted children come from non European countries and have different looks compared to Swedes, in order to feel loved and become individuals with great self esteem they should have the right to a home as normal as possible.",0
171,1121.a2.txt,Is homosexuality unnatural and unethical? (...and does it really matter?),"This summer I followed a dialogue in the local newspaper in Link√∂ping. It was about homosexuality. The whole thing started when the controversial piece of art called ""Ecce Homo"" (it shows scenes from the life of Christ in a homosexual environment) came to town. The paper published an article about the ordinary life of homosexuals. Two days later an angry reader wrote to the paper loudly protesting against the way the paper painted out homosexuality as something positive. If the same opinions were directed openly towards foreigners in Sweden, it would be a criminal act.

The most common argument against homosexuality is that it is unnatural. But what is the definition of natural? If something is natural, does it automatically mean that it is good (or bad)? Homosexuality is natural in the sense that it has always existed in human society. In the Mesopotamian epic about King Gilgamesh (written down about 4500 years ago) homosexual-ity is described as something perfectly normal and the greatly respected Socrates is believed to have uttered the words: ""The purest of loves is the love between a mature man and a young boy"". But if this means that homosexuality is natural, the same must go for phenomena like rape, war and murder. Shall we accept/condemn something just because it always has been a part of human society?
Another aspect is the technical impossibility for a gay/lesbian couple to produce offspring. This shows according to some that it is against nature. Important here is to separate the in-stinct to propagate and sexuality. If (gay/lesbian-) sex is to be called unnatural because of the disability to produce offspring, then must all use of preventives also be unnatural. One could even say that each time a 'straight' couple has sex without the intention of producing off-spring, it would be an unnatural act. It sounds pretty silly, doesn't it?
Others see homosexuals and their disability to reproduce as a part of evolution, a way for Mother Earth to control a rapidly increasing birth rate in an over-populated world. But then we have to keep in mind that not all people believe in the evolution...
One contributor to the debate argued that what we need in Sweden is a Christian revival. She pointed out that homosexuality was a sin and more or less a 'highway to hell'. To support her opinions she quoted the passage in the Bible about Sodom and Gomorrah. What she prob-ably did not know though is that the word translated into homosexuality in the Bible most probably is a mistranslation of a word that actually means promiscuity.
To be honest I am not a believer but I still find it very upsetting that a person with such strong beliefs as she, has the nerve to condemn people of a certain sexual identity in God's name. Jesus tried to teach us that it doesn't matter who you are, or what you have done as long as you believe. Anyone may come to God. Christian fundamentalists tend to forget that the Bible was not written by God but by human beings. The Old Testament and its doctrines (from 1200-150 BC) became obsolete with the New Testament, which was finished 367AD and depicts society and the spirit of that time. One has to keep that in mind for Christ's sake (literally)! I don't think many ""good"" Christians would slaughter and cut up their wives as punishment for being raped (the Book of Judges 19:1 - 19:30).
Isn't it quite strange that people in our society get oppressed because of their choice of partner? I would find it quite nasty to be slandered, despised, threatened and beaten because I fancy brunettes! Most people agree that violence against homosexuals is unacceptable, but many of those people find it perfectly all right to slander and joke about gays and lesbians. It is important to point out that a more or less publicly accepted verbal lynch-mob and the many acts of violence against homosexuals are very closely related. And personally, I think that the best way to cope with these social problems is to give homosexual couples the same legal rights as heterosexual, the right to marry and to adopt children. Only then will it dawn for the many homophobics of today that those gays and lesbians are ordinary people, the only difference between us and them, is what kind of partner they fancy to live their lives with.

The question if homosexuality is natural or not should be, as I have tried to show here, very unimportant. And every sane person must understand that a good and loving God never would condemn or repudiate love, no matter towards whom it is aimed! The choice of sexual-/life partner is a human right.",0
172,2000.a2.txt,NA,"INTRODUCTION
It's not an unknown truth that we all are influenced by TV. (In particular children are open in their sense for new impressions.) Teenagers live in a period of life when their sexuality is wakening, which gives them a lot of questions. I maintain that hard pornographic movies give an awful and disgusting view about what sexuality is. They can do a great deal of harm to those who are watching them - and they are presented for money. It's also necessary to seriously consider if Swedish law is compatible with showing these kinds of movies.

PROBLEM
The hard pornographic movies are detrimental for everyone, and the use of the Swedish law towards it is today not hard enough. I should prefer that the procuring law were used against pornographic movies.

ARGUMENTATION
The sexuality crimes are from 1992 increasing in Sweden, and the behaviour of the criminals are quite equal with how the actors behave in the hard pornographic movies. Recently Olof Risberg visited the school from which the teenagers, who raped a young girl in Rissne, came. He found out that 50% of the boys were watching pornographic movies every day, and the same percentage believed that girls are whores. It's hard to prove that these kinds of movies are the reason why the sexual crimes increase or that they have changed the teenagers's view of what sexuality is. Neverless I mean that these hard pornographic movies don't convey anything good. In one movie, for example, you can see seven men wearing masks (probably to protect their personality) penetrate and degrade a woman. Such things give a sick view.

Many people were choked after having watched the documentary movie about pornography, ""Shocking Truth"" by Alexa Wolf, in the Swedish parliament. They could not understand how it can be possible to show hard pornographic movies in Swedish TV. Marita Ulvskog, our Cultural cabinet minister, maintains that the purpose of the law is to stop these kinds of movies and we need to investigate what we can do to solve the problem. Their reaction (as well as my own and many others's) indicates that it's important to stop hard pornographic movies from being shown in TV. 

The Swedish law regulates what the mark grounded TV stations offer, so that they don't allow any pornographic movies in Swedish Television. The law concerning cable TV stations, according pornographic movies, says that they are not allowed to show any sexual violence or force. If they don't define ""violence"" and ""force"" in a better way the interpreter is left to interpret these words in a subjective way. In my opinion this is not enough. A weird and completely illogical thing is that when cable TV stations send their pornographic movies, which is allowed according to Swedish law, they also send some advertising movies directed towards children - and then Swedish law reacts against the advertising movies and says these are illegal! 

The pornographic movies in the world totally turn over about 260 billion Swedish crowns every year, according to Forbes Magazine. Pornography has become an industry which is based on and ruled by money. The procurer law we have in Sweden doesn't allow any money involved in practice of sexually activities. If we used the procurer law against the pornography movies they would be forbidden to produce, as well as distribute and send and sell in Sweden. The pornographic video movies would then also be forbidden. I suggest that we use the procurer law against pornographic videos because it would stop the hard pornographic movies. 

CONCLUSION
We are all influenced by TV, though especially the younger generation. Hard porno movies have a bad influence and I think it's necessary to protect the younger generation from that kind of movies sent by TV. The procurer law should release us from pornographic movies.",0
173,2005.a2.txt,Animals do not need human intelligence!,"In our time and culture humans generally consider themselves to be the most intelligent species on earth. We constantly compare ourselves to other animals, always arriving at the conclusion that humans, not animals, are superior. I would like to argue that the ways by which animals are judged for intelligence, or lack of it, are wrong. What is considered intelligent by humans might not be the most intelligent thing for a giraffe or a dolphin in the context of their environment and behaviour. My aim is to show how bias and narrow minded human attempts as to decide animal intelligence often are.

Looking for similarities
Humans define their intelligence in comparison to what other animals lack. This is discrimination of animal intelligence. Not being alike becomes synonymous with being unequal in a way that resembles racism. People argue that the very fact that man has spread all over the world and conquered the environment clearly stands to show for his intelligence. Or they might state that it is people that hold animals, not the other way around. That, I say, isn't a sign of human intelligence anymore than it was that the whites kept slaves in the nineteenth century. Looking for similarities can lead people to favour certain animals. Ants have often captivated mans interest due to their architectural skills and social structure, that could find parallels in human society. Should that fact alone put ants higher on the intelligence hierarchy, than for example mosquitoes? Vainly man often comes to that conclusion. I argue that the ant is intelligent whether or not it resembles man in any way, as is the mosquito.

Testing animals for IQ 
Man has often made the mistake of rating intelligence from his own understandings and experiences. At the beginning of the twentieth century IQ was mass-tested on immigrants to the United States to determine whether or not they could stay. An enormous proportion was diagnosed as imbeciles due to the poor results. Later critics raised their voices against the tests that often contained questions on American culture that no immigrant possibly could know, and that in a language that most didn't speak! The way we test animals for intelligence today bares much resemblance to the way those IQ-tests were executed a hundred years ago; always judging from our own perspective, and always asking for resemblance. When testing animals for intelligence we often test their ability to count or their communication skills. Animals at testing laboratories are reduced to having only one task - to show human skills.

Every species is unique
All species have their own specific senses and use them differently; a dog's sense of smell, for example, is a hundred times better than a human's, dolphins use ultra sound to see scrimps at the bottom of the ocean, and flies have compound eyes with which they see a completely different world to us. When judging animals we must keep this in mind. Furthermore, we must assume that we don't understand everything about them and their own comprehension of life. 
Finally, self-reflection is considered to show the highest level of human intelligence. Asking who we are, and being able to look at ourselves objectively, are the signs of intelligence that humans do not want to admit to be true for animals. I argue that no one knows what goes on in the brains of other humans, let alone of our animal friends, and still we deny them the ability to think. How is it tested? By putting animals in front of mirrors and seeing how they react. If they react like us - ""good"", and if they don't - ""fail"". Is it so impossible to think that the animal's comprehension of its self could take another form than ours and therefore be expressed differently? After all, our own view upon identity is both cultural and historical. Some native people think that their sole will be captured when confronted with a camera, and our culture knew very little of the ""subconscious"" until Freud told us. Putting animals in front of mirrors just is not going to tell us what they think of themselves.

Conclusion
I have argued that animal- and human intelligence can not be compared in a simple way. Most attempts so far have been to find ""human"" behaviour in animals, but I have objected to that as being a narrow-minded method and not leading to greater understanding of animal intelligence. It is obvious that every species live under unique conditions that we need to take into account. Every species has its way of living through their unique senses. This will ultimately create different intelligences. Having opened up their eyes to this, humans can stop searching for themselves in animals, and start to see their intelligence for what it is - uniqe and brilliant!",0
174,2007.a2.txt,Systembolaget open on Saturdays - something to worry about?,"Sweden has a restrictive policy concerning alcohol. The goal is to decrease or at least retain the total consumption, and this is motivated by health care reasons. Since we joined the EC, this policy has become more difficult to live up to. An example is that the question about whether Systembolaget is to be open on Saturdays or not, is a topical issue today. Some shops in the country will be open as an experiment during year 2000. For many people, this is good news, while others are worried about the consequences. 
I do not think that Systembolaget should be open on Saturdays. I believe that such a change in policy would make the situation worse for the victims of violence caused by alcohol, and I do not think that the arguments used by the spokesmen for extended opening hours do make enough sense to justify that. I am going to explain my standpoint in two ways; first by discussing the most reasonable argument for extended opening hours, and then by giving my view on why Systemetbolaget should be closed on Saturdays. 
There are of course many arguments used by the ayes. But with today's knowledge about the social and medical problems related to alcohol, there is only one that makes any sense. It could be put like this: ""Systembolaget have to provide better service or otherwise they will not be able to conquer with the illegal liqour trade. One way to do this would be to be open on Saturdays."" The spokesmen for this point of view believe that, in order to prevent the negative effects of alcohol abuse, there is no point in limited opening hours as long as the black market is as strong as it is. A regained control over the market helps limit excessive drinking and also the number of young people with alcohol problems. This view is supported by Anita Johansson, who is a social democratic member of parliament, and Bertil Swartz, spokesman for the Swedish Brewer Association, among others. They are absolutely right in pointing out that illegal liqour is a problem. About 35% of the alcohol consumed in Sweden is sold on the black market. It is also shown that big consumers of alcohol buy illegal liqour to a relatively greater extent than others. And it is among these people most of the social problems are to be found. 
Nevertheless, it is also a fact that increased obtainability causes an increase in consumption. And the total consumption in an area is strongly correlated to how many big consumers that can be found there, as shown by the French scientist Sully Ledermann, in a theory called ""the model of total consumption"". Therefore, the argument above makes sense only if the possible decrease in illegal trade should at least equal the probable increase in liqour sold by Systembolaget. However, this is poorly proved.
Moreover, by using extended opening hours at Systembolaget as a weapon against black trade, it will take a long time before the regained control over the alcohol trade is a fact. Meanwhile, the total consumption will increase and many people will have their lives destroyed. Increased obtainability cannot be the best way of dealing with the illegal liqour problem.
A crucial point that is overlooked in the argumentation discussed above is that in spite of all that is said about illegal liqour some of the domestic violence is still caused by liqour sold by Systembolaget. That problem can in no way be dealt with by opening on Saturdays.
This leads to what I think is the main advantage of the system we have today. It is perhaps a not well-known fact that many alcoholics drink most in the middle of the week. This is simply because it is too boring to go to Systembolaget on Fridays, and impossible in the weekend. I am now talking about those who do not buy illegal liqour (being an alcoholic does not necessarily mean being a criminal). Thanks to this, some families of the violent addicts sometimes might have a ""free Sunday"", when they do not get beaten up. 
Of course there are also medical and economical reasons to limiting the obtainability of alcohol, but I think that sympathy with the victims of domestic violence is still the most obvious one. The personal advantages of Systembolaget being open on Saturdays, such as personal freedom and comfort, are luxuries not defendable in this context. Go on living as we do now is a tiny sacrifice for lucky people who do not have serious social problems, if it can help only one person from getting beaten up or killed one day. It is a question of solidarity.
The conclusion must be that our restrictive policy concerning alcohol must remain, and that the illegal alcohol market must be dealt with in other ways than allowing Systembolaget to be open on Saturdays.",0
175,2009.a2.txt,Capital punishment in Sweden?,"In to day's society the criminality seems to get harder and harder. Every day you hear or read about murder, rape, child abuse and maltreatment which has led to demands on firmer punishment and harder control on ex-criminals.
One punishment that has several times been brought up in the discussion is the capital punishment, mostly for crimes like murder, child abuse and high treason.
But is capital punishment the most suitable punishment and shall we introduce it in Sweden? I personally say no and I have a lot of argument for my opinion, which I am going to present in this essay.

Those that are pro-capital punishment use often the argument that with this punishment there are no relapse criminals. I can buy that argument but on the other hand, there are neither no criminals that can change and do well for human kind. It is true that there are no relapse criminals but if the convicted was innocent there are no way that you can give him his life, self-esteem and honour back.

Another favourite argument is that it is more economical with capital punishment instead of keeping the criminals in prison. That has been proved wrong. In a report from the Judicial Conference of the United States on the costs of the federal death penalty, it was reported that the defence costs was about 4 times higher in cases where death was sought than in comparable cases where death was not sought. Moreover, the prosecution costs in death cases were 67 % higher than in the defence costs. Besides that, the convicted have a tendency to appeal and that costs more.
Many that is pro-capital punishment use to say that it is derrent for others that are planning crimes which would led to death if getting caught. Many researches in countries that have capitol punishment proves nothing else than if you want to lessen criminality it is the chance to get caught that matters, not the punishment.

In the States they have done some researches on which it is that will be convicted to death and it turned out to be those incapable of defending them selves. It turned out that courts have a tendency to look upon the prosecutes race, religion, social status and so on. 1977 to 1998 500 people got executed and of the 81.8 % had killed white even though black and white are victims of the same amount of crimes. So capital punishment is also a matter of race discrimination.

One of my favourite arguments against capital punishment is that it is against the law in Sweden. Our law says that it is forbidden to kill someone whatever he or she have done and whoever convict some one to death, is he not a killer? Who has the right to take another humans life just because the law says that is all right? 

Instead of capital punishment we have to goo deeper in our search for a solution to this growing problem. Statistics from other countries shows that brutal criminal acts come as a result of political instability, poverty and other disruption in our society. When using capital punishment we are not solving anything, only hides our heads in the sand. 

So I am against capital punishment in Sweden (and the rest of the world) because it is cruel, unnecessary, costs a lot, against the Swedish law and a matter of racial discrimination.
Last but not least, it is inhuman to kill some one no matter what that person has done. 
I would like to end this essay with a cite from one of my favourite books that very well summarise the main reason for me being against capital punishment, it is taken from ""The lord of the rings"" by J R R Tolkien. ""Many men that are dead deserves to live and many men that are alive deserves to die but if you cannot awake a dead man you should not be so eager to make a living man dead"".",0
176,2011.a2.txt,Legislate against smoking - which is most important; the smoker's right to intoxicate or everybody else's right to breathe?,"If cigarettes would have been introduced to the market today, they would most certainly have been classified as illegal drugs straight away. Nicotine is one of the most addictive substances we know of, and is added to the cigarettes for that reason. 

We have been aware of the health consequences of smoking for a long time now. Studies have shown that smokers are in bad condition compared to non-smokers. This is not only because smokers tend to lead less active and healthy lives in other aspects, but with tobacco usage as the main reason. Other researches have shown links between various cancers and smoking, particularly lung cancer. Smokers tend to be on sick-leave from work more often than non-smokers, probably because of bronchitis, coughs, influenzas and other forms of bronchus deficiencies. Pregnant women are being warned of smoking since it has devastating effects on the foetus. In spite of this, infants are still being born sickly with low weight, asthmas, allergies and sometimes with withdrawal symptoms. Still many people maintain that it should be the individual's choice, a right to weigh the pleasure against the risks and then make a decision. I claim that it should not. 

It should not be the smokers' sole decision since he is not the only victim of smoking. It is fair to say that everyone knows about the discomfort smoking gives to asthmatics and allergy sufferers. Unfortunately, there has been little evidence that cigarettes are a health threat to others than the smoker. Lately, however, doctors have realised that even non-smokers are suffering from lung cancer due to cigarettes. 

The tobacco companies have been very much aware of the health hazards, but have chosen to hush the matter. Many former employees claim that their employers tried to keep them quiet with both silent and spoken threats and contracts of professional secrecy. People who have indeed stood up against the hypocritical giants are being sued and pursued. Several Hollywood productions have shed light on the matter, the most recent being ""Insider"", in which you can see the tobacco companies' presidents swearing that they had no knowledge of the dangers of smoking before this became public. That these intelligent educated people would believe inhaling nicotine and tar should be innoxious is not very credible. In other words they are lying. Unfortunately, they are getting away with it probably because of the enormous lucrativity of the tobacco industry. 

It is difficult to know whether society profits or looses financially on the tobacco industry. The luxury taxes are quite high and in that sense it is profitable, but in return huge amounts of money go to hospital expenses, nursing and treatment of tobacco related deceases like pulmonary emphysema which is very costly. Due to the dangers of smoking we have a law against selling tobacco to minors. The government also runs non-smoking campaigns, informative lectures, anti-smoking advertisement and suchlike. These activities are expensive and, I am sad to acknowledge, rather fruitless. Evidently I believe that it is an economical loss, specially for the non-smoking part of our society. Even if it was not a loss, wouldn't we be tremendously cynical to allow the intoxication because it is profitable? 

The moral issue is very important in this discussion since many are claiming that legislation restricts freedom. But on the contrary, the lack of laws against smoking limits the non-smokers' freedom and imposes on our well being. Smoking is a nuisance. It spreads a sickening smell, both the smoke and the smoker. After having entered a restaurant lacking a no-smoking sign, your entire outfit has to be washed. 

Personally, I have grown tired of living in a foggy, grey, smelly world, just because of our fellow-creatures' choice to poison themselves. Despite the high tobacco prices, the well-known damage due to cigarettes and the manipulation of the tobacco companies, smokers still wallow in the objects of their addiction. It is clear to me that we are in great need of protection against our own and our fellow-beings' stupidity. This is why I am urging for a legislation against usage of tobacco. Not only for the smokers' sake, but for the society.",0
177,2012.a2.txt,Why censorship in movies is a Bad Thing,"Censor v - to examine books, films, letters etc to remove anything that is considered offensive, morally harmful or politically dangerous etc. (Source: Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English)

The word censorship gives many people a foul taste in the mouth, and in this essay I will discuss why it should do just that. This discussion is applicable to most forms of censorship, but I will focus on the censorship of films. I also choose to only lightly touch the self-sensoring made by directors and film studios. Also, the discussion is not focused on a particular country.

Why is the discussion of censorship so important? This is why: Censorship, the removal of sections of the film seen unsuitable for public viewing, is nothing less than creative crippling, and hinders freedom of speech and freedom of mind. Some films are even entirely banned from a country due to what is seen as unproper content. It is the dictation by the few to the many, or rather, the withholding of information from many by the few, to twist some words.

The use of censorship often reflects the minds of the more prudent inhabitants of a state, and their wishes to control the public. There are telling examples, a recent one being the treatment of Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut in USA. The conservative notion that sex and nudity is not for decent people resulted in the removal of very large sections of the film, thus severely altering and diminishing it's artistical impact. Should a small elitist board of self-righteous people really have this power over such a creative medium? 

It can definitely be argued that the removal of small parts of a movie doesn't necessarily alter it's intended meaning or message. But can we really trust a small group of people to make that distinction? Who is to say that they really ""get it"", to use a popular phrase? They are tempering with a carefully thought out and finished product. You could even go as far as to say that they are editing a work of art, something they are most likely not qualified to do. If it is altered, the new, crippled, product usually comes off as inferior to people who have seen both versions. It may even relay a different message to the audience.

So why don't the film company just refuse to let them show the altered movie? After all, copyright laws give them the right to do this. The reason, most frequently, is economical. If they refuse to let the film be edited they will lose the money the film would pull in from an entire country. Considering that companies spend many millions of dollars on the production of a film, they need the revenue. Not just to make up the costs, but also to fund further film production. They don't really have a choice but to succumb to the imposed censorship. In the light of this, many companies choose to do some sort of self-censoring to avoid the attention of the most fervent countries' censorship boards. They are actually forced to cripple their own product!

Admittedly there is of course some material that some people may find offensive. There always will be. A more detailed and informative rating system than the current one would probably resolve this issue. For example, not all countries have the 18+ rating (Sweden, for one), which might be suitable in some extreme cases. Until then, you don't have to see it if you don't want to. Viewing is optional.

This last point is important. Viewing is optional. If it somehow disturbs you, turn off the TV, or walk out of the theatre. There also is noone stopping you to find out what the film is about beforehand. Read the reviews! If you know you have a problem with nudity, avoid seeing it. Also, is censorship really what people want? An interesting experiment would be to offer the films in two formats; censored, and not censored. Which would you choose? I know which one I would choose.",0
178,2013.a2.txt,Shorter Hours: Just a Matter of Time,"""Once upon a time a Divine God came down to earth. He said to the people: 'You shall work eight hours a day. This is never to be changed.' And then he disappeared again.""
When you listen to the Swedish debate about shorter working-hours, you are sometimes inclined to believe that the opponents of this necessary reform actually hold the fairy-tale above as a truth. However, the eight-hour working-day was not a divine decision, but a political one which was a result of the nineteenth century's great changes in society. In fact, the eight-hour day is just the latest step in a long line of working-hour reforms, all of which have created better conditions for the people. So what could be more natural than to shorten the working-day even further? 
Shorter hours will first of all enable vast improvements concerning people's health. As we all know, the society of today puts a lot of pressure on its citizens. There is much evidence of that. A few examples: A lot of people suffer from different kinds of stress diseases, like gastritis, and a growing problem is burning out, especially among women with low-paid, stressful jobs. Some 250,000 people in Sweden take psychoactive drugs just to be able to cope with daily life. It must be clear to everyone that something has to be done about these alarming problems. Setting a new norm for working-hours is the easiest, the quickest, and the most effective means for that.
However, it is important to stress the fact that shortening of the working-day is not just a health concern for certain groups, but will lead to a better life for everyone. If we work less, we will have more time to spend with our family and our friends, and more time to take care of each other. Parents will have more time and energy to look after their children, which will eventually help preventing youth criminality and drug abuse in the future.
Shorter hours will also lead to better possibilities for equality between men and women. At present, both women and men generally work at least eight hours a day, which leaves very little time for domestic work. It turns out that in the end, it is usually the woman who takes the main responsibility at home, on top of her professional duties. If both the man and the woman worked less, they would more easily find ways to cooperate and to share home duties equally.
What about the costs of this reform, then? Opponents argue that the Swedish State won't be able to pay for it unless people's salaries are lowered together with their level of working-hours. And as they assume that most people will be reluctant to shorter hours if it implies lower salaries, they claim that the reform is unrealistic. But there are several mistakes in that argument. First of all, it might be that people don't want lower salaries, but most people would gladly accept less rise in pay, if it leads to better working conditions as a whole. Secondly, the finances of the State are much better today, in the year 2000, than they were ten years ago. Thirdly, recent studies have shown that even if there will be a certain initial cost for the State, so much benefit will result from this reform in the coming years, that we could on the contrary not afford to spare it.
A lot of countries have already begun the process of shortening the general working-day below the former eight-hour standard. For instance, France and Italy have fixed the new norm to 35 hours a week, that is, a seven-hour working-day. In Germany, metal industry has adopted the same norm, and there is a present discussion going on about the possibility of a 32-hour week. 
Inquiries show that a majority of the Swedish people already say yes to shorter working-hours. So why should Sweden refuse to join this sound development? No, of course it is just a matter of time before we step into the future and work less than today. It is about time to work less and live more!",0
179,2014.a2.txt,"Laboratory animals, an honourable object?","On a direct question, most people would answer that they don't like any kind of experiments with animals. If you argue against it, they look at you with disapproval and walk away, thinking what a terrible person I am.
In their minds they see poor, innocent animals in front of a crazy professor with a huge injection needle in his hand, ready to run through the skin. Of course, he does it only for his own satisfaction.
Myself, I do not agree with these people. I think it is necessary to have animals for drugs testing and helping us increase our knowledge of physiology and the way a body reacts to different treatments when it's still alive; in vivo.

Yesterday I was on the internet, trying to get some information about this very emotional and ethical issue. There were an abundance of homepages containing anti-animal-testing catchwords. For instance, you can easily find information where actions are planned to take place, etc. In Vaenersborg, the small city where I come from, a group of militant vegetarians organizes demonstrations, arsons and other kinds of destruction. Don't they understand that people can get hurt or worse, getting killed in their stupid attempts to convince people of their opinion. The way they use to put it, they fight for ""the animals' rights in society"".
I was on a very informative and interesting lecture here in Uppsala last year. The head vet of the university were speaking about different experiments and about the animals which are involved. He also told us about his own problems, concerning these matters as a scientist and human. He had got angry letters and threats to his home address. Sometimes he and his family were persecuted in different ways. He still gets a feeling that people dislike him, when he tells them about his work. 

Sometimes I hear people say that they don't like to tie their dog to a lamp-post in the street, in case it would be stolen and used in awful chemical experiments. They are so wrong! In Sweden, all animals for that purpose, are bred in special institutions. The scientists want to know the entire anamneses, before the tests begin. Otherwise, there are no way to make good comparisons between individuals.
The animals live in excellent environment. Well air-conditioned quarters (even better than in students lecture rooms), wholesome food and company. Social animals like dogs, have their own master for almost eight hours a day. I dare say this is much more time than many ordinary pets, which are home alone for a whole day while its family works. To say it simple, they must have a good life, so no stress hormones, heart rate, expiratory etc, affect their natural behaviour. In such case it would be impossible to see what really happens.
I've visited a breeding institution in Sweden and actually I was pleasantly surprised. Sweet little puppies, together with their mother and everywhere nice people who cuddled them. Even the mice seemed happy!

There are an ethical committee, whom you have to apply to before you get the right to use animals in scientific experiments. You only get permission if the committee doesn't consider it would lead to unnecessary suffering for the animals. As far as it's possible they prefer to use data-simulations and experiment on dead tissues instead. However, I just want to make it clear. Scientists aren't doing experiments for fun! And actually, there is a law against cruelty to animals even in the scientific world. The horrible pictures, you may have seen, aren't from any country in the EU and are probably old.

The opponents are quite short-sighted in many ways, I think. For example, when they come home with a terrible headache and without thinking any further they take an aspirin. How do they think it has been invented, if there hadn't been any testing of the effective substance at first? And the following day, when their sweet, little cosy pet get sick and they almost order the vet to find a cure immediately. Do they then want their pet to be the first one to try a new drug? Of course they won't, not, even when the vet says that he believes the chemical structure of the substance is ok. 

I checked on CFN's homepage (Centrala F√∂rs√∂ksdjursN√§mnden, the central laboratory-animals' committee in Sweden) that in 1998 the total amount of animal used for this purpose were around 300 000. That number shows all different species together. The largest group (fully 30%) was rats. And just to remember, many people use poison and traps for these ""noxious animals' in their homes, without thoughts of how they kill them. Dogs, cats and horses together only represented around 0,3 %. If we compare these data to that enormous account of treatments, including drugs, vaccinations and knowledge, we get in exchange, I don't understand how people can continue to be antagonists. Perhaps they are not capable to see the connection between the animals and the complete medicine. I rather hope it is a question of ignorance.

In the future maybe the knowledge of our physical functions might be so good that we don't need any further animal experiments. To reach that goal, we need all possibilities we can get. Nobody wants to be the first one to try a new substance. If we let the scientists make experiments on themselves, as some opponents suggest, the medical development would probably slow down pretty soon. It stands clear, we must have laboratory animals!",0
180,2015.a2.txt,Why believe in God?,"""In the beginning God created heaven and earth."" Genesis 1:1
These are the first words in the Bible. Christianity, our world's most widespread religion, circle around this statement. But what are the reasons for us to believe in these words? I will in this essay give three different arguments for Gods existence and according to them why it is logical for people of today to believe in God.
My first argument for Gods existence is an argument based on religious experience. Many individuals and groups have claimed religious experience so why should we not believe them. These people are what one might be called trustworthy citizens. We believe them when they testify in a court trial so why should we not believe them when they bear witness about an religious experience. The problem with this argument is that people also testify to have seen UFOs and other unnatural phenomenon's. But the sheer number of individuals who testify to have been subject to miracles and other religious experiences gives weight to the argument. It is highly unlikely that so many people all over the world should be wrong. But I have to admit the possibility that there might be an global mistake when it comes to this argument. Still the fact is - the number of believers give weight to the fact that there is good reason to believe in God. 
Cosmos - my second reason comes from the fact that we, our planet and the whole universe exist. The question that must be asked is: Why is there a universe? Everything inside the universe is depending on something else for the reason for its existence. For example - The reason for my existence is my mother and father, but what is the ultimate reason for my existence? It is not my mother and father because the reason for their existence is their parents and so on back trough history. So the answer to the question must be something else. If one accepts Darwin's teachings about the evolution of the species we will still in the end come to a point where we run out of reasons. One might then answer the question with Big Bang. But what was the reason for Big Bang? The answer has to be something outside our universe, a transcendental being - God.
My third argument for God's existence is what might be called a design argument. It takes its stand in the fact that our world is a marvel of orderly function. Everything inside our world is working in harmony with everything else. This argument is old and not a specific Christian argument from the beginning. It was first recorded of Xenophon in 390 BC when he quoted Socrates as saying ""With such signs of forethought in the design of living creatures, can you doubt they are the work of choice or design?"" The argument is fairly simple, the intricacies of our world are in them self proof for the fact that our world is a creation of a higher being. If one open a pocket watch and look inside one realise that this miracle of order just cannot exist out of pure chance there have to be a mind behind its construction. It is the same thing whit our world and all things inside of it. The answer to the question of who the designer is is therefor logical - God.
To conclude - I have in this essay given three arguments to why it is logical to believe in the existence of God. Two of them are what might be seen as more logical from a natural science point of view, but all three are in their own way logical. If the reader accepts my arguments or not depends on the readers own point of view. In the end the answer to the question if one believe in God or in God's existence is up to one and each to decide. It do not matter how many arguments that is put forward to why it is logical to believe in God or how much evidence that is behind the arguments, in the end it always is a question of personal belief.",0
181,2016.a2.txt,The students of today is the future!,"In this essay I will give my arguments for giving university students grants instead of loans to finance their education. Let us start with the obvious, it is not very encurishing to start your working career in debts. That put a lot of pressure on young people to start earning a lot of money on an early stadge of thire career, and with todays problem of great unemployment and economical difficulties, it is not surtain that they will get a well paid job right a way. This is very dangerous, becouse it make it more difficult for young people to have the currage to go on with their studies at high levels. Students are, alreaddy afraid of not manage their studies at university level, as everybody else they are scared of trying something they might fail to do, and adding the fear of gettig them selves in debts, make it difficult to take the step into university studies, which is of sutch importants when appaying for a well paid job.
An other reason why university students should be given grants instead of loans is that they might not afford (knowing that they later will be responsible to pay the money back) to loan enuogh money to be able to manage without working during the school semesters. If they were given a grant they wouldn't have to work during school semester and they would have a mutch better chance of doing well with their studies. An other reason why it is so important for students to feel that they have enough money is that thay are grown up now, and it is important for themto have a home of their own. As it is now students consider living with their parents, instead of taking loans to finans their own living. This is serious becouse the parents home is not always the best imviorment to study, and living by yourself is a great way of developing both independencey and socisl skills since you are more isolated you are forsed to meet people.) A student might even considering a school near the parents home, so that she/he can live at home during her/his time of university studies, and in doing so exlude all education at universities away from her/his home town. 
 A third reason, is that giving grants to univesity students would economicly benifit the government, throuh not having to administrate all paybacks from former university students who have been given loans (usally this a very outdraw prosess since you only pay back a small part of your oan on every payback ocation). Society would also save money in healt care, since the students would be happier and therefor be more healty. One might argue that students would take their education more lightly if they did not have to finance it by themselfs, but today university studies are extreamly important if you wish to get a well paid and stimulating job in the future, and this is only getting more and more important among young people Young people are studying for more and more years of their life, this mean that the period they are lending money is getting longer and the period they are making money is getting shorter. This is perfectly natural, since employers need more and more educated employees in todays society. But one should be aware of the importance of young peoples possibilities to cotinue their studies at a high level, and not scearing them of by putting them in debts befor they even have had a chance of making any money.
My edvice to politicas is to give students grants instead of loans to finans their university studies so that they: will have the currage to continue their studies at a high level, are able to consentrate on their school work, and to save government money. Students are the future, they are important, politic leaders can not neglect the future.",0
182,2017.a2.txt,Women - persons or objects?,"Attractive female bodies are being used everywhere to sell almost anything. Women are exposed half-naked in all kinds of comersials in order to sell items and services that has nothing to do with these women. This exposure of women's bodies results in many negative side effects. Women become more and more insecure about themselves. They degrade themselves. They will never become equal to men as long as we put up with this flaw in our culture which tell us: A women is solely a sex object.
Does it help help girls and women to talk about these matters in school and at home? Yes, it does, but in addition to that we need to make people aware of what this does to women and thus work for a restriction of exposure of women. Now I will present my arguments, namely women's suffering, that will give you all the reasons to take this matter seriously. 

Women are being exploited to such an extent that it makes them feel very insecure about themselves.Girls start to worry about their apperance when they are very young and put themselves on diets when they in fact are skinny as can be. Teenage girls suffer from aneroxia more than ever. When massive underwear campaignes are going on, with perfect half-naked women wherever you turn, the problems accelerate. Another effect that comes from women's insecurity is the fact that they have become more jealous and competative toward their own sex. The sexiest women are being miscredited by other women, because they get the attention from men that insecure women fight so hard for. A very serious outcome of our culture, where so much emphas is being put on good looks and youth, is that women have started having breast implants and plastic surgery. It is not only expensive but it is also dangerous. 

Being this insecure about themselves, many women tend to degrade themselves in order to attract men's attention. Music and magazines are being marketed by female bodies and in the movies most characters for women imply showing off their bodies and not so much their talent. The more women let themselves being exploited, the more men objectifies the opposite sex. When men are attracted to, or lust for, a woman she gets attention which does not really help her build her self-esteem, but it gives her some sort of worth. This sense of worth is very deluding. Since a woman, if caught in a bad circle like this, needs a constant refill of attention to feel good about herself, and since she lets other people decide her value for her she can never feel content.

It is a constant struggle for women to become equal to men.The enormous exposure on women as sex-objects makes this struggle even harder. Attractive women may get an employment easier, but on the other hand it is more difficult for them to climb the ladder in order to get a top position, as men objectifies attractive women and do not respect them. Other women disrespect them as well, because of envy, and seek to thwart more attractive women's plans to advance. Fat women and women that do not measure up to the ""normal"" looks, that is ""ugly"" women, are also being discriminated. As are men of course, but not to the same extent. Outside work, these women, and ordinary looking women finds it harder to meet a mate that will approve of them, since men emphafize on good looks more and more as a consequense of being surronded by perfect images of women all the time. Good looks and youth are no longer something to admire and enjoy but are the only qualities in a woman that really counts.

I have presented a few of all negative side effects that affects women in our ""youth and beauty"" culture. To sum up this arumentation I would like to stretch a few points. First of all, as every intelligent person will surely understand, women are caught in a trap, it will not be easy for them to free themselves. Secondly, they can not do it alone; society has to change its view on these matters. Therefore, it is important with information, starting early, at home and in school, but we also need to start a public debate concerning these issues.",0
183,2018.a2.txt,The right to bear tear gas,"Sweden is a leading land of woman's rights, yet women lack the self-confidence to go out for a walk after nightfall. Why is this so? Apart from the fact that there are even less law enforcement officers employed at the same time the crimes against women are on the increase. In a land that was once considered open and relatively free society women have become prisoners of there own homes. That is why I think it is so important for legalization of tear gas as a deterrent and self-defense mechanism against the increasing violent attacks against our sister, mothers and wives. It provides a sense of security, physical equality, and is a cost effective alternative.

Tear gas is more than personal protection; it gives women a sense of security and a feeling of control in their lives. In a recent survey conducted by one of Sweden's largest unions, Industriarbetarf√∂rbundet, women were asked if they felt safe going out after dark. The results were astounding, more than 70% of the women surveyed replied that they did not feel safe going out after dark and most of them surveyed said that they avoided going out after dark due to fear of attack. They were, asked if having some form of protection, such as a dog or tear gas, would make them more inclined to go outdoors after dark without company. Over 50% of those surveyed answered that they would feel more comfortable given some sort of protection. Many of the single women that were included in the survey gave protection as one of the reasons for having a dog. If tear gas were legal in Sweden many big city women would presumably choose to have a tear gas instead of a dog!

Tear gas gives women physical equality, women should have the possibility to be equal in strength to men. Men in general are physically stronger than women are, given a few exceptions. The legalization of tear gas would allow a woman to defend her self from a naturally physically stronger person. In Canada, where tear gas is legal, men and women carry tear gas when out walking or trekking in nature simply to prevent the attack from a grizzly bear or other types of wild animals. Should not the attackers of innocent city women be treated as animals? Then one can argue that the tear gas would also become available for the perpetrators as well. There is already illegal trade of tear gas and other self - defense weapons in Sweden today. The majority of people that deal in this type of trade are men; the large majority of them have criminal backgrounds. The perpetrators already have access to these types of weapons, why can't innocent women and elderly have them as well? There is not enough police force to make women feel safe on the streets today. The lack of police in our big cities makes the legalization of tear gas even more necessary. According to Leif GW Persson, professor in criminology at the University of Stockholm only 5% of all reports on physical abuse and assault result in convictions in court. 

Money is of major concern in many peoples' lives, not to say the least for single women. Tear gas is a cost effective alternative to purchasing a dog. Many women would like to buy a dog for security but simply can't afford the eventual cost that an animal can bring to the household. In the survey by Industriarbetarf√∂rbundet, another reason women did not get a dog was that they already felt like they were tied to their homes. Having a dog would mean even less freedom for them since they would have to walk, feed and keep it company. The legalization of tear gas would allow women access to the night as well as the day!

Tear gas does more than provide a sense of security, physical equality and cost-effective alternative it provides a choice, not to be a victim. These three reasons are just a few of the explanations, which are important to discuss in the argument of legalizing tear gas. These thoughts are not mine alone, but represent many of the women in our society. With tear gas women wouldn't have to learn ugly methods, or difficult maneuvers to defend off an attacker, such as eye scratching or kick to the genitals, which only the young and physically capable women can do. Violence doesn't beat violence; tear gas provides a chance to get away before becoming a victim.",0
184,2019.a2.txt,Respect Old- fashion or just common sense?,"What is about to happen in Swedish schools? All the respect between teachers and pupils seem to be long gone. Fewer want to become teachers and the situation is precarious. Pupils do not seem to care about anything. I think it is time that adults in this country and in our schools put an end to this. We need to show young people that respect and human kindness are important. The big question is how? I think we can learn something from Ivan Pavlov. He showed that positive attention in certain situations gave a better learning result. I know off course that he dealt with rats and dogs but I do not think the human brain is any different in that way. We need to make it worth while to put up a good act. My suggestion is that we reintroduce grades in order and behaviour. I believe that good behaviour is just as important as any other subject is.

I am well aware of the fact that this suggestion might seem old fashion to some people. I believe that we must look at all the things that are changing around us and ask our selves if everything really is worth changing? Are all the changes we have made in our society necessary and have anyone thought about the final result? There is no plan in all this; all we do is to keep up with the rest of the world without any idea of where we are heading. I believe that there are things worth saving and that is not what I would call old fashion. We must be able to evaluate the past and learn from our experiences. 

Many people who went to school thirty - fourty years ago remember it with mixed emotions. You hear them say ""in my days everybody could read and Wright when they graduated."" But at the same time they remember the fear many of them felt against teachers and principles. I would like to point out that these things do not have anything to do with my proposition. The school I would like to build is not a school built on fear but on mutual respect. I want to emphasise that I do not want the old school back as a hole I just want to pick out the best of it. Pupils must be able to oppress their opinions without being afraid and together I believe we can build a school like that where everybody feels safe and equal.

I know that it is hard to add a new subject to the curriculum but I think it would be worth it. A teacher spend a lot of time each day to tell her pupils to be quiet or to stop arguing with each other. If pupils knew this kind of behaviour lowered their grades it would probably reduce the time spent in talking about it and in that way there would be more effective teaching in the classrooms.

We all know how we would like our society and our schools to work. In a time with many changes around us it is extremely important to give young people a solid ground to stand on. If we teach them how to treat other people I believe we have given them the most important lesson we can. Even if it feels old fashion I think it is worth a try. We have taken behaviour as a grade away from our schools before and if it do not work we can always take it away again. It is time we stop wining and start acting.",0
185,2020.a2.txt,A nuclear phase-out is not of immediate,"Public discussions on nuclear power have carried on for a long time. Market researches show that many Swedish people prefer a nuclear phase-out today. Swedish government made a decision in 1980 that all nuclear power stations should become out of use in the year of 2010, provided that there are other alternative energy sources and that they are economic reasonable. As the situation is today it is substantially to know that there are no possibilities, practical or economical, to phase out the nuclear within ten years.

Background
Sweden has used nuclear power since 1968 and nowadays it provides nearly 50 per cent of the electrical energy and almost 15 per cent of the totally energy supply in the country. We are in other words very dependent on this energy source. 
Sweden started early with nuclear power and a reason was that our country had a lack of fossil sources such as oil and gas but had a large supply of uranium which is used as fuel in nuclear power stations. This entailed we cold avoid import duties.

Nuclear power is efficient
Uranium, which is the requirement of transformation of energy, is an ending resource but will probably last more than 200 years. This means that electricity production will have sufficient fuel for a long time. It is matter of course that we must think about the future and find other energy sources, but today we have few alternatives to the nuclear. 
Nuclear is actually harmless to the environment. It doesn't give any air pollution. It is a matter of fact inexpensive to run; there is no energiser that's giving so much electrical energy in the long run. 

Few alternative energy sources
The alternative energy productions are for instance windpower, fossil sources, waterpower and solar energy. The latter is maybe a future energy source but can't replace nuclear power today. Windpower stations are too inefficient in a windless country like Sweden, and they take to much place. A nuclear reactor (we have eleven reactors in Sweden) would have to be replaced by 1000 wind power stations! Oil and other fossil sources will be in short supply in the future. Besides that oil and natural gas give carbon dioxide pollution which rarefy the ozonosphere. Oil, gas and coal will certainly rise in prices and be even more expensive than today. 

Nuclear is safe
Many people believe that nuclear power stations are dangerous. Of course we can't be totally safe from future accidents but Sweden is very concerned about the safety and we have one of the safest nuclear power stations in the world. There have only been two accidents in the world and from those we have learnt a lot. There is a minimum risk that an accident would occur today.
The production of electrical energy gives nuclear waste. As a matter of fact this is not a big problem today. The waste is very safety kept in the bed-rock and within 30 to 40 years radioactivity has reduces by 90 per cent.

Nuclear power is still an efficient and inexpensive source of energy that we should retain. It is safe and gives no air pollution. People should have a second thought about this. In the future I am sure we will have good alternatives. But the nuclear phase out is not of immediate in many years.",0
186,2021.a2.txt,"Young, beautiful and successful: The superficial portrayal of women in the media","Western society is becoming more and more superficial. People, women especially, are more often judged by their physical appearance than by who they are. This affects women in many ways, none of which is positive. I believe the media, in their often stereotypical picturing of women, could be blamed for having a great part in this. Therefore I think the media should change their approach to how they show women. In this essay I will discuss how women are portrayed, which message this gives and the effects of it.

The potrayal of women in the media does not very much correspond to reality. The female characters in films and TV series, as well as the models shown in magazines, send out a distorted picture of the perfect woman. These people are supposed to be good role models, but the only characteristics they have in common are that they are all very skinny and very good-looking. Other qualities, such as intelligence, strength of character or kindness, do not seem as important. In the magazines the beautiful faces are accompanied by headlines about how to lose weight with the new diet, or how to make yourself more desireable with the latest fashion and make-up. It is very seldom that a plump girl or a mature woman, with wrinkles, are seen on the covers of these magazines. To make things worse, the pictures are retouched to make the models even more beautiful. Flaws, like wrinkles, moles or anything unwanted, are easily removed to make the perfect picture. If the top models are not good enough the way they are, how are the rest of us supposed to be? 

This message, of the importance of beauty, is very disturbing. By constantly giving advice on how to lose weight, what make-up to use or which exercises to do to get ""the perfect body"", the magazines are more or less saying: You are not good enough, you are not thin enough and you are not beautiful enough.Why this focus on looks? Why is it so important to be attractive? Women tend to say it is for their own sake, because it makes them feel good, and they probably believe this to be true. But the underlying reason why is because they think that is how the men want them. It is what the media tell them every day. I do recognize that there are a few newspapers, magazines and TV shows that have a better approach, but this is not nearly enough. The majority of the media still need to change their attitude towards women, because what they tell us today is that a woman needs be thin and beautiful. Only then can she find a man and be socially accepted, happy and successful. 

This distorted picture of women are having severe effects, especially among young and insecure girls. Not realizing that what they are pesented with are products, manufactured by the media, and not real people, they think they are expected to look like the models and the actresses. Not too long ago a junior school in Stockholm had to impose a ban on cosmetics; the seven-year-old girls kept turning up late for class, as they ""had to"" put on their make-up. Another already common problem is young girls going on diets, and starving themselves. Sadly enough illnesses like anorexia and bulimia are becoming more frequent, and are affecting younger and younger children. Older teenagers and women are also influenced, spending thousands of pounds on cosmetical surgery; breast enlargements, liposuction and facelifts. However, these operations seldom make very much difference on what is important: The feeling of not being good enough, which probably caused the desire to change the appearance, will still be there. I believe if the media showed a more diverse and less superficial picture of women, these problems would not be as common.

As the media have have so much influence on society, they also have a moral responsibility towards it. In presenting a stereotypical and superficial image of women, the media are giving the message that the physical appearance is what is important. This generates a feeling of inadequacy among many girls and women and creates many problems for them. The media can, and therefore should, change this by taking a different approach to how they portray women.",0
187,2022.a2.txt,Why do we have a Monarchy in Sweden? Doesn't it just cost a lot of money?,"Well, yes, it does cost money. Every Swedish citizen pays 4.50 Swedish Crowns every year for the upholding of the Royal Family. But a President with his/her staff also cost both in added bureaucratic and in salaries. There are many countries with only a representative President. The President would have the same tasks as our King, the only thing is the you Elect the President (yet another thing that cost money). And you really have to look beyond the cost in money. It's tradition, even more than tradition; it's our heritage. The Monarchy defines Svea Rike, The Royal Kingdom of Sweden. Without the Monarch, Sweden wouldn't exist as it is. It would be something completely else. It is deeply rooted in the Swedish mentality. 

Before the revision of the Swedish Constitution in 1974, Sweden had the next oldest Constitution. In accordance with the new constitution the Swedish Monarchs is:
¬§ The Chief of State
¬§ Chairman of Cabinet meetings in times of Government switches and informative meetings
¬§ Chairman of the Advisory council on foreign affairs
¬§ The Formal leader of all Defense forces
¬§ The one who accredit all Swedish and foreign diplomats in Sweden
These obligations would have to be taken over by a President and staff.

The Royal Family does serve a purpose, They are the Ambassadors of Sweden. They are our face to the world. The King represents Sweden by traveling around in the world, visiting other countries Heads of State. The King represents Sweden in many business deals, not so much as he does anything. He just makes things easier for the businessmen. The King and Queen are also present at big openings for foreign aid projects in the third world. And openings of hospitals and other charity work. The Swedish Queen has a special place in her heart for children. The Swedish King is very environmentally oriented, and is the guardian of many environment organizations. He was one off the initiative takers of the United Nations Environment Department. 

 The King holds audiences for foreign Ambassadors at the Royal Castle. It is one of the Kings many obligations. The Ambassadors will most likely get impressed by the splendor in an audience, and also be honored by it. You should keep in mind that very few countries are Democracies. Most countries have leaders that rule by other types of Government. They respect the Swedish King. All these representation is good for Sweden. We establish friendly relations with countries all over the world. We get a tremendous amount of goodwill. And that is good for Swedish import/export businesses. 

The Royal Family is well liked in Sweden. They are both down-to-earth people and royalties. There is always some friendly gossip about a member of the Royal Family. The older Princesses are held in high regard. People follow what they do in the tabloids and press. I was amazed by how popular the Princesses were. When I think of the Royal Family I think of the King, the Queen, the Crown princess, the Prince and the Princess. But older people follow the doings of the whole Royal Family. And that includes the old Prince's and Princesses. In a recent poll the Swedish Queen was the most liked and respected Royalty in the world. Number two is the British Mother Queen.

The main counter argument against a Democratic Monarchy is that it isn't Democratic to have a Hereditary Monarch. But as the Monarch doesn't have any political power I don't see what they are arguing about. I this current Monarchy the King try to keep his political opinions to himself and so he is apolitical. The problem with an elected President at this post would be that he/she would be a political person. And would therefore not represent the country in the best way. The Presidency is for short times and would fluctuate depending on public opinion. The King is always the King.",0
188,2023.a2.txt,"Many argue that the Conservative and Social Democratic parties should have had built a coalition in order to block the AFP from entering the government, but I think that's not the way to act in a democracy. I see the AFP as the Austrian people's revolt against old parties that have had the power for the last fifty years and in a democracy it is very important to respect election results and in the latest election the biggest winner was actually the AFP and ignoring this expression of discontent would have made, I think, the AFP even more popular and would've enabled them to continue their policy of populist soundbacks, while in government they have to take more responsibility for their comments because the party now represents Austria. Another thing is that it is easier for the other parties to counter the AFP when it has power and a position to think about, but it also gives the AFP a chance to show what they stand for and after this, are Europeans but especially Austrians entitled to draw conclusion of the AFP and not before the AFP got in power, a mistake that the EU made. It made it maybe because it's afraid that the same kind of development is also possible in other European countries.","I am going to argue that it's good to have the Austrian Freedom Party in the Austrian government and I am going to do it out of a democratic point of view because the AFP has been accused for being undemocratic. 

Listen to the people
My strongest argument for the AFP's right to be in government is that the election in Austria was free and democratic in every possible way and that the AFP became the second largest party with 26.9 percentage points and that's why I feel the party has every right to be in the government. One could argue that 73 per cent didn't vote for the party and that it shouldn't be in the government, but I feel that people holding this opinion forget two very important things about Austrian elections. First point is that it is very rare for a party to get more than fifty per cent of the votes which means that there is always going to be people whose voices are not heard. For the second, it is important to see where AFP's votes came from and one notices that it was mostly young, less educated men who voted for AFP, which means that the party managed to activate those who don't usually vote for any party and I see AFP's role in the government as an important sign for these people that it is possible to affect things in a democratic way, which I am going emphasize in the following chapters. 

AFP needs to show where it stands

Freedom of opinion
 I think that a democratic country has to have a freedom of opinions, no matter what they are because no one has the wisdom of what's right or wrong and I think that democratic parties have to have the capacity to counter ""dark forces"" with their democratic values, otherwise there is something very wrong in the democracy. Many have suggested that the AFP should be forbidden because it's undemocratic. I think it would be very undemocratic to forbid a party with the support of thirty per cent of the population, forbidding would only make the party even more popular, the popularity of the AFP is a sign of people's malaise. Different freedoms are democracy's biggest strength and its biggest weakness too, but it is impossible to have a democracy and consider forbidding something as illegal without proof.

Conclusion
My conclusion is that it is positive to have the AFP in the Austrian government and this because of three points. First if all, it's very good for the country to show that voting means something and that people actually can change things in a democratic way. Secondly it's a good because the AFP has to show where it stands and can't act irresponsibly without losing its support. Thirdly it shows that freedom of opinion means freedom of all opinions and not only those that might be politically correct, the AFP works as an alarm clock for all democracies in Europe that they have to fight against racism with democratic values.",0
189,2024.a2.txt,Why immigrants are a valuable resource in Swedish society,"We hear a lot of negative things about immigrants these days. Neo-nazis shout out their hatred towards them, and others, not quite as extreme, are simply dissatisfied with the politicians who work with immigration issues. A common opinion seems to be that there are to many immigrants in our society. We use terms like ""we and them"" and in some cases we only mention immigrants when problems are being discussed. Surely, the growing segregation in Swedish society is a big problem but let's put the problems aside for a while. Instead I would like to concentrate on the positive effects immigration has on our society. I hereby challenge the negative opinions about immigrants by stating that immigrants are a valuable resource in Swedish society. I believe that we should support integration and consider immigrants important contributors to Swedish culture. The following arguments will hopefully explain why I believe this.
I claim that our immigrants involve growth. They make us realize that our, perhaps cautious, Swedish way isn't the only way. They help us to look upon things in different perspectives, inviting us to be broadminded, or in some cases: narrowminded. We are forced to deal with the fact that the Swedish society isn't what it used to be, and this is a good thing. Immigrants put us to the test and make us examine ourselves. Some people find this change very frightening and try to hide from it. But I can assure you, the result is worth the effort. 
Immigrants also involve cultural diversity in society, which seems to be a very modern phenomenon, as well as a burning issue. Cultural diversity is exciting and I think it is great that it is being discussed so eagerly. Isn't it great with different people in a society? Wouldn't it be a terrible bore if everyone would look and behave the same? I think our white and cold country needs some colour. At least for me, it is very stimulating to be surrounded by people of different background, looks, colour, culture and experiences. It makes me happy and relieved. For example, I sometimes smell hot Indian curry from next door and now and then I hear the Muslims downstairs listening to Iranian music. And this makes me feel good, knowing that I have the right to play Swedish classical music on the piano late at night... Of course, I am aware of the problems that are caused by cultural diversity. I think a lot of these problems exist because of misunderstanding, ignorance and fear. Some Swedes often complain about immigrant's so called maladjustment as if it was our problem. Really, who suffers the most? The immigrants, I would say. 
One thing immigrants have brought to Sweden, which doesn't inflict any major problems, is their food. We have immigrants to thank for all the exotic food (and this is something, I'm sure, even neo-nazis would consider a good thing about certain immigrants) that we nowadays take for granted. We have the world just around the corner. We eat a lot of tacos, kebab, pesto and cous-cous but also traditional Swedish dishes. This mixture of different foods, and the possibility to eat them without travelling very far, is fantastic. I think foreign food culture make us aware of our own and perhaps add a little spice to it. This makes me wonder, do neo-nazis eat kebab? 
In my view, we should be proud of our immigrants. We should also be proud of ourselves for the fact that we offer our country to needy people. Some of us think it is natural to be helpful and show humanity, but as we know, humanity isn't to be taken for granted. Instead of ignoring people from different cultures, we should take the opportunity to get to know them. Immigrants need to be integrated in Swedish society in order to use it's services. Hopefully our own small worlds get a little bit larger and we will find that it is much easier, and more fun, to live if we accept and respect each other.",0
190,2026.a2.txt,A NEVER CEASING DEBATE,"An often-debated topic in Swedish schools, is capital punishment. Even thought this topic has been thoroughly discussed, concerning the aspects of moral, economic issues, and that it is cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment. I would like to highlight some other aspects. My opinion on the topic is neither black nor white, but somewhere in the greyarea. I hope to clear, why I am not sure of my position and one of the reasons, is surely:
An aspect that I have just recently heard of against the death penalty in the United States is that some states are discriminating on racial issues, which to me is scaring. Judges and attorneys, who are elected or appointed, they should be blind, like the statue of the judicial system claims to be, especially in a democratic country, which everyday claims not to judge by race, sex or religious beliefs. This does not only accrue in the US, but what is more frightening is, that a rich country like the United States of America cannot guarantee a fair trail. 
Another aspect of capital punishment is that of children, by that I mean humans under the age of 18 years old, who are sentenced to death. More than one hundred countries have laws specifically excluding the execution of child offenders. Although six countries have executed children in the 1990's. Among this countries are Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan, which are all ruled under Islamic laws, which means they follow the rules written down in the Qu'ran. There it does have a deterrent affect. I think you cannot compare these countries with for instant the USA! The States have executed ten children in the 1990's. I do not believe that a person of the age of eighteen years is mature. Therefore, I think if you are going to have the death penalty, you must not have it as a mandatory sentence. Should we not protect and help or treat children, who have committed a crime and give them a second chance? 
A third point of view is that almost half of all the countries in the world still have the death penalty in their lawframes, though not all of them use it. I would like to focus a bit on Thailand and Singapore. In 1996, the first execution took place in nine years in Thailand. This execution was supposed to set an example for other inmates, according to the Ministry of Interior. Scientific studies have consistently failed to prove that the death penalty deters crime more effectively than other punishments. Moreover, as for the deterrent affect in Thailand in 1996 120 people under sentence of death had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment in a Royal Pardon. However, this did not include people convicted of drug offences! On the contrary, Singapore has since 1994 executed well over 150 people for drug offences, including many foreigners. Despite the mandatory use of the death penalty for those convicted of drug trafficking, drug addiction has increased in Singapore. Drug addiction rose with 30 % between 1990 and 1993, according to Singapore's 5 rehab-clinics. According to, Amnesty International Singapore probably executes more people than the reported figures and that they do not get a fair trail before being executed. 
To summarize my essay I would say, I am basically against the death penalty, but when I try to put myself in to the context of me getting abuse or killed, or anyone close to me, I start to wonder if I wouldn't want that person to be executed? Just a few days ago, I discussed the death penalty with some friends. One of them was against it in every aspect, the other one was for the death penalty for serve crimes, which she categorized been serial killings, where a person had committed more than one murder. I do not believe that the death penalty is actually a penalty for these people, because I do not think they cherish life that much. However, in the subjective position I think if the offender was over 25 or so, I would probably think he deserves death, if he did not have any mitigating circumstances like a terrible childhood or mental illness. So I would say that I am for the death penalty, if we could have perfect circumstances and being 100% sure, through technical evidence. However the world will never be prefect, therefore I think we should abolish the death penalty and find a better solution.",0
191,2027.a2.txt,Monarchy demoralises everywhere it exists,"All people have equal value. Although practically everybody would agree on this, I think it is important to emphasize it. Democratic governmental systems based on everybody's equal value is actually the exception in the world today. Therefore - in Sweden, the exception - we should not sit back and relax. It is instead important that we carefully scrutinize our own society, for in the top of the country sits a man who has ""got his position from God"".
Indeed, the words ""from God"" rather makes you laugh than fills you with respect, but we cannot disregard the historical role the monarch has played. It is a role that symbolises tyranny, injustices, disrespect of human values and lack of civil rights - as far from democracy as you could possibly get... 
""All public power in Sweden proceeds from the people."" These are the words of the first paragraph of the Swedish form of government. It is the principle of political democracy, the principle on which we have built our modern Swedish society, the principle on which all laws concerning the public power's form and purpose are based. Despite this, there are still non-democratic remains in the Swedish constitution; the head of state is not elected, but actually inherits its official position. This is completely unacceptable in a democratic society - the highest official position and commission of trust in Sweden must, of course, be appointed in agreement with the above mentioned principle. 
Karl XVI Gustav, performs his job well, and this is the major reason why many Swedes want Sweden to remain a monarchy. But as I explained above, it is a matter of principles... It is extremely irrelevant whether the king performs his job well or poorly - the point is that the people have not had the opportunity to decide who should be the head of state. It is possible (if not likely, concerning the fact that the present king is popular) that, if the Swedish people had the possibility to choose whoever they wanted, we would still have Karl XVI Gustav as head of state - the difference lies in the principles, not the person. Another reason for changing the law concerning the appointment of our head of state is that, even though the present monarch might be sympathetic, we never know what kind of idiot who might succeed to the throne in the future...
Some people are of the opinion that the fact that the monarch is not political is a great advantage, and that another system, like an elected president, would make the head of state political. I agree - a change of system would indeed have this effect, but, as I see it, this is a positive, rather than a negative, consequence. Sweden needs a head of state who can take an active interest in the international problems - someone who not only holds pointless speeches and handles different ceremonies. We need someone who unites Swedish policies towards other countries and states. The question the Swedish people must ask themselves is: ""Do we really want our head of state not to be a political person, who only handles ceremonies and holds pointless speeches, without being able to contribute with something to the world politics dispite his/her outstanding position in Sweden?"". Everybody has political opinions, and not letting the monarch express his is insulting.
As I see it, it is, out of principle, extremely important to change the current form of government. The Swedish people must have the right to choose their own head of state. One problem remains, though; What on earth is the Swedish evening press going to write about, in lack of other subjects that, to the same extent, absorbs the Swedish people?",0
192,2030.a2.txt,HUMANITY BY LAW IN SWEDEN?,"Immigrants need faster answers regarding the possibilities for them to stay in Sweden.It takes to long before they get an answer to if they can stay in Sweden as it is today.
 
There have been immigrants who have lived in Sweden for five years before the authorities decide that they can't stay. That is not acceptable. We have to take a stand and make a law that limits the amount of time that the authorities get to make their decision. Such a law would make the lives of the immigrants much easier and reduce the amount of stress that uncertainty causes. They would also gain their self esteem back as they would be allowed to work again.Immigrants shouldn't have to stay in Sweden long enough to see it as their home before they get their answer from the authorities. It is better to find that you can't stay after only a few months than finding it out after several years in Sweden. 

Not knowing if you can stay in Sweden or not causes mental stress and suffrage. Some immigrants don't even have the strength to learn the Swedish language because they find that it is not worth the effort since they don't know what lies in their future and if they can stay or not. Many immigrants get depressed because of the uncertainty that they are living in. The fact that they often have gone through severe traumatically experiences due to war and other terrible circumstances, doesn't make it any easier on them. Ad to that the constant fear they have that one day, just as they are beginning to feel secure about getting to stay, someone comes knocking on their door to tell them that they have to go back to the hell which they barely managed to get away from years ago. They have tried to build a new life here in Sweden and now as that world falls apart too, who knows if they have the will or the strength to try again?

As for the Children, those who are young when they first come to Sweden or who wereborn here adapt our culture and our language. To send them away to the country they came from, after as long time in Sweden as most immigrants spend today, is not to send them Back to their home country, but to send them Away from their home country. Can you imagine what a psychological horror it must be for a parent to tell his/her child that you have to leave all of your friends, your school, your entire life to move to a country that you can't even remember? How do you explain that to a seven-year-old child? A law regarding time limits for the authorities to make their decision would prevent that kind of suffering. 

There are people who would argue that a law of this kind would make it hard for the authorities to investigate each case properly, others might argue that it will cost to much money, but we have to see to the humanity part of it. It is not human to let people wait for years only to tell them ""sorry, you can't stay"", and then force them to change country and culture again. It can't be accepted that it sometimes takes up to five years to find out if a certain immigrant's reasons to stay in Sweden qualifies as legit or not. We have to speed up the process and I think that the only way to do so is to make a law which shows that we won't tolerate the mental abuse that immigrants go through to day while waiting for an answer. I would also argue that a law of this kind will actually save money, since the immigrants who get to stay will get a working permit much faster, which means that they will start paying taxes and provide for themselves much sooner than they would otherwise. When it comes to those immigrants who won't be allowed to stay in Sweden, we will actually save money by making fast decisions there too. By making fast decisions we only have to support them for a few months instead of several years before we send them back to where they came from.

A time limiting law for the authorities will therefor benefit not only the immigrants'mental health and social life, it would also benefit Sweden's economy and future growth.This is why I feel that it is of extreme importance that we stipulate this law as soon as possible.",0
193,2031.a2.txt,FAMILY TIES: CHILDREN'S RIGHT TO LIVE IN GAY FAMILIES,"Through history people in most cultures have tried their best to deny the very existence of gay people and the possibility of those non-existing gay people having children were thus totally unimaginable. Today we know that homosexuality is simply a natural variation of the human species, something we can find in many other species too. However, far too many people choose to ignore science when it is at odds with their own prejudices and when it comes to gay couples having children this is more true than ever.
This issue is often made into a question of equality between gays and heterosexuals. I think we should instead focus on the best interest of the children. I find it hard to believe that people objecting to gays raising children base their opinion on anything but their own prejudice misconceptions of what homosexuality is about. For reasons I will state further on I am convinced that their misdirected goodwill causes great harm to the children they claim to protect.
Millions of children have no parents. They are left all alone and far too often they end up in the hands of strangers who use them cruelly as underpaid labour or even worse as prostitutes. With this in mind, I think it is preposterous that ""well-meaning"" people want to deprive these children the opportunity of getting a loving family and a chance of a good education just because their self-appointed benefactors, whom they have never met, says that their could-be parents are not fit to raise children just because they're gay. I can't possibly see why it would be better for a child to grow up in the gutter than be living in a good home with parents, gay or not, who love and provide for it.
Interestingly enough these people often base their standpoint on the idea that children in gay families will have a hard time in society because of other people's prejudices against their parents lifestyle. Isn't it strange that they are totally unable to identify themselves with the ones that are most likely to constitute this threat to the children? It's a simple fact that other children do not constitute any real threat in this respect. Numerous studies have been carried out both in the US and in the UK, and to some people's surprise it has not been possible to establish any scientific proof that children with gay parents are victimised more often than other children.
It is also important to note that when we pass legislation that deem some children to a life in poverty and oppression based on some dubious, and indeed also unscientific, idea that gay parents would only be a burden to them and wouldn't be able to provide them with anything better, we also show no concern whatsoever for all the children who are already living with gay parents.
When a society starts passing laws based on prejudice ideas we are in on very deep water. Legislation that doesn't allow gays to adopt children also has a negative effect for all the children, and there are many, who are already living in gay families. It breeds a notion that the love, care and security these children get from their parents aren't worth as much as if their parents were heterosexual. Sadly, this is in part true but simply because the legislation effectively neglects giving these children the same legal security as the children of heterosexual families. If the biological parent in a gay relationship dies, the partner has no legal right to get the custody of the child even if she/he has in reality been a parent to the child since its birth. A result of this it could very well be that a blood relative might step in and claim the child if the biological parent dies. This means that a child who have already lost one parent risks loosing its other parent with the full consent of the law. I fail to see how this could possibly be in the best interest of that particular child.
If we are to act in the best interest of the children we will have to put our own prejudices aside. There are thousands of good and decent people out there who wants nothing more than to give a child a loving home. There are others who just wants to be able to truthfully promise their children that they will always be there for them even if their biological parent should die.
It is not a human right to have children, but it is my firm conviction that it is the right of every single child to have good and loving parents, may the parents be hetero-, bi-, or homosexual.",0
194,2032.a2.txt,"The unemployment benefit system can't be particularly good when it makes work uneconomic. If you are offered equal or even better pay without working than if you were working who would not accept it and be grateful? The system should encourage people to find a new job and go back out to work, but that is not the case and the system is impudently misused. There are rules to limit this misuse, for example you have to look for a job all the time in order to be entitled to the benefit. Even so, that rule does not seem to work too good. People have to apply for jobs and they have to go to job interviews, but it is easy for them to make themselves not suited for the jobs if they want to by just giving an unsuitable image to employers. To require these people to do unpaid work in the public sector, to demand them to earn their benefit, would encourage them to seek and also to receive proper employment.","It is much too easy for unemployed people to get money from the state nowadays. I am sure that there are a lot of people who receive unemployment benefit by force of circumstances in our society, but I am convinced that there are even more people who remorselessly take advantage of this easy way to get money. In my opinion people receiving unemployment benefit should absolutely be required to do unpaid work in the public sector. It would partly prevent other social problems in society, partly it would make the unemployment benefit system more purposeful.
There is even ruder way to take advantage of the unemployment benefit system. There are people who sign up themselves as unemployed and at the same time they work on the side. In other words they get both the pay from the state and a wage for their jobs on the black market. To employ these abusers by public sector against the benefit would stop them working on the side.
High unemployment is reflected in many social problems in our society. There are a lot of drinking problems, mental deseases, domestic violence and other problems among unemployed people. The fact that work is so dominating factor in whole society also makes it an important part of our self-esteem. Unemployment is generally considered as something negative. Unemployed people, especially the long-term unemployed, are often afraid of imprinting, something that easily leads to self-accusation and depression. They feel that they are not good enough, that they are not competent -not worth a job. The longer people are unemployed the higher the thresold into working life will be. It is dangerous because a part of these people eventually fall outside of the society's solidarity. To offer these people work against the unemployment benefit would keep them in touch with working life and give them a feeling of belonging to society. In that way it would further prevent many of those social problems that we now are struggeling with.
It really is time to establish the workfare system and get all society's spongers out to work. It would put an end to the bold misuse of the unemployment benefit system and prevent the misuse in future. It would simply make the whole system more purposeful, focusing on encouraging people to get back to work. Above all the workfare system would reduce, and in future prevent, the great number of the various social problems resulted from the high unemployment. It would make many people, who now are living in constant anxiety, self-accusation and depression, to feel considerably better, and in that way contribute to whole society's well-being.",0
195,2034.a2.txt,Public health in danger - please don't reduce our PE lessons!,"The Department of Education in Sweden has suggested that the amount of PE lessons at school should be reduced. The arguments are that there is not enough money, and the money there is should be spent on the more important theoretical subjects. These points, however, seem quite odd to the fact that during the recent years, many alarming reports have told us that people in today's high-standard society get too little physical exercise. Due to this, fatness and heart diseases have increased, and general condition and health has worsened - even among young people. Below, I aim to pick out some points that must be considered before any cuts are made on the PE subject. 

First, it must be emphasised that we as human beings are made to activate ourselves. As children, we are out at play many hours a day. Then, suddenly, at the age of seven, we are required to sit still, concentrating, in a desk at school. And what happens? Children not used to long schooldays tend to get restless and unconcentrated if they cannot fulfil their needs of exercise. Of course, there are breaks, but is 15-20 minutes sufficient? Not all schoolyards can provide good opportunities to play; far too many only consist of dull pavement. The result is that many pupils sit still even during the breaks, and thus it is easy to see that the PE lessons are unvaluable times for physical exercise. 

Here I can mention an article I read about a week ago: In a school in southern Sweden, a plan is carried out in which the pupils have one hour of PE every single day. Though the schooldays are now 45 minutes longer, the teachers say that the children are more alert and concentrated now.1 Does not this show us that a reduction cannot be sufficiently justified?

However, one can never avoid the fact that there will always be pupils who really dislike sports in all forms, maybe especially at higher levels when sports often tend to become competitive and connected with performance anxiety - it is not a game any longer. There will probably be a number of students who will skip PE lessons if there are ""too many"" of these per week. But although the fact that many students do not put a great value in PE may seem like an argument for reducing the amount of hours, it is not. On the contrary, it is probably these students who need exercise more than others. The important thing is, as I see it, that there is time for activities, whatever the sort, during schooltime: a quick walk or a swim, for example. PE is important, but must not become a burden!

School must realise their great responsibility of young people's general health. There are many families that never come in contact with any sports activities or other physical exercise, and, if PE and health education is further reduced from the school schedules, where shall the children of such families get their understanding of the importance of good health from? Undoubtedly, school sports are a natural way of getting in contact with physical exercise, and this is getting even more important nowadays, when a great deal of the highly esteemed, prestige-filled occupations are to a large extent sedentary. People use their cars even if they only are travelling a short distance, and consequently, this mentality is many times transferred onto the children.

Furthermore, reports are showing us the increasing number of overweight people, and fatness can lead to heart diseases and reduced life length - all due to lesser exercise. This alarming development can only be stopped if we realise the need of a general understanding of health. And is it not just as important that school provides young people with that general understanding, as with general knowledge in subjects like language, social studies and science?

So what I would like to say is that although an understanding of different sports and general health issues such as smoking, alcohol and drugs (which are a part of basic education in Sweden) is not directly significant to an education in other subjects, it is still the school's responsibility to provide students with general knowledge at all levels. After all, people who are at school today are going to take care of tomorrow's society. And how are we supposed to be able to take care of our society if we cannot take care of ourselves?

196,2035.a2.txt,"I think that what I have said above says about everything what is necessary to say when it comes to the question of keeping the royal family or not. And I cannot see any reason to keep them. Our country needs to save all money that is possible to save. The work and the duties that our king has today could be made by a president instead, so why spend tax money on a royal family when it instead could help improving education or health care. Why keep capital tied-up in huge palaces when they could be sold and bring money to the state? My answer to the title is that, no, it is not defensible with monarchy and, no, we cannot afford it either. It is my opinion that we should consider how to get rid of the royal family as soon as possible to save money and the reputation of our country.","We live today in a country that claims to be a modern democracy, but still we seem to support the very conservative idea of having a royal family. This is something I feel very strongly about, since it has to do with the picture of us that we give to foreign countries. Do we really want it to consist of posh people running around in chic dresses at chic parties? But even more important, are we willing to pay with tax money for these parties or for Crown princess Victoria's going out evenings at fashionable Stureplan? Well, I am most certain about that I am not the only person in this country that do not wish to pay for such things.
I will not be surprised if some people get upset when reading thoughts similar to the introductory lines above, since I know that a lot of people care and look up to the royalties and, more strangely to me, see them as a natural part of our country's profile. However, it is a fact that our country is going through a rather tough period at the moment although recent studies keep telling us that economy is getting better and better. What we need to ask ourselves is the following: better compared to what? The present situation in certain areas in society are not good at all at the moment. Figures show that things are getting better, but real life tells us the contrary. Schools have to cut down their costs; there are more and more students in each class, there are more and more pupils per teacher. The teaching is getting worse since it cannot provide with the most basic material. The reason is said to be money. 
Statistics from heath care show us terrifying numbers; the queues to get proper care are enormous and the trend is going towards that each patient has to pay more and more of the care on his or her own. Although these facts seem to be obvious to everyone most people would probably say that: yes, of course I want to keep our Monarchy! It does not matter if the person being asked has two children in a school which the whole family agrees on is cutting far to much on expenses so that proper education cannot be offered. He or she may even be one of those nervously walking around waiting for heart surgery which cannot be offered because of the economic situation.
You may say that what I have mentioned above does not have to do with the royal family, but I would have to say that it does. If our country cannot afford proper education and health care for it's citizens then it seems rather strange to me that it is possible to support the royal family with tax money. You may also say that each citizen only pay about four Swedish kronor by the year to support the royal family, but I say that this is too much in hard times like this. I agree on that the four kronor are not a lot, but imagine what 4 times 8,6 million a year could do. It most certainly would make it possible to employ another doctor, another teacher, it would make it possible to buy material for hospitals and schools. Maybe this money could make all those general improvements possible that there is never money enough for making.
Schools and health care are two things that I, personally, feel could use the tax money a lot more than the royal family, but what about the actual function of the king. The King, as head of the state, could we do without him? My answer is yes, definitely. There are plenty of countries around the world that seem to get a long very well even if not being monarchies. A president could most certainly deal with the work that our king has today. The royal land areas and the royal residences could be sold and bring money to the state or transformed to other useful buildings for society, like libraries or reading-buildings for students.",0
197,2036.a2.txt,Compulsory work; solution for unemployed,"Sweden is today a country with almost 300 000 unemployed people, more than a tenth of which are young people between 18 and 24. This is a big problem of course and much effort has been put in to diminish these figures. The suggestion to make people who recieve unemployment benefit do work in the public sector is not something that would imediately contribute to this. It would rather be a way of lessen the damage that can come out of being unemployed for a long time and make the step back out in the working life a bit smaller. 

It seems to me that many people in Sweden today, especially young people, are taking advantage of the system of unemployment benefit. They find it easier to live on the government than to go out and find a job themselves. It is also the case that some people are officially unemployed and recieve benefit but work illegally without paying tax which gives a nice little income. If people have to work in order to get benefit they will be kept busy during the day and they won't get the same opportunity to work illegally at the same time. Some people might argue that they would feel taken advantage of and be used as free labour. But as it is now, who is using who? And why not look at it as a paid job. It shouldn't really matter who pays the wages, the company you work for or the government.

My mother is one of the people who have been working all their life, sometimes more than full time. At the end of last year she was between assignments for two months and decided to allow herself these two months of unemployment receiving benefit. Now, the very thought of her having to go out and do work in the public sector is of course ridiculous. This proposition should only apply to people who have been unemployed for a long time, for example a year. I think it is those people who are at risk of giving up and need to be reminded of what it is like to work and be out in society. So it should only be compulsory for long-term unemployed but everybody should be given this opportunity.

I myself have experienced some shorter periods of unemployment, not more than two months in a row though, and I know I would have appreciated having the possibility to do some kind of work. I find it very depressing not having anything to do. At first sight working in the public sector might not be that appealing. But in the long run I know I would have felt better doing something rather than just being at home all day.

This leads me over to the health aspect of this matter. Well, who says working is good for your mental or physical health considering stress, responsibility, injuries at work etc? It is a problem, but no one is really supposed to get injuries at work and mental problems because of stress, then the position itself is the problem so that is really not the issue here. What I want to point out is that it is better healthwise to get up and out and do something during the day. There are always exceptions of course but I think that in general people would agree that an active life is better than a passive, this latter which the life of an unemployed tends to become. 

The mental health aspect is even more important here. I've read somewhere that people that loose their job go through different stages. At first they might actually enjoy a bit of time off without any responsibilities when they can do whatever they like. They see it as only temporary and they apply for jobs with great confidence that they'll soon get one. But after a while they enter the stage of pessimism and they sort of give up and stop applying for jobs. Depression and loss of self confidence is common and some even take to alcohol and drugs and become very isolated from society. This is what obligatory working would prevent. People need responsibility and routines and to feel useful and needed.

Many aspects remain to be discussed and a great deal of questions need to be answered regarding the actual realization of this. I have here given my opinion as to why I think of it as a good idea. In general I think that if people recieving unemployment benefit, and having done so for a long time, have to go out and do unpaid work in the public sector it would be a good solution for everybody and I can only hope for such a proposal to be accepted in the future.
I realize of course that it's not so easy. Many questions remain to be answered concerning the actual genomf√∂randet of this. Where can they work? etc. And what good has ever come out of forcing anyone to do something?",0
198,2038.a2.txt,"THE FAMILY, NOT THE STATE, SHOULD DECIDE WHAT SCHOOL AND CHILD CARE THEIR CHILDREN ATTEND!","INTRODUCTION.

Sweden has a long history of centralised power, even since Gustav Vasa and the other autocratic kings into present times with our strong central government in Stockholm.. Surely the situation with the very long period of social democracy in governmental position prepared the ground for the comprehensive school system we have today. The intention of providing all pupils with an equal and good education caused the government to impose the comprehensive system in the 60's. The government's aim was not bad. They wished that more people should be able to attend further and higher education. Earlier that was impossible for a lot of persons. 
Since a more conservative government got the power in the 80's the uniformity of the situation has altered. We now have a totally different situation. I wish to discuss why it is absolutely essential that the parents and not the government have the power and right of decision about what school their children shall attend. The same arguments are valid about the importance of parental freedom to decide upon what kind of child care they prefer.

WHY, THEN, IS IT SO IMPORTANT THAT PARENTS CAN CHOOSE SCHOOL - AND CHOOSE ANOTHER SCHOOL THAN THE STATE SUPPLY?

First of all, it is a human right to choose school according to your religious or philosophical belief. This is clearly stated in the United Nation's declaration of human rights and also ratified by the Swedish state. The elementary schooling should also be free of charge, says the same declaration. 
But of course, this is not the only reason why it is so important to have a possibility to select. Another reason is that when people feel that they can affect this aspect of their childrens lives, they feel responsibility too. They feel urged to attend parents meeting at school and take a greater interest in their childrens schooling.

CAN'T THE FREEDOM TO SELECT A FREE SCHOOL CREATE A SEGREGATED SOCIETY?

This is a very interesting thought you often hear from opponents to free schools. Could it be that such schools would consist only of rich and successful people's children? And perhaps - a even worse thought - only of white people, no immigrants and their descendants?
No, I would say, whit the present system when the money follows the pupil every pupil has a chance to go to an independent school. When the money comes from the tax revenue, justice is maintained. It should NOT be a question of money if a parent wants to send his child to a non-state school.
The segregation in Sweden depends on housing policy. This is a greater problem for the state comprehensive schools since wealthier people just can move from a problem area while others just have to stay and have their children in a sometimes bad school - if they don't have a choice.

CAN'T THE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE ANOTHER SCHOOL IMPOVERISH THE STATE SCHOOLS?

This is a common question among defenders of state schools as the only alternative. I would say no, again. On the contrary, since competition will force the state schools to be better or at least as good as independent schools it will benefit the whole society. Monopoly has never been a good option.
In a initial stage an independent school could cause a small increase of the education costs in a local place, if the classes are very small. But too small schools do not get permission to start. An independent school usually gets 85 % of a state schools budget in Sweden. 

CONCLUSION. The main reason why parents should be able to choose schools for their children is that this is a human right and a part of the freedom a citizen should enjoy. But it also good if the parents get more involved in their children's schooling and if they feel they can choose, this is a consequence. The competition between state and independent schools will create better schools and it would be stupid to go back to the previous situation.",0
199,2039.a2.txt,Adoption for gay couples: towards an open-minded society,"Now that we have entered the 21st century, the situation for gay people has never been better, at least not in the Western World, as people, generally speaking, are more open-minded towards homosexuals. However, as soon as one problem seems to disappear, man immediately focuses on another, which ultimately creates ""problems of luxury"". Adoption for gay couples is one of these problems, and in this paper, I would like to discuss the pros and cons of this matter, by approaching the most common objections raised against this issue. The focus is here, quite naturally, entirely on the child, so I will discuss the problems of gender identification, sexual orientation, teasing and general problems of identity that may affect a child who is adopted by a gay couple.

The first remark that people usually make is that as two people of the same sex cannot conceive a child together, they should not be allowed to adopt children. That assertion is easily dismissed by the fact that adoption in itself, in most cases, would be useless if two people wanting to adopt a child could have one in a ""natural"" way. People then usually retort that the child will be confused about gender roles, as it will not have a mother and a father around, but two of either sort. A simple reminder of all the single parents who raise children should be enough to put an end to that myth. Gay people do have friends and relatives who have an effect on the child's perception of gender roles, and growing up with gay parents can actually help the child to get a more nuanced view of the traditional gender roles created by society.

Another myth concerning gay parents is that they would subconsciously influence the child to become a homosexual too. The fact that such remarks are made shows how little people know about homosexuality. People do not just become gay; it is a part of a person's identity, and most homosexuals say that they were born that way. Another good rejoinder is that if homosexuality depended on your parents' sexual orientation, there would be no such thing as gay people. Therefore, there is absolutely no indication that there would be a flood of homosexuals if gay couples were allowed to adopt children.
A more relevant problem is that of teasing, which can afflict the child when coming into contact with other children, mainly at school. Children can be cruel, and if somebody is different, he or she usually gets to hear at least some kind of remark about it. However, children who have got a negative view of people being different, in this case homosexuals, usually have got that view from somewhere, in most cases from their parents. If parents are open-minded enough to learn that homosexuality is not a bad thing, and to pass that on to their children, there should be no immediate problem when a child with gay parents starts going to school. Nevertheless, an important point to make is that gay parents have to take the first step by informing teachers and other parents of the situation, in order to avoid rumours and gossip that may occur if they try to conceal their life style to other people.

Lastly, it can be argued that adopted children have got enough battles to fight as it is, and that their having gay parents could only contribute to their confusion. It is true that adopted children, sooner or later, start thinking about their origin and about the fact that they were once, in some way, rejected by their biological parents. Sometimes the adoptive parents have to act as punchbags to their child's frustration, and the fact that they are gay can be seen as yet another way of complicating things for their child. However, I think we can all agree that people who adopt children do it partly in order to help a disadvantaged child, and not to cause trouble. If people do not accept children adopted by gay couples, the only ones who can change this are people in general. We have to start somewhere in order to have a more open-minded climate when it comes to homosexuality, and letting gay couples adopt children is one way of getting closer to that goal.

To sum up, I would like to stress that homosexuals are just as good parents as heterosexuals, and that they too can raise good citizens. Adoption always implies some kind of difficulties for the child, but these obstacles can be overcome if we all work together towards a more comprehensive and open-minded society.",0
200,2040.a2.txt,"Violent pornography, todays cause of moral panic","Moral panic is a Swedish expression. It can be defined as a contagious anger or fear that arises when something ""evil"" is considered so devastating that society is thretend and actions must come to re-establish social order. Classical issues that have caused moral panic in Sweden over this century are for example the books written by Nick Carter in 1908-1909, the dancing-floor misery in the 1930's and the video violence in 1980 (1). Debates that have touched upon the conseption of moral panic are aids, abortion, computer-games and rave-parties.

I will here give you my look upon the discussion going on today about violent pornography. Few people seem to have known that this excist in Sweden before a documentary were shown on the Gothemburg film festival on February 3:rd. The film gives examples of violent pornography that come in to Swedish homes by cabel-TV. Although the cabel-TV-networks are pointed out as guilty of agression on wimen, I think that this is a to simple explanation to a serious problem.

The pronography debate have arose from time to time during the years, and it is something that people often have an oppinion about. My belief is that pornografphy is something that is here to stay, and so has been for a long time. Today pornography is seen by both singles and couples as a source of excitement. If this weren't provided by Swedish magazines and cabel-TV the need would still be there, but the source seeked elswere. The advantage of having it through Swedish magazines and cabel-TV-distributers is that we have the possibility to maintain a good control. I think it is very important not to disregard this chanse.

A few yers ago it were a similar discussion going on about child-pornography. Thre was a long time of looking in to it in every possible way. In the end it led to a change of the law that now make it illegal to possess child-pornography. There is argued now that the law need to be changed this time as well. I think it is important to make an equally deep investigation this time. Althoug we have a law today that ought to make it possible to stop violent pornography, many critics argue that the law isn't working. Since it is so many feelings involved in discussions like this, I think it's important to shade off the discussion and step back and see if the law really needs to be changed, or if it's just the interpretation that needs to be looked upon.

When moral panic breaks out it is immediately demanded that a scapegoat shall be pointed out. This often lead to a superficial discussion that is dangerous because it reduces an important topic to feelings instead of facts. I hope that this discussion will go on and that all the facts will be looked upon to make it possible to make a change to prevent violent pornography in Sweden.

I would now like to come back to the statement I made in the beginning about that it is a simple solution to accuse violent pornography for all agression on wimen. These agressions are something very serious that needs to be prevented. It is possible that pornography plays a role in it, but I think it is so much more. If you have a solid belief in yourself, a social network and good models as you grow up, it is possible to seperate correct behavior from a destructive. Most people don't go out and pick a fight on a Saturday nigt just because they've just seen a violent movie, and you don't depravate wimen because you've seen a violent pornographic movie.

It is my deep belief that it is a profund human right to be spared from depravation, which is what the discussion about violent pornography in my oppinion comes down to. I hope that the discussion going on now will leed to a wider look upon what can be done about deprevation taking place every day, as well as a stop to the showing of violent pornography both in movies and magazines.

1)
Nick Carters novels were made scapegoat for that times youth violence wich led to that no one sold his books, but no change in the right of freedom of speach. The dancing-floor misery were seen as a threat to the youth since ""drinking and fucking"" were happening there, but the dancing-floors survived this attac. The debate about video violence arose very fast with the movie ""Chain saw massacer"" in 1980 and this led to a film- and video- censorship.",0
201,2041.a2.txt,Sweden - out of the EU,"Why did Sweden join the European Union in the first place? The answer is that a referendum was held in our country and the population voted in favour of the Union even though the result was almost 50/50. History tells us that all attempts to put people together with different ethnic backgrounds, different languages and religions, is a failure. My strong but negative standpoint against the EU is not only from an ideological point of view but also from a historical view. We should learn from history, but unfortunately it seems as if history is going to repeat itself. My opinion is that we should leave the union and I would like to bring to light the problems with the Union and to examine whether the Union is good for Europe or not. 

We should learn from the history. In the last years we have seen cruel and violent wars for independence in a few of our closest neighbour countries: Russia and Yugoslavia. These are two examples of countries with ethnic, religious and linguistic differences that could not live together. Everything ended up in chaos and a lot of people died a completely unnecessary death. We can just look at ourselves and our history. Sweden has dominated Finland and Norway for centuries and even though the history and customs are not so different each country wanted independence. I am of the opinion that the EU will end up in a disaster, some countries will not accept certain decisions made within the European parliament and withdraw their membership. 
  The romantic view of the European Union is the desire to create a peaceful and prosperous Europe among the 15 member countries. The true objective though, is to create a powerful military and political Union in order to be able to rule the world. Both the EU and EFTA were an attempt in the beginning to create a smooth system of transporting goods between the European countries. 

EFTA abolished the trade tariffs and supported a common agricultural cooperation and I am in favour to this kind of trade union. The difference between EFTA and the EU is that the European Union continues and continues to develop itself. EU tends to expand and wants more member countries, a common defence and a common monetary union. Today the EU account for 40 per cent of the world trade and I see a tendency of megalomania. The EU is not only a free-trade area, as the intention was in the beginning, but the fact is that the cost of the membership starts to retain each country's national rights and independence.
  Sweden is a small country. Europe has been involved in two World wars in the last century. Sweden has always been neutral and my opinion is that we should remain so. 
EU law is superior to Swedish law and, in certain matters that might be important for our country might not be biased for other member states such as Greece and Portugal. So who are we? Swedes? Europeans? In my opinion there will occur and identity crises among our population, and it is dangerous to loose that sense of not having your roots somewhere. We are not in the same situation as the United States of America.

At least they speak the same language, they built up their country together and they have a common history from their independence at the end of the eighteenth century. 
The European Union had a basic aim which I found quite reasonable but I am still very sceptical. I always look backwards when there is talk about the future, not because I am nostalgic but because we should study our history, on that basis we should make our decisions for the future. Today we do not know the outcome of the European Union but I hope it is positive of course. How it will come out and reach that aim, no one knows. The only thing I know is that the Union might be good for Europe in the short term, but in the long run it will end up in a disaster.",0
202,2042.a2.txt,NA,"Every woman should have the right to decide whether she should or should not follow through with her pregnancy. This is a right every country ought to afford their women citizens. But the truth is that not even countries that consider themselves to be well educated and free can offer their women the freedom of deciding about their own bodies. Abortions will be performed whether its legal or not and an abortion is a terrible experience for a woman. If it is legal one of the great difficulties will be reduced. Free abortion is also a right for the unborn child. Who would like to be born into a family were you are not wanted? Abortions should not be used as a birth control, but the woman by herself should have the right to determine whether she wants one or not. 
To illigalise abortions will not make them disappear. They will still be performed but they will involve much more danger for the woman. This is something some women has to endure in countries were abortions are forbidden. It also contains great danger for their lives. The illegal abortions are often performed in dirty environments with instruments that are not disinfected or even proper. One instrument that has been used and maybe still is, is the clothes hanger in steel wire. We do not need a very big imagination to understand that this instrument can cause big injuries inside the woman. Many of these women often get injuries that are going to make it impossible for them to give birth to children in the future. 
An abortion is not only a right for the woman, but it is also a right for the unborn child. The ones who are against the free right to abortions often claim that it is selfish of a woman to not follow through with her pregnancy. But sometimes it is more selfish to keep the child than to make an abortion. Everyone must keep in mind that it is after the pregnancy the difficult times start. To give birth to a child is a lifelong commitment. Minor aged girls are probably not going to provide a sufficient home for a child. Often they do not live with the father to the child; they mostly live with their own parents. Even if they live with their boyfriends, the risk is very high that the relationship will end when the baby is born, according to statistics. Of course the mental age can be higher than the physical age, but girls who do not have an education and a stable life, will probably not provide a sufficient life for a child. Girls below the age of eighteen is often still children themselves. Since an abortion is a very emotional experience they might think a little longer next time and be more careful.
There are other circumstances, which makes it inconvenient to give birth to a child. If a woman feels that her life is not in order or that she does not want a child at that moment of her life, then it is not right to the unborn child to not make an abortion. You do not have to be a minor to feel that you are not going to give the child a sufficient upbringing. A single, unemployed woman is probably not going to offer the unborn child a very good future. Many groups are against abortion and want the pregnant women to give birth to their children. But very few of these activists are willing to support single mothers or pressured parents. The interest for the unborn children seems to cool down as soon as they are born.
To legalise abortions makes them safer to the women and sometimes it is also a right for the unborn child to stay unborn. These are two good reasons to make abortion a right for every woman. Of course an abortion is not something that is going to be used as a birth control. Although, accidents can happen and if they do an abortion should be an offer for those who want it.",0
203,2044.a2.txt,"Racism, reserved for Nazis?","Racism is a problem in progress. But we do not call it racism today, mainly we call it ""hostility towards strangers"". All around Europe we see more and more of it. One reason is that the governments have chosen to take it out of the closet. The problem is being recognised. The holocaust and J√∂rg Haider for example. But is that it? What we are shown is not Mr. Average. We are allowed to see Nazis and wicked motorcycle-gangs such as Bandidos and Hells Angels. Do you have to be a Nazi to be a racist? What about the thousands of people who are ""hostile towards strangers"". People who blame all the bad things that happens on immigrants. Do they not count? I want to show that there is a small racist inside nearly all of us, we have to recognise him and through him out.
We all have our ways of seeing strange faces, some see them with hostility, others with curiosity. But nearly all of us judge the character by that face. Coloured people have generally a good idea about how non-coloured people are and why. Just as it works the other way around, yet most people do not see it this way. When a coloured person commits a crime, it is because he is foreign, and you automatically think about his background. When - God forbid - a Swedish person commits a crime it is because of society today. In the first scenario it is a bad person, in the second, it is a pitiful person. 
All of us tend to generalise when it comes to other groups of people, is that not racism? All Kosovo-Albanians are thieves, all Turks are subsidy-takers, Arabs oppress women, I could go on. I am not a racist, I know Ali ben Hassan. He is OK, I just do not like how the others behave. Do you recognise that? Most people say it and do not think anything of it. Still it is generalising and it is just as bad, it shows that you put people in groups and do not think of all people as equal and that is racism. 
Some religions put women back into the Middle Ages. We have religious freedom in Sweden, or is that just when you do not practise your religion? It is hard for young women in some religions to fit in, they have to be a saint at home and behave Swedish outside their homes. There is a big culture clash between the Muslim way of seeing girls and the Swedish way. Should you not in Rome, do as the Romans? Well this does not always work, when it comes to religion we have to learn to be more tolerant towards each other. For example Muslims - who are usually foreign - have to accept the way Swedish women dress and act. The Swedish people must show equal respect to Muslims. This sounds easy enough. But there is a lot of things that does not work. Swedish people think Muslim woman are oppressed and they try their hardest to fight for freedom on their behalf. Muslims suffer difficulties to appreciate something in their eyes so wrong as an unveiled woman. What we have to know is that Muslims do not see it as oppression to veil their women, they see it as protection. We are back to generalising and comparing with our own customs, thinking our way is the right way. 
So what do I make of this. Racism is not only reserved to the Nazis, nor towards any race, colour or religion. We are all in this together and the way to try to get out of it, is equal respect. To learn to understand each others cultures is a first step. If we can not try to live as a big family, at least we can try to be good neighbours and respect each other as individuals. Important is, do not be afraid just because someone does not look like you or talk like you. This is a problem you should be aware of especially in yourself. Last but not least, when your education is finished and you have become a teacher, do not be afraid to bring it up to discussion with your students and talk about it. Where else should you learn that we are all the same but different if not at school!",0
204,2045.a2.txt,Airbag vs. Krock-kudde,"I am probably not the first one to notice that Swedish is not what it used to be. Most people would agree that English has affected speakers of Swedish. What I am wondering is if people really have understood the extenuating effect the growing Anglicism have had on the Swedish language. In the last decades Sweden has experienced an invasion of the English language through music, television, film and the new information technology. In this paper I am going to draw your attention to what this invasion has done to the Swedish language. I will start with a few examples to support my following thesis about the risks I see. 

My first example of Anglicized features in Swedish has to do with morphology. In the Swedish language compound words are written together as one single word as opposed to English where they are usually written separately. Take for example the word, or rather the expression, standard language in English. A correct translation into Swedish would be, standardspr√•k. However, in many cases you find ""standard spr√•k"" (two separate words instead of one compound). This might seem like a minor problem because in this particular case it doesn't really change the meaning, it is more a question of orthography. However, there are cases where it does change the meaning of a word. For instance, one time I ran across stark √∂l1 written on a sign outside a restaurant. The natural way to interpret that is that stark (strong) is a modifier of the noun √∂l (beer) and not that it is the compound noun stark√∂l

Another linguistic field in which we also find evidence of a growing Anglicism is the syntax. I am thinking about the English apostrophe genitive. In both Swedish and English adding the letter s to the word forms the genitive. One important difference between the two languages that seems to have escaped a lot of Swedes is the fact that only English uses an apostrophe before adding s. As a result I often run across the English apostrophe variant in the Swedish language. This phenomenon is common in the naming of shops and restaurants for example, √Ösa's Salong och Berra's Sportfiske2.

The third example shows that also the Swedish lexicon has been affected. This trend probably started with the innocent occurrence of borrowing an English word in order to express some nonexistent term in the Swedish language. The growing computer language is an example of that. Swedish linguists have come up with translations to most of these terms but it has not resulted successful, since people don't use them. This phenomenon is not what is upsetting. After all, loan words are a very common feature in most languages. I am talking about the growing tendency of replacing useful Swedish words with English equivalences. There are tons of examples but I will just mention a few. The Swedish word Kaf√© is nowadays often replaced by the English corresponding word coffee shop and you don't hear anybody saying that they are going away to a kurort, instead it's spa nowadays. Another example is the English word airbag, which totally has replaced the Swedish equivalent Krock-kudde. In this case I even claim that the Swedish word is better, semantically speaking. Airbag is definitely more arbitrary than Krock-kudde3, which as oppose to airbag tells you exactly what it is. 

.Now that I have provided you with the evidence it is time to take a look at the risks with linguistic Anglicism. Naturally one could argue that changes like these are inevitable since languages are dynamical, but the danger I see is that Swedish seems to have lost the potential to develop independently from English. If we take a look at the last of the above examples we can draw the conclusion that speakers of Swedish has lost an important quality, namely creativity. To simply adapt new English words and ignore the possibility of a Swedish translation or an already existing Swedish equivalent word seems both lazy and negligent. The appalling result of this growing trend is that people nowadays state that Swedish is a poor language and that it hasn't got a large enough vocabulary. In fact, nothing could be more wrong. The Swedish vocabulary is not poorer than the average languages'; instead I would say that Swedish speakers that claim this have a poor knowledge of their own language. They simply aren't aware of the possibilities in Swedish. 

Doubtlessly Sweden lives in the shadow of our model English speaking countries. Not only do we copy the American lifestyle and share the weather with The British Isles, we are also abandoning our own language for their more prestigious one. Isn't it time we stop to think about the consequences of the growing usage of English? The native tongue could be said to be the soul of a people's national identity, if we eliminate that our nationality becomes crippled. Let us turn the attention towards the enormous potential the Swedish language possesses! Under the surface of anglicized words, expressions and structure lies a rich and useful idiom that suffers of undeserved poor reputation.

205,2046.a2.txt,Cut downs: The physical education is not seen as a high priority.,"In December 14 1993 the Swedish Parliament agreed on a new curriculum for both compulsory school and upper-secondary school. This included that the lessons in physical education would be largely reduced, from 537 to 460 hours during the whole compulsory school. Naturally the new proposal gave rise to many objections, according to an opinion poll, 83% were against the cut downs and 51% wanted an increase of the number of lessons in the physical education. Despite all objections the new regulation passed and it applies as from 1st July 1995, with a stronger focus on theory and health. In other words the new concept for the physical education stimulates the pupils to see a connection between lifestyle and physical activities, and make them realise how they can increase their qualifications to a good health. The new emphasis is great but it shouldn't have to compete with the practical activities. 

The politicians have to take their responsibility and give the school more capital and resources, so the school can give priority to the pupil's health and study results. Of course, all children have a great demand for motion and physical activities and since they spend a lot of time in school, the school has also an important role to provide for these needs. Therefore, the school should try to integrate the physical education (focusing on health) with other subjects to get the pupils to learn in a context. When it comes to the learning, children require physical activities to become aware of their body and learn how it works and also for personal development. For instance, research has shown that children who exercise regularly have a good knowledge in theoretical subjects and better study results, than physically inactive children. In other words, that makes that the other subjects in school would only benefit by more physical education, because exercise give the pupils more energy, better abilities to concentrate and make them more efficient in studying. 

The physical education in school, is for a large group of children, the only chance to exercise in today's society. In 1960s 80% of the children exercised more than once a week, while the number today has declined to 50%. In addition to this, many alarming reports also show that many children today are out of condition, have bad eating habits and are growing fat. The physical activities and sports have got competitors from more sedentary activities like television and computers. Another reason is, that all children haven't got the same qualifications to exercise in the spare time, mostly because of socio-economic differences. The children, who get the best conditions to take part in physical activities, have interested parents with access to money, car and time. That is why it's especially important that schools in areas with a large number of low-income families get extra support to teach the children the significance of a good health.

An investment in children's health today will become a great advantage in the future, both in an economical and a social perspective. Considering our comfortable way of living today and all sedentary activities, it's very important to educate the children and give them many opportunities to learn how to create a healthy life-style, which suits them the best. In the latter decade problems like anorexia, bulimia and doping have increased and to prevent that problems like these come up even more we have to start building up higher self-esteem and better health among the children. In the future this will result in both socially benefits and profits. When it comes to the social perspective, I think that most physical activities teach children to communicate and to build up a spirit of community, which result in healthy and positive people who enjoy life. Therefore, the costs for medical treatment and the number of absence due to illness will decrease and the profits can be invested in further health-projects. 

To sum up, the physical education is a necessary part for the children's development and an opportunity to movement and activities different from the common classroom lessons. In other words, it's very important that the school can provide the children good qualifications and make them see the importance of physical activities and a healthy lifestyle. Therefore, is integrating a perfect way to vary the education and mix physical activities within the other lessons. Unfortunately, research show that many children don't have the chance to exercise in their spare time and that overweight, bad eating habits and bad condition are getting more common among children, but hopefully this would be enough evidence to start realising the value of the physical education.",0
206,2047.a2.txt,The school in our time,"People in general have very different opinions about whether the private sector's be or not to be. I myself find it very appealing in some areas; especially when it comes to educational matters. It is a privileged resource that everyone should appreciate and give a warm welcome. Privatization in schools is essential to be able to attain student achievement, based upon their own motivation to learn and interest in their subjects. These schools have a curricula that presuppose from the childrens' needs and meet them at their level of development. There are a wider selection of subjects that demand a certain imaginative and creative mind; which challenge the children. Rewarding challenges that lead to good knowledge to use in the future to come.
You can always try to find flowing creativity, motivation and happiness in an unpleasant environment, but most certainly you will not find it. A lot of times this is unfortunately a fact when it comes to schools outside the private sector. You gather too many children in a much too small room, and call this a classroom. In this room the head of the class, that is the teacher, is trying his/her best to give the children a valuable education. And that is with far too few books, and other pedagogical material that children need to be able to receive knowledge. Comparing to this I should think the private alternative is evident. The classrooms are perhaps not larger but the number of children in the same class is not even close to the number of children in Public schools. When walking into a classroom in a private school you meet a motivation and creativity that is unfortunally not very common in Public schools. You can also be pleased with the fact that all children have their own new books, not old inherited ones. That is; when they need books. In many subjects in the private schools the children work with other materials, as in biology they use the nature as knowledge resource. Their facilities are more modern over all.Private schools do not just have more modern facilities, than Public scools; they also have more modern, and motivated teachers that are interested of the childrens'best. With modern teachers I mean that they a lot of times have attended further educational training. This makes them aware of new didactical and pedagogical knowledge. It is more rare to find teachers of the same educational experiences in Public schools; mainly because of the economical situation. Schools in the private sector are a lot of times sponsored by different kinds of companies; that are providing them with books, computers and other essential facilities. These schools therefor have more money to spend on their teachers'further educational training, and other necessities that makes them high-quality schools.
Mentioning high-quality scools brings me to think of the differing in grade scales, between Public schools and Private schools. The latter, see to that the childrens' personal qualities come to its right. Instead of Public schools, where the students receive a piece of paper with the letters: U, G, VG, MVG, the children get their grades described in detail. This means that either if you are a high-level student or a low-level student your personal qualities are shown and matter. This is an essential difference. The students put a lot of hard work and effort in their years of studying and should get shown valuable credit for it. This system demand a lot of the children which makes them more motivated and detemined to struggle to get through with good grades. People that are more positive to Public schools than to Schools in the private sector might use this utterance as a ""weapon"" against Private schools. They seem to be of the opinion that grades seem to be the most essential aim in these schools and they tend to dislike the demands Private schools have on the children. These schools do have demands on the children and they are aiming to get high-level students; but this is also what these children are going to meet in the ""real world"", outside the protected school.
If society wants well-educated, motivated, creative and ambitious students; Private schools are a good educational alternative. They provide the children with the best possible didactic and pedagogic models; to suit every student's needs and meet them at their level of development.",0
207,2048.a2.txt,Spice Up Your Vocabulary: Why Feminism Is Still An Important Word,"When The Spice Girls entered the public eye in 1997, they seemed to consider themselves as a new kind of definition of feminism, with their Girl Power slogans, high-kicks and pushy attitude. But despite the Spice Girls' increasing popularity, it seemed like their slogans didn't quite work. In the debate around the book ""Fittstim"" in 1999, it became clear that feminism was something that a surprising number of young people didn't want to be associated with. My aim with this essay is to explain why the term feminism still is so important, and why we should hold on to it. 

I have realised that feminism doesn't mean the same thing to everyone, and in order to avoid confusion, I'm going to give my own definition of the word: To me feminism has always meant equality, and nothing else. Equality and justice, and not ""Girl Power"" or matriarchy or any other form of female domination. In other words, basic humanitarian values that most people can relate to. But in that case, why not simply call it humanism? If equality and justice are the key-words, then why use a term that excludes half of the population, ie. men? 

The most obvious reason for this is that no other group in the world, be it blacks, homosexuals or different religious groups, have suffered from so much oppression and violence as women have. Fifty percent of the world population are women, and in almost all societies and cultures, since the beginning of time, women are or have been seen as weaker, less important and inferior to men. It is vital that we actually see things in this light, with the focus on women, to actually be able to change this reality. When it comes down to equality, it has always been a case of women wanting the same rights as men, and then by nature it becomes a women's movement, even though it concerenes men just as much. However, this doesn't mean that feminism is an excluding term. It is in everybody's interest that we get rid of the patriarchy, which is almost as opressing for men as it is for women, with its fixed roles of masculinity and strength. 

It can be argued that opression and unequality might exist, but not in the Western society of today, where the feminist movement in the 1960s made sure that women and men were given equal rights. But this is not entirely true, for many reasons. First of all, even if we were equal in Western society, that doesn't mean we should forget about the less fortunate women who are still living in opression in traditionally patriarchal societies. It is our responsibility to show that we care.

 But we also have to ask ourselves what we have actually achieved in our society in the terms of equality? Looking at statistics over domestic violence and rape, you start to realise that we've got a long way to go before we can talk about true equality, even in our society. Women still earn less than men in the same positions, and a glass-ceiling prevents women from getting top jobs in companies. The covered-up discriminiation is present in every level of society, and even though it might not be as obvious as in other cultures, we still live in a patriarchy. Now, more than ever, it is neccessary for feminism to become a part of society, and a part of peoples vocabulary. 

And even though the goals of the early feminist movement haven't yet been achieved by far, we have to be able to see what actually has happened, and to acknowledge the struggle that has lead us to where we are now. By bringing feminism into our speech and into our daily lives, we also pay tribute to the women and men who paved the way for our generations. We have to remember why the suffragettes chained themselves to the Houses of Parliament in the early 20th century; that less than one hundred years ago, the right to vote was reserved for men only.

Feminism is not a dead movement, and we mustn't let it die. There's still lots of work to be done, all over the world, and a way to start would be making feminism an accepted term. To convince people that it has nothing to do with the Spice Girls and Girl Power, or turning the world into a matricarcal dictatorship. Feminism means giving people the same opportunities and equal rights, and until these goals have been achieved, we can't afford to get rid of the word, let alone the movement.",0
208,2049.a2.txt,"What the politicians should do is place foreigners in different areas. Otherwise it won't be long until we have a hypersegregated Uppsala. It won't be long until Gottsunda is entitled ""little Mecca"".","Is the problem of racism really a product of the racist or is it a product of society?
Racists are a product of society's way of dealing with racism. It's not so strange that a person becomes a racist. Ignorance feeds prejudice. Prejudice feeds racism. But society is not doing anything to get rid of the root, ignorance. On the contrary, they are placing whites and coloured people further apart. Is this their way of solving the problem? 
In Uppsala there are four types of areas were we keep our so called ""scum"". Almost everyone that lives in one of these areas, Gottsunda, is either a foreigner or a person receiving social assistance. In some cases both.
Just a bit aside from Gottsunda is an area called Tomtebo, the most attractive area in all Uppsala, consisting of 100 percent whites. The children from these two areas go to the same school. But what the parents from Tomtebo have done is demanding that their children must be in the same class. 
This way of hidden racism is very common today. If the politicians keep placing people with foreign origin together we will never get rid of the problem of racism. Our foreigners will never learn the language properly and they will never learn the way of Swedish culture. 

A pre school child of foreign origin that lives in Gottsunda almost never know any Swedish when he or she starts kindergarten. A child that is ignorant of the language spoken soon becomes very distant from the other children. He or she is very likely to be left behind. 
This is one of the great problems of this community, the language ability. The parents themselves never learnt any Swedish so how should they be able to teach their children anything?
If you were to force these foreigners to learn the language when entering the country could you get around this problem? Well, this is already done to one extent today but it doesn't help.
Most of the people that live in these segregated areas don't want to learn any Swedish. They don't need to learn the language; they cope very well anyhow, because everyone else there understands them.
Almost everyone that lives in Gottsunda come from the same part of the world, the Middle East. They speak the same language, they have their own super markets and they almost never come in touch with the Swedish community.
By doing this you force the foreigners to take part of the Swedish community. It's more likely that the parents will learn Swedish and then the children will do so as well. 
Foreign hostility or as some say racism, often comes from not understanding and therefor be against it. By mixing the community further you could easily come to terms with that problem. If we understand one another and our differences it's more likely that we can learn to live in peace with each other.
But this is something that our local politicians will never do. They are too worried about what the voters will say. It's better to place ""all of them"" in these types of areas. It's almost as if they were doing this on purpose to get ""them"" out the way.

To celebrate our commemoration day or to sing our national anthem is nowadays classified as a racist act. How can you be a racist when you celebrate your country? I would say its patriotism. 
But because we have these segregated communities with their own cultures they don't bother to understand our culture and easily classify it as racism. If I was to migrate to the US for instance, I would most certainly celebrate ""4th of July"". Nothing strange about that is there?
But here in Sweden we can't do that anymore and the people with high self-confidence in this matter are in fact the racists or the new Nazis. They at least stand up for their believes in despite of them being used for the wrong purpose in this matter.
If Swedes were to take stronger participation in cultural and traditional holidays this problem wouldn't occur.

""You can't judge a book by its cover"". Well it is probably easy to do so if the book is standing in a section where you normally don't go looking for books. 
If the local politicians see the root of the problem of racism maybe we could stop it in time.
People are always afraid of what is different. Differences should be settled with words, not with fists. But if we can't understand our differences there is no way we can do this.
If foreigners learn more about the Swedish culture maybe Swedes eventually will learn more about foreign culture. One step in the right direction is moving us closer together, not moving us further apart.
Racism is all about prejudice. Prejudice is all about ignorance. 
If we learn more about each other the ignorance will stop and also the prejudice. Maybe racism eventually will.
But the kind of hidden racism that is going on in our community, by our local politicians, must first stop if we are ever going to find a way out of this problem.",0
209,2050.a2.txt,Affirmative Action: integrate society and helping minorities,"Every year a number of people from different countries receive residence permit in Sweden. In 1998 that figure were 39,433 persons. Out of this number some 7,000 received residence permit out of humanitarian reasons, they where refugees. Some 1,100 belonged to the UN quota - also refugees transferred from refugee camps the same year. Some 21,600 received residence permit out of relations reasons, they had family members already given residence permit. (The rest of the 39,433 were people from the EU/EES, adopted children, guest students and people coming to Sweden for labour-market reasons.) Most of the people mentioned above are people from non-industrialized countries. These people that in daily speech is referred to as immigrants are of course very diverse. Immigrants come to Sweden from all over the world, they come from different countries, different social classes and has had different education. Some are barely literate and some are very highly educated. People with high academic education, doctors, scientists etc find it hard, almost impossible to achieve the same position in Sweden as they had in their native country. A way of actively helping disadvantaged people like immigrants are through affirmative action. In the US where affirmative action is used, federal and state government workplaces has to fill a certain quota of employees from minority groups. This is preseded in the colleges and universities too, a certain number of the students has to come from minority groups. In Sweden if the state and local government would have to use affirmative action in its policies people would be helped to obtain positions they are qualified to, without necessary being the best-qualified applicant. 

Unemployment is not the biggest problem even though it is quite high. Statistic shows that out of all people with foreign membership 15.1% was unemployed during 1999, among people with foreign origin that number were 12.8%. The problem is that immigrants do not necessary get the occupation they are qualified for. Immigrants are fairly underrepresented in high academic professions for example within the medical profession, financial positions, scientific research etc. Although immigrants might have an academic degree and several years of work experience within their field they are most likely to end up at workplaces like restaurants, subway cleaners, street sweepers, cashier at supermarkets etc. These are of course Occupation society needs and there is nothing wrong in doing them. But if you have a masters in science or are a trained surgeon - does it not seem like a waste of opportunities both for the individual person and Sweden. With governmental proposition of affirmative action these people could be helped to actually get a position within the field they are trained in and most times well experienced. During the 90s most was blamed on the recession, even though it does not explain the ignorance immigrants often met, but things are slowly changing now with the recession declining. But it is to slow and not enough. If the government made a suggestion on affirmative action that went through immigrants in Sweden could get the help they need. 

Affirmative action would also be a way of decreasing the growing segregation in Sweden. Sweden is turning into a more segregated society not only with the raising gaps between the classes but also with growing racial segregated areas. This is showing in for example Stockholm with its growing segregated suburbs. Racial violence is increasing in both the capital and other big cities. Affirmative action could help people mix in a more comforting way.

Immigrants should not be seen as a burden, or only working class people. In order to benefit the most from the relation between Sweden and its immigrants we should let them into their own occupations. Affirmative action would help immigrants to achieve the positions they are qualified for. It would help integrating our society that is turning into a more and more segregated country. Out of Sweden's population there are about one million people with foreign origin. Either born and educated in other countries or born in Sweden with foreign origin parents. Sweden is a country that through its immigrants has become a society with great diversity, immigrants are a contribution to our society and should be treated as equals.",0
210,2055.a2.txt,Should it be against the law to be a Nazi?,"Hatred of foreigners (xenophobia) has always excisted. People have always been afraid of the unknown, afraid of people and things they do not know. One of the big dictatorships during the twentieth century was Nazi Germany which was most powerful during the second world war (1933-1945). During this time millions of people were persecuted and killed. Those who managed to escape from the Nazis and the horrors of the war tried to find a secure place in the world where they could feel safe from antisemitism. Nazism is nowadays considered by most people to be an upsetting ideology that led to horrible violations against minorities and people of different ethnic origin. However nazism has not always been the prime subject of discussion and it has not always been clearly visible, but during the past few years the discussions about rasism and antisemitism have again been raised due to the violence and threats made by the neonazis of our society. The latest debate has been about the question of whether or not nazi organisations and their activities can and should be forbidden. My opinion is that nazi organisations should not be forbidden since banning these organisations would mean that not everybody would be allowed to have an ideology, an opinion or views of one's own and that is one of the human rights. 

Everybody should have the right to their own opinion, conviction and belief and they should also have the right to express them, irrespective of nationality, colour of the skin and religion. To ban an organisation would mean banning all their activities, such as demonstrations, meetings, concerts, distribution of music, magazines and information and thereby also the ability to express opinions. This would be a threat to democracy and human rights since we believe that everyone has the right to demonstrate and state one's opinion as long as one does not brake any laws by using force or offending anyone. According to our laws nobody is allowed to violate other peoples rights, and even if rasists have horrible views, they still have the same rights as long as they do not commit any crimes. Valid legislation must be used and interpreted so that society, people and their rights are protected. Legislation is for protection and therefore I believe that we should have a strict policy and not be afraid of using laws. These laws should protect everyone, except the criminals. Instead of banning the organisations and their activities it is up to all of us to show that nazism and antisemitism is not acceptable. Everybody has to follow the rules that are set up by society and the people in it. We all have the choice to listen to or to dissociate from nazi propaganda and information is the only way to enlighten people. Communication between ""us"" and ""them"", together with teaching history are tools for reducing xenophobia. 

If the organisations were to be banned there would be a big risk that they would go underground. They would grow under the surface. They would find ways to spread their ideology in illegal ways and authorities would not have any kind of control over them. Banning organisations does not make the problem of xenophobia and rasism disappear. 

Is banning nazi organisations the best solution for the society? I do not think so. If we use the argument that these organisations are not democratic we must remember that neither are we, if we prevent a particular organisation from expressing their opinion. Who gives us the right to decide which groups have the right to give their view. Even if these views can be horrible and disgusting, you still should have the right to state them. I become angry and frustrated when I hear nazi propaganda, but I still think they have the right to think and feel any way they want.
If we were to decide that extreme nationalsocialism is forbidden, the next question would be: Are there any more groups that do not agree with ""our"" views? 

In conclusion I believe that these arguments are reasons enough for allowing any groups of people to gather and think/discuss/propagate their opinion, even if this opinion disagrees with that of the majority.",0
211,2056.a2.txt,"ENGLISH, WHEN IS THE RIGHT TIME?","In what grade should Swedish students be introduced to English? That is right now a big issue. Everyone have different opinions about what is best. Some think it is better to start with English as early as in first grade, while many people still think that fourth grade is the best time to start. There are of course many, more or less, good arguments for both alternatives.
An argument against English in first grade is that it might be confusing for the students with too many new subjects. They should have a chance to learn Swedish before they start with a foreign language. An answer to that is that English is not as new to the students now as it may have been before. In the society we live in today, we get a lot of influences from English speaking countries, mainly America. The students have probably met English earlier, either on vacations or on TV and in music. Even if they do not know what everything means they have heard the sound of the language. Probably most children know how to count and say a few sentences too. It could be something they have heard in a song.
You can start on different levels depending on which grade you start with English. If you start in first grade, it of course will be impossible to read texts while many students can not read in Swedish yet. That does not mean that I think it is better to start later with English. Students learn easier, the younger they are. Even in first grade you can bring in English in other subjects. If you talk about the different seasons or animals, the students often want to learn those words in English. Reading and writing in English is easier to learn if you already now the meaning of the words and how they are pronounced. Also I think it is more motivated for everyone to feel that they can use the language in speaking rather than reading and writing in the beginning. 
When I went to school, we started with English in third grade. My sister started school two years later, and than they tried to start with English in first grade. It did not work at all, but I do not think it had to do with anything else but the teacher. If the teacher does not believe in an early start, he/she probably will have a hard time motivating the children. They had to start over in third grade again.
When starting with a foreign language, in this case English, with small children it is good to start playing with it. Rimes and songs, which are easy to remember, are a good start. The children probably will say the words awkwardly, but still it is an easy way for them to remember. The teacher just will have to be extra clear on those words. Pictures are good to bring in to the classroom as well. The children can try to explain them to each other. I also think it is important to start with short sessions of English, maybe 20 minutes each time. A lot of repeating, not new things every time will help the children not to loose their patience.
As you can see, I am positive for starting with English as early as possible. I think it is good because most students at that age will be interested in English. It is better to start before many children starts to act out thinking everything is boring as they often do in fourth and fifth grade. Then it is cool to hate school and skipping homework. The main thing is of course what the teacher believes in. If the teacher do not think it is good to start too early, he/she probably will not be as good as a teacher as one who believes in an early start.",0
212,2057.a2.txt,EDUCATION MUST BE PROFITABLE,"When I first was about to decide whether I was going to become a teacher or not, I started wondering whether it was profitable enough to make a living or not. I tried to weigh the pros and cons forth and back until I realized that I would go for this low-paid profession and hope that the wages for teachers would grow higher during my time of education.
It is very important that teachers get a higher wage especially to improve the status of the profession and also to raise the quality of the teachers which is of great significance. These things would lead to an attractive education which definitely would attract merely the best suited persons for it. An attractive education is of course what also could be needed to improve the Swedish schools and since the wages for Swedish teachers are the lowest in Europe they definitely need to be raised. This is something that the Swedish Government authorities should take into consideration if they really want to incourage people to become teachers, which is a kind of ""dying"" profession nowadays. I mean by this that we are short on teachers in Sweden at the moment. Raising the wages would make teachers to think twice before dropping out.
To prevent teachers from dropping out to more attractive professions, above all regarded to the wages, the teachers wages must be able to compete with these. Compared to a Master of Engineering or even a dentist, who has as long time of education as a secondary school teacher has, the teachers wage is way to low in comparison to the importance of this profession, the length of the education and to its demands. As a working person in any profession you really need to feel that you are doing something that is worth the effort. That is why it is so important to place the teachers wages on a level with all other important professions. What if nobody wanted to become a teacher because of this low-paid profession? How would anyone get a good education then? First of all it is quite clear that if you want to get a good or well-paid job, you have got to get a good education and high grades. And second of all I know from my own experience of school that it is much easier to keep the information that you get in school if you have a well-educated teacher that really feel happy about his or her job. The teacher must enjoy what he or she is doing and like to teach others what he or she feels is important to learn. Education really needs to be profitable and this is why the wages must be raised in comparison to the length of education and to the knowledge that the teachers possess. 
We can also see this in the spread of the wages in the teaching-profession today which is not wide enough. There are lots of secondary school teachers who hardly have any higher wages than preschool teachers. And this I think also should be compared to the different lenghts of educations, since secondary school teachers in fact read a year and a half longer than preschool teachers. Even the demands of the preschool education is quite different to the demands of secondary school education. The books of different levels that the two various educations use is just one example of that, in fact the degree of difficulty on the whole differs.
As a conclusion to this I would like to say that we cannot do without teachers in todays society. It wouldn't get you anywhere, so for the survival of knowledge education must be profitable.",0
213,2058.a2.txt,Girl power - teenage feminism as a misguiding trend,"""Feminism - the belief that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men"", that is what Longman Dictionary says. But the ""girl power"" of today is a mass-trend that might cause more damage than improvement for the young girls that now call themselves feminists. Most of them are teenagers still in school and have hardly been victimized by injustices in questions of wages and positions, if those still exist. Being a feminist today is more about erasing the fact that we are all unique individuals with the right to think and act freely.
To grow up and figure out who you are is not an easy task. The only way of succeeding is by carbon copy other people's thoughts and opinions onto yourself and name it You. The importance is though to sort between a wide range of options, to become your own version of these thoughts. Being a feminist is a way of labeling your identity. But being a trend feminist is not about being someone, but being a part of something. The safety of belonging to a group. The security of being part of a body where there is no longer focus on the individual human being, but on the unit and its opinions. 
For someone ""on the outside"" the fact that men and women should be paid equally is simply common sense, and nothing that needs to be labeled by a teenage movement. But women will never have penises and men will never give birth. Have the fact that we can be equal, but never alike, totally passed these young girls by? Women have qualities men probably never will get, and vice versa. There is nothing bad in yearning to take care, wanting to give birth and staying at home. But simple mathematics tells that different input will generate different output. Overall statistics will show that female wages are lower as long as in a lifetime birthgiving women do not work as much as men. It might seem like the present wave of feminism wants to have what men have got. Is then the conclusion that you as a woman is weak if you feel dependant and a good woman is the one who gives up her blessing to be alike? 
The present trend feminism seems to have shifted from the fight for ""same rights and opportunities"" more towards being an identity and the judgement other people. Throughout the entire life one has different idols, or people you look up to for achieving something great. The teenagers of today often idolize musicians, and if there would not have been for Spice Girls there would probably not have been any teenaged feminists either. Along with the artificial group of five styled British girls and their ""girl power"" came other young female artists. Aiming at the same target group ( preferably pre-teenagers), conveniently they as well labeled themselves feminists. Robyn for example, who is a big star in Sweden as well as in the rest of the world, is one of those. A feminist, she says, judging women who show their breasts in men's magazines. Then, before releasing her second album, she uncovers her story about having an abortion. What signals does she send out to her fans? That they have the right to think less of someone else? That killing is more acceptable than nudity? 
Abortion used to be one of the main issues of the original feminism movement. Today abortion is legal in Sweden and the woman's choice up until the 12th week of pregnancy. Women's right to vote used to be another subject. Nowadays women are allowed to vote as long as they are over 18 years old and Swedish citizens, the same as for men. So there is no immediate need to demonstrate these opinions in public. Still ""girl power"" somehow is telling young girls of today that they are discriminated, that they have to fight for their rights. 
The present trend feminism might undermine the aims and achievements made by the original feminism movement, that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men. Hiding in a group, the importance of making up your own mind in order to be unique seems to be long lost. Still the fact remains: No one will make it completely on their own. Even as strong individuals we are all dependant on one another. Today there is no need to be a feminist, but to be a decent human being and to make ends meet.",0
214,2059.a2.txt,It's time to stop cuts in school budgets,"During the past few years Swedish schools have suffered severe cuts in their budgets. These cuts affect all levels of education from pre-school to university. They will, if nothing is done, create a future crises not only in the Swedish educational system but also in the entire society. Swedish citizens will be known worldwide as underachievers, and the Swedish hi-tech √øindustry, at present rated to be among the most innovative in the world, will fall hopelessly behind other countries that have realized the importance of maintaining a high school quality. In fact, the policy of money spending should be the opposite. More resources is actually needed to create a school system, that can compete with the best educational systems in other countries, and produce the next generation of qualified manpower in all different areas of society.

The pupils of today, as mentioned abov √øe, need better education in order to get a qualified job. It is not enough to finish upper secondary school with average grades anymore. Nowadays a university education is needed to get any job at all. Recent statistics from the department of education reveal that about ten percent of the Swedish pupils fail in the three major subjects, Swedish, English and Mathematics in the nineth grade. This alarming fact is something our elected polititians must consider when determining the amount of money to be spent on schools in the next budget.

Why do Swedish pupils suddenly fail at this alarming rate? There are of course several reasons, but in my mind they are all related to tighter school budgets. Firstly, the number of pupils in each class have increased. This makes it difficult for the teacher to give attention to every single pupil in the classroom. The weaker pupils will suffer and the brighter ones are in danger of losing interest. Secondly, there is not enough money to buy a sufficiant amount of school bo oks. Pupils are not alloved to bring books at home to study. They have to read them at school. School libraries have also been shut down in many schools due to the fact that there is money to be saved on librarians salaries. Some people argue that investing in computers connected to the Internet will make up for the lack of books. This is true, to a certain extent, but there are dangerous sides to this. Teachers do encourage pupils to use the Internet in their search for facts on different topics, but tend to forget to inform them about being critical of the accuracy of the facts they find. I have seen this happen several times at my childrens schools. (They are presently in the fourth and seventh grades). Thirdly, there is a huge number of unqualified teachers w orking in school today. They do not have the pedagogical skills pupils have the right to expect. In order to attract more people to become teachers it is nessesary to boost the status of the profession. This is easily done by paying the teachers higher salaries. 

One disturbing fact is a growing health problem among teachers. Normally, schools have a much smaller staff nowadays than ever before. Professions as school psychologists, secretaries, caretakers and librarians no longer seem to exist at school. Teachers have to do all their work now, as well as teaching. The result of this is overworked teachers burning themselves out and they are therefore unable to work. It has become very common that teachers have to be on long sick-leaves.

Taken all the obove menti √ßoned facts into consideration, the result can only be that it is time to start spending money on education. I am convinced that reversing the saving process that has been going on for the past few years is absolutly nessesery. The saving that is done today will prove extremly costly in the long run, in terms of high costs in unemployment benefits. If more money is to be spent on education, Sweden and it's citizens will gain tremendously and save lots of money in the long run. Highly qualified, well-paid and happy teachers with the sufficient pedgogical material, will be able to motivate pupils in their learning process and thereby helping them into a world of possibilities. Remember that knowledge is not a heavy burden to bear.",0
215,2060.a2.txt,THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUTING,"Even though we all know how important nature is to us, and for other living creatures, we tend to ignore that because of our own laziness. It is a shame to see all this people sitting in their cars, alone, in a traffic jam and pollution lies like a blanket of the sky. If we do not take care of Mother Nature, who will? And a good way to help is by travelling together. There are so many reasons to why commuting is a much better alternative than travelling by car for example. I have chosen to bring out some of them, to convince you that I am right. 

Firstly, one of the reasons that commuting is cheaper is that you do not have to pay parking fees. In cities these fees are expensive and if you also add the petrol costs and maintenance you get away very cheap by commuting. If you leave your car at home you also avoid putting other people in a position that might be dangerous. Due to the fact that the number of accidents are closely related to the number of vehicles on the road, a safe and strong recommendation should be to travel together with other people. Another aspect of why it saves you money is all the exercise you get for free. In other words, the expense for a gym-card is not necessary. As I mentioned earlier, if more people would commute, we will get less pollution and you will then breath more fresh air, when you walk between two bus stops.

Secondly, the foremost reason, except that it is cheaper, and saves the nature, travel together with other people, is the great chance to socialise. In stead of clutching the wheel tight, half listening to the radio Stockholm, you hear, for example on the bus, get the opportunity to talking with others about this and that. However, sometimes you step upon people with a strange attitude, and maybe you get a little bit annoyed but in the end, they always makes you laugh and that is really what life is all about. To have a good laugh and meet all kinds of people.

Finally, it is important to bring out how much you develop as a person, thanks to all the books and music you have time to explore when you travel. To start the day with a exciting novel on your way to work instead of being stuck in a traffic jam, that, I would say is a nice beginning of the day. Suddenly you might find yourself in the middle of the jungle with all sorts of different animals, or perhaps you are out in the sea on a big boat just floating around, having a life experience, who knows? When you commute, all this is possible, just use your imagination, and explore the world of the novels, and music. 

In other words, travelling together with other people makes you develop as a human being. This is done by all the intellectual work you get to process. I also want to underline the social experience. The commuters are friendly, with some exceptions that I mentioned earlier, and one must always take the chance to talking with others. However, the greatest reason for commuting is to saving Mother Nature. There are of course other things that effects pollution, but exhaust fumes are one of the largest source to increasing it. By now you have probably realised what I am pointing out, that is, the importance of commuting. As you all can see, there are really no other options, in a modern society as we live in, than to co-operate and travel together.",0
216,2061.a2.txt,Elders in the families?,"Is it possible to move the responsiblity of care for the eldery from the state onto the family? What would such a reorganization mean? What are the advantages and disadvanatges? 

Taking care of old people, especially old people over a certain age, requires a lot of hard work. My sister has been working in a home for old people for a lot of years during her summer holidays, so I know from her experience that the case is really so. Old people in bad condition needs attention more or less 24 hours a day. Moreover, I have a grandmother who is 92 years old and who is living in a home for old people. Even though she is entirely taken care of by the personnel in the home, my mother has to run some errands for her and of course go and visit her a couple of times a week. My mother, who works full time, has difficulties with coping with this rather limited amount of work regarding my grandmother. Thus, it seems to me very difficult for people to entirely treat elders at home in their families. Take for example a family of two adults and two small children. Managing full time jobs and taking care of their children seems to me as more than enough work for these adults. Imagine these two in addition having to take care of an elder. If the elder isn't that old and in realtively good health perhaps the workload will not be insurmountable. If the elder on the opposite is in bad health, perhaps unable even to go to the bathroom by his or herself, the situation seems unstable. If the elder needs day-time attention one of the providers will have to stop working full-time or perhaps stop working entirely. Of course there is always the possibility of hirering a nurse to take care of the elder but, evidently, far from all families have enough money to afford that. 
Single people obviously will be having even bigger problems treating the elder in their home. Living off only one half-time salary seems very difficult, if not impossible.
Furthermore, treating an elder in bad physical condition requires a certain amount of expertise, concerning medicine and such. Obviously authorised personnel could inform people how to do this, but would that be enough? In addition, if the elder is in such bad shape that he or she cannot walk or stand by his or herself, evidently the treatment of him or her will include really heavy lifts, which obviously will be difficult for physically weak individuals. 
A combination of lack of time and limited knowledge could lead to bad treatment of the elder, despite the best intentions. 
An inevitable part of the treatment of elders is death. If the elder should die in the home and not in a hospital, I believe this could lead to feelings of guilt and bad conscience. Did we do enough? Did we do anything wrong? 
Isn't there any advantages of treating elders in the homes then? Of course the state (or local authorities) will save money, surely large amounts of money, by moving the care of elders to the families. Furthermore, under the right circumstances the treatment of the elder could be much better in the family than in a home for old people.

Perhaps it is possible for families to look after the elderly, but it doesn't, seem like a good idea to me, as may stand clear. The advantages are few - the disadvantages are many. My main point is that the care of an elder takes to much time of peoples lives - I think that many people, who have any experience of care for the elderly, would agree with me. The system we have now is the best one for everybody, I believe, even though the standard of many homes for old people ought to be improved considerably.",0
217,2062.a2.txt,"An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.","Can killing a person be a solution of a problem in any situation? I do not think so. Of all the evil things that some people do, I find it very hard to see that the right punishment for that should be death. If we punish people for killing other human beings and judges them to death penalty, then we are as bad as the killers. Or is it possible to say that one murder is not as bad as an other, and that some people are worth more than other. Can you put a price on someones's life, and then if you had a lot of money you could pay and get your life back? I will in this essay clearly explain why I have come to have my opinion about capital punishment. I think that no one has the right to take someones life and therefore we should not allow capital punishment. Of course some people in this world seems to be nothing but evil, but still that do not give me the right to take their lives.
I do not think that I ever will be able to kill another person. So could it then be alright for me to think that death penalty is the right punishment as long as there is someone else who is pulling the trigger? Of course not, how could I let some one else do the ""dirty"" work. Some times I get really afraid when it does not seem to existe any limits for what evil things that some people can do. It looks like if the more horrible thing that they can find out to do the better. Of course you might ask what good it makes to spare that murderer's life and I have no other answar to that then than killing can not possibly be the solution to any problem.
To kill a criminal instead of dealing with the broken person that probably is hiding behind the crime is according to me the easiest thing that the society can do. No one cares enough to save a murderer's life. It costs a lot of money to provid some kind of rehabilitation, and some of the murderer you might not be able to help. But at least you could try. I do not think that the prisons of today are a good place to be if you are a criminal, you just get a really good chance to learn more bad things to do from the other prisoners. The condemneds have so much time when they are in prison, so why can we not let them do something useful for the society instead of learning new crimes. Of course it is very important to make the system safe so that no one could hurt another.
At last I would like you to think about a situation that happens sometimes. A person, might be at the wrong place at the wrong time an gets accused of murder. Than an innocent man/ woman gets the death punishment and perhaps the truth is not realized until there is to late. In this case a person that could have lived a long and happy life does not get the chance just because we think he/ her is guilty. Is it possible that a person with a lot of money is worth more than a poor. There do exists cases when a rich person who commits a murder gets away with it and a poor person who might be innocent gets convicted and gets the capital punishment. You might say that this is just a coincident but I would like to say that in the world that we are living money is power. So in this case it is possible to buy freedom.
Our life is a gift that we have been given. Most of the time we just live and do not have the time to stop and think about it. That is probably a good thing for hopefully we are living a good and happy life. Just the thought of taking another persons life to let justice be done make me questioning the future of this world. No one has the right to take another persons life, it is just as easy as that. If we want to put an end to the violence that exist in society then society can not be as bad as the criminal. We can not compare an eye for an eye with a life for a life because if we do that then we are human beings in great danger.",0
218,2063.a2.txt,Learning English at an early age,"Nowadays it's becoming more and more common that Swedish pupils start to learn English in school at a very young age. It provides the pupils with a better understanding and basic ground for the language since they get to practise it in a playful way, and they can slowly let their language abilities mature. Pupils understand a lot more English than we think they do since English is very common in today's society, in for example films, music and television. Starting early with English will also help the pupils to get a greater knowledge about the language in a natural way. I will now look into some advantages in learning English at an early age.

One major advantage is that when you are younger you learn more easily. It doesn't take very long for children to comprehend. They are willing to learn and they also think it's fun to learn new things, which is really important. This can be related to that children now can start school at the age of six instead of seven. Some children are ready to start learning, in a playful way, at the age of six. Of course it varies from child to child. The pupils need to be stimulated and my opinion is that it all depends on how you do it. They don't have to be able to spell every word they know at once, just get familiar and comfortable with the language. Later on, when the pupils are comfortable and ready for it, writing and reading can be introduced. 

Another major advantage is that the pupils gain a lot of self-confidence. Being able to speak and understand some phrases and words makes the pupils very proud and they can grow as individuals. Being self-confident, knowing that you can do and comprehend things, makes the entire learning process easier. It will probably develop and make them stronger in other subjects too.
Some parents and teachers might say ""Why learn another language when the children are struggling with their native language?"" But when you start to introduce English at an early age the main emphasis should be on listening and speaking. There are lots of activities to work with such as songs, games, colouring, cutting, repetitive stories and so on. By starting off with some of these activities the children are actually learning a great amount of English and having fun at the same time. Hopefully these activities will create a basic knowledge, a huge interest and curiosity among the children that will make it easier for them to continue their learning process. It's easier to learn a new language if you do it in a playful and natural way.

English is an international language and is spoken almost everywhere around the world. It's important to be able to communicate with the rest of the world and when looking for employment English is most of the time a criterion. Starting to learn English at an early age will later on be an advantage as the basic knowledge is very deeply and natural rooted. It's also quite common for children to have lived in another country since a lot of parents have the opportunity to work abroad. 

English should be introduced at an early age in a natural and comfortable way since younger children are very receptive to new impressions. They also enjoy it immensely. Young learners have a huge advantage since they've have been around English for a long time.",0
219,2064.a2.txt,Reintroduce the borrowing of course literature,"In November 1999, the Student library in Uppsala made the decision that all borrowing of course literature should be stopped, in order to save money. This upset many students, who would now have to get hold of their literature in other, less efficient ways. This, I think, is not something that should be allowed to occur at a big, renown university like Uppsala, and in my opinion the permission to borrow course literature should be reintroduced. To only be able to read the books at the library is not a good solution for all students. 
One point that argues against the fact that books should only be read at the library, is that not all students have the possibility to go to there during opening hours. Parents with small children may have difficulties being away from home more than a certain period of time a week, and students who live far away from the university, maybe even in another city, or those who have lectures during opening hours, are all unable to access the books. For these students, the possibility to have books on loan and the opportunity to read them at home, may for them be essential in order to pass the course. Those in favour of the prohibition maintain that more people will be able to read the books when not only one person has got access to them during a longer period of time. This may be true, but still, for students who don't have the possibility to go to the library regularly, it is unfortunately not a solution that is in their interest. 
The lack of enough seats at the library for all students, is something that also argues for the fact that the library should allow students to borrow books. If the argument that more people will have access to the books is true, then presumably this will also mean that the number of students that will need a place to study, at the library, will increase. Since the amount of places will not be increased, the number of students that compete for a seat will get higher, and then not all books available to read will be, even though there are several copies on offer. Also, those who need to use the books the most will not have the opportunity, because they will not be able to compete for the copies in the way that students who have regular access to the library can.
A way of saving money is borrowing the course literature. And even though many like to buy their own literature, course books are often very expensive and since the study allowances are not that high, a popular alternative is borrowing. Many courses have got a large amount of books that are included in the obligatory literature that students will need for their course. Because of that, many depend on the fact that they have always been able to borrow their books from the library, take them home, get to read them properly, and take notes. Additional literature and handbooks are often seen as an extra cost, and are therefore more often borrowed than bought. 
To many people, borrowing course literature is very important. Not all have the possibility to go to the library during opening hours, and the lack of seats will also make this impossible for the large amount of students who will be needing a seat at the library. Money, of course, is another argument, and I believe that the possibility to borrow course literature should be reintroduced in order to give the students a wider choice in how they get hold of their literature. After all, the university in Uppsala is supposed to offer their students the best, and the Student library should therefore be able to have course literature that is available for home loan. The saving of money should try to be made in other areas and not at the expense of the students. A library should not only be a place where people can sit and read books, but also an institution from which books can be borrowed.",0
220,2065.a2.txt,Adoption and artificial insemination - a matter of course for homosexuals,"For many people one of the most important things in life is to create a family. That often includes giving birth to a child or at least raising one. According to present laws that is impossible for homosexual couples because the only ones who jointly can adopt a child are a married heterosexual couple. Furthermore is it impossible for a man or a woman to adopt her or his homosexual partner's natural child. The Swedish Government also refuses people who live in a homosexual relationship permission to receive a foreign child for adoption. That is discrimination. 
The Partnership Act is the first law that expressly prohibits homosexual couples to adopt. The one who lives an open life as a homosexual and chooses to legalize her or his relationship by partnership is refused the possibility to adopt. The one who does everything to hide her or his sexual turn and is successful with that may also be approved as a single parent. That is absurd.
To receive artificial insemination the woman must be married to a man or at least living with one. This alternative is therefore also impossible for homosexual women. It is unethical.

Sweden is one of the few countries that expressly prohibit lesbian women access to artificial insemination. This has led to the fact that many lesbian women instead are letting themselves being inseminated at home or abroad. The result of this is that the fertilization often is made with sperm which is not HIV-tested. That is a risk both for the mother and the child. Furthermore the child may live under uncertain juridical conditions. Since registered partners are not allowed to receive artificial insemination, the Partnership Act also contributes and illustrates the negative view society has on homosexuals as parents, which not was its purpose. Ethical and medical reasons indicate that the society must give lesbian women their natural right to the same possibilities and conditions as heterosexual women have. Give them access to artificial insemination.

If the natural parent would pass away there is no possibility for her or his partner, who the child has grown up with and is emotionally bound to, to adopt the child. In Denmark it is allowed. Since 1996 Iceland allows homosexual couples who live in a partnership to jointly have the custody of a child. In the Netherlands the Government will possibly allow jointly custody and also adoption of children living in the country. This makes it highly important to revise Swedish laws on that point. Sooner or later one of these families will move to Sweden. According to present laws the family will not be excepted as a family and must split up. We can not allow that to happen. Splitting up a family because of the parents' sexual turn is inhuman. 

In Sweden there already are about 40 000 children who have at least one homosexual parent. It is either children from earlier heterosexual relationships or children who homosexuals have had by insemination or arranged sexual intercourse. This means that living with a homosexual parent (or parents) is not something new, it already exists. Research shows that these children are as popular and normal as other children. Therefore, children adopted by a homosexual couple will not be harassed or rejected because of their parents' sexual turn. However, the children who already live with homosexual parents do not, with present laws, have the same security as children with heterosexual parents. Moreover, if society keeps disparage homosexuals it is the children who will suffer.

Nowadays many children do not live in a ""nuclear family"". Living with only one parent is common. Having two parents is better than one, no matter what sex they are of. Homosexuals are as good parents as heterosexuals.

Since there already exist children who have homosexual parents, an adopted child with homosexual parents will be as popular and normal as other children. It also includes children whose lesbian mothers have gone through artificial insemination. By giving homosexuals the same rights as heterosexuals, children and parents would be more secure both in juridical and emotionally point of view. It is not what sexual turn a person has that should decide if he or she is suitable as a parent.",0
222,2067.a2.txt,Unpaid work - a punishment or an opportunity?,"Unemployment benefit must exist, but should one be able to live on them for a long time without being required to do something? I do not think so. I believe that most unemployed want to get a new job, but I also know that there are people who are quite content with being unemployed since they still get some money, and that without lifting a finger. I do believe that it would be a reasonable demand that unemployed should do unpaid work in the public sector. I do not think that it should be seen as a way of punishing the unemployed but as an opportunity for them to get new experiences.

Maybe it sounds hard that they have to do unpaid work but it is not unpaid is it?! All people have to work to get money so why should the unemployed be able to lie in bed all day and collect money. Perhaps it can feel unfair to work with those who are employed at the public service and know that they get more money for the same job. But they probably have education or experience that helped them get the job, and is it not as it should be that those who have education or experience should have a better salary? And as a ""unpaid worker"" you would not work fulltime since the society still wants you to be able to find a ""real"" job, and therefore you must have time to look for a new job and have the opportunity to go to job interviews. But in the meantime I believe that it is for the best for the unemployed to be able to work in the public sector.

It is a part of the Swedish mentality that you should work, if you do not the guilt comes crawling and says that you are not worth anything. Most people have to feel that they accomplish something to feel that he/she is worth something. I think that the self-esteem can touch rock bottom if a person is unemployed too long. If it is so that people cannot get a job for different reasons is it not better in those cases that they get a temporary job at the public service? I believe that those who think that unpaid work in the public sector is a punishment are those who are content with watching television all day and get ""paid"" for it, and is it them we should be listening to? Should we not be glad that we can support the society in which we live by working in the public sector instead of being home doing nothing? If you look at it, those who were formerly unemployed now have a ""job"" and the public sector gets ""free"" personnel that they really need. There are no losers.

You may think that the losers are those who are not fitted to work in the public sector, but there are many different kinds of occupations in the public sector and I am sure that they can find at least one kind of job that they would consider doing. For of course the unemployed must have some say in what they are willing to work with. Not everyone is suited to work at a day-care centre, and we have to respect that. Another aspect of unpaid work is that those who are without a job has an opportunity to get work experience and maybe later, the possibility to get a ""real"" job in the public sector or elsewhere. 

As I see it, it is only positive that those who are unemployed should be required to do unpaid work in the public sector. It is good for a person to know that he/she has accomplished something and that improves the self-esteem. The unemployed have the opportunity to get work experience, which can never be a bad thing, and perhaps they get to try something new. They also get the opportunity to help the society in which they live, and they still get the same amount of money as they would have if they were just hanging around at home growing apathetic. I strongly believe that it is an opportunity to do unpaid work, not a punishment.",0
223,2068.a2.txt,Cap - on or off in school,"One of the most intense debates in Swedish schools at the moment is weather students should have the right to wear a cap or not in the school during class. The use of caps even inside the schools has led to tussles. For many teachers and other adults the cap is seen as very provocative. What I don't understand is why this specific article of clothing is so loaded and for what reasons so many adults think that it is inappropriate to wear it inside. 

The cap has become a subject of debate that on some schools take a lot of time and energy away from the education. I believe that the way that teenager dress and behave always has been and always will be a subject constantly discussed among adults. However it is obvious that exactly this action, not taking the cap of inside the school, has got a quite special loading to it and is by many adults seen as altogether provocative. 

Headgear has always been a piece of clothing full of symbols. The Christian man still takes his hat of in church but the Jewish man on the other hand puts his kippa on before entering the Synagogue. In both cases the action is a way of showing humility for the Lord. Is it possibly the heredity demand on humility that explains many teachers' hot reaction towards the caps?

Earlier when both men and women used to wear hats, it was a breach of etiquette for men not to take their hats off when they came inside. Women on the other hand didn't need to take their hats off. These are old rules of etiquette but I believe that this is something that many elder people still take very seriously and therefore consider it ill mannered to wear a hat inside. Still I believe that these rules should be revised, since things change in our society all the time.

Maybe the teachers only want the students to show that they are not only physically present but also psychically; that the brake is over and that the work has begun. I don't believe that we should need a change of clothing to create intervals during the day. A good teacher should be able to make it clear to the students when the class starts without a ""dresscode"". I absolutely don't believe that the cap would make a student less receptive or motivated with a cap on. As long as the students can show that they can handle to participate in class, I see no reason to forbid them to wear a cap.

Some professionals mean that a cap could be compared with sunglasses or even a Walkman. I find this comparison foolish since the cap doesn't have any effect on a student's vision or hearing. I cannot understand how a cap can be an obstacle to students learning.

The teenagers today are often wearing their caps on days when they haven't had time to do their hair or when the hair is unwashed; it is very important to them to look fresh. The cap is also a part of many teenagers search for their identity and it also shows which group they belong to. The caps and sweaters are also tied to different sports and music. Logotypes show which team they are supporting. 

Teenagers always show what they like and it is very important to them to be different from other groups and above all from adults. Earlier teenager could wear jeans and T-shirts to differ from the adults, but that is no longer possible since adults dress the same way that teenager do today. I believe that a teacher who tries to stop this only is going to get trouble. I think that they should accept the caps and not get upset about the trifling matter that it actually is instead of trying to get rid of them. There are several far more important matters in school that the teachers could put their time into than this ridiculous struggle back and forward. 

The cap doesn't have any impact on the students learning abilities. The resistance against the use of caps is only based on old rules that has been handed down to us from a earlier generation that lived in an other society that we do today and therefore it has to change.",0
224,2069.a2.txt,Stop women's right to an abortion- to save whom?,"It is a frightening thought that people around the world spend all their energy trying to stop one of the most important features of modern society, free abortion. I will here defend the right to decide over ones own body as not everyone is convinced about the importance of free abortion. Of course I would like to live in a time were women only got pregnant when wanting to, but as a matter of fact, women do get pregnant even if they are careful. Of course rules about abortion are necessary, it is only a possible option as long as you can be sure that the foetus does not feel any pain and does not have the brain capacity to know what is going on. 

Every born child should have the right to be a longed-for baby, but this is only possible if the parents are allowed to make that decision themselves. If they, or more often she as most abortions are done by young women without a boyfriend to be there for her, feel that there is no possibility to take care of the future child, it is better if she makes this decision. I think that many foetuses now aborted, if the had to be born, would live a life that nobody would wish it did. People with handicaps are as valuable as I am, but I understand those parents-to-be that make a non-selfish decision to do an abortion when receiving the news that their child will live a life full of pain. Abortion is never used as contraception but as the final way out. Women that have gone through an abortion are not bloodthirsty and they wish there had been a better expedient. It is not an easy decision to make so why should she have to fear other people's reactions, when she probably fears her own guilty feelings more?

Abortion is a question of equality between men and women. It is a fact that many men are against abortion and I state that it is because they want to retake the power over their women, sometimes hidden under the opinion that it is against God's will. I am absolutely sure that if there is a heaven aborted foetuses will be let in. When an abortion is considered it is probably because the woman will face the parenthood alone, with or without a boyfriend, and therefor she should have the last say. Men's deciding over women is nothing that can be accepted in a modern society. Women are educated enough to know what is best for them, especially as the men trying to stop her seldom is her own boyfriend but men that really knows nothing about her and her situation. Of course, there are exceptions where women are ignorant and careless and do not understand the importance of avoiding getting pregnant when she by no means will be able to take care of the baby, but they are in a minority. Will she be a good mother? What would that woman have done if there were no abortions? 

A very important reason why abortion must be legal is that a lot of desperate women needing and wanting an abortion will do one anyway, history will tell us the truth in that statement. No one can discuss the fact that having an abortion done by a bungler is a huge threat to the health of both the woman and the foetus as this solution made in panic not often ends well. We will end up with a woman with a destroyed inside and with a still living baby in her womb who probably will suffer from sever injuries for the rest of its life. It is thus better that this minor operation is done by a professional, in a clean operation room where psychologists are available to take care of the woman afterwards.

Abortion is a necessary right if you call your country a modern one. An abortion can not be compared to murder, as the foetus is not aware of the reality and do not feel any pain. I wish that opponents of abortion would care as much about those children already in life, as they do about those who, for one important reason or another, will not face the world.",0
225,2070.a2.txt,No sex until marriage,"In this essay I will argue in favour of not having sex before marriage. By this I hope to convince the reader how much better the world would be if everyone lived under a ""law of chastity"". I will first discuss it from a religious perspective, but my main focus will be on the social aspect of this matter.

Almost everyone has heard the seventh commandment ""Though shalt not commit adultery"" (Exodus 20:14), but not everyone interpret it the same way. Many Christian congregations don't just interpret it that you shall not cheat on your spouse, but also that you must be faithful to your future spouse, meaning that you shall not have sex until you are married. 
But why is it wrong with premarital sexual relationships? We read in 1 Corinthians 6:13 and 18-19: ""...Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body... Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body, but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. What? Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own."" 
Here we can clearly see that by using your body for the wrong purposes you commit a terrible sin. When God said ""be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth"" (Genesis 1:28), he meant that this should only take place within the sacred bonds of marriage. ""Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge."" (Hebrews 13:4)
I will now proceed to explain why you shouldn't have sex before marriage from a social point of view. I read in Sydsvenska Dagbladet that Malm√∂ had the highest rate of teenage abortions in the Nordic countries, and the girls who are having an abortion are getting ever younger. Also the cases of chlamydia had more than doubled among teenagers. These are shocking facts! 
Almost every day we can read in the papers about abortions, rapes, pornography and similar things. Pornography is getting grosser and grosser and many experts think that the many gang rapes nowadays are due to the pornography several young men pore over. Some seem to think that what they see on film and in magazines can be transferred to real life. It appears that teenagers are put under a lot of pressure over the fact that they are virgins and think they are the only ones in this state. They have their sexual debut much earlier than ten years ago, some at the scandalous age of twelve! I think this is due to the excessive pornography which you have access to nearly everywhere; on TV, video, Internet and in magazines. No doubt you get the impression that everybody is having sex and then you feel that you must have it too. In the wake of this comes sexually transmitted diseases, abortions and most tragic, rapes. Just because you are fooled into believing that sex is something you must have. ""Be there (that is: do it) or be square"" so to speak. 
Now, these things would not be a problem if everybody lived under a ""law of chastity"". If we taught our children from the beginning that they don't have to have sex, but that it is perfectly OK to wait until you're married, much unhappiness would be eliminated. I think that fewer people would have premarital sex if they didn't feel the pressure from media, friends and even the sexual instruction in the biology class in school. At an early age children are taught that when they come of age it is natural to begin to have sex. There is no doubt that if you are not member of a religious society that claims that having premarital sex is wrong, you will probably not get the idea that you would wait to have it. Sometimes you get the impression that if you want to wait to have sex you are odd. But the fact is that many of my friends tell me that they wish they had the courage to go against society's norms and defer sexual relations until they have entered holy matrimony.
I hope that I have been able to convince you how advantageous it is to wait until marriage before engaging in sexual intimacies and that there are no doubts that I firmly believe in this.",0
226,2071.a2.txt,Social allowance are not for people who can work,"In Sweden we have to many people who are living on social allowance and dont't need to do it. I belive that people who really need to have social allowance are going to have it, but it should be a much better check-up of who really needs it and who don't. 

Nobody in Sweden needs to be starving or don't have the opportunity to have anywhere to live. If we need to, we can get help from the social service. That is a good thing that we have that help because anybody could get in a situaion where they really needed help from the social service. Some people can't earn enogh money, or maybe not any money at all, to survive. For example single parents, people who who can't get a job or are not able to work for special reasons or having other sorts of problems. I belive that they are those who are going to get help from the social service in the first place.

What I don't like is the fact that the social service in many cases don't check better who needs money and who is only using the system. There are for example a lot of young people who don't want to work and instead of trying to get a job, or maybe study, they go to the social service and get money. There are to many young people who are to lazy and are allowed to be lazy because nobody tells them that they have to do anything. They just make up a story that they have some sort of problem and the people who works for the social service belive them or don't care and give them social allowance.

They can get social allowance and don't even need to apply for a job, they don't need to study or do anything they don't want to do. They can go around in the city and meet friends all day if they wants to or lay in the bed and do nothing. They don't have any physical or mental illnesses at all. I don't think that helps them in any way, that nobody cares if they do anything or not. In stead they get money for somewhere to live, for cloths, for food, for travelling expences and money to exercise. A single person without children get 2900 SEK/month. That is for food, cloths and bills. Then they can get more money for paying rent, homeinssurance etc.

 Often they still live at home with their parents or don't live anywhere, they just go around and stay with friends and don't have any big expences. In stead they by things that they don't really need and go out partying and just have a good time for the money. It's a lot of things the money they get could go to, like resourses for care of children or elder people or for school.

I don't think that they would have a choise, they should have to get a job either they want it or not. And if they can't get a job where they earn enough money to live on they can get the rest from the social service, because then they are at least doing something for the society. They also get the oppertunity to up-keep their skills or learn new things. Often they don't even appriciate the money they get because they get them to easy, they know that they don't deserve the money.

The people in Sweden who works pay a lot of taxees and some of those taxees is money who the social service get to give to people who really needs them. I don't think that the people who pays all these taxees like the fact that some people who are just to lazy to earn their own money live on others.

I think it is terrible to see all these people who gets money from the social service when they can work to get it, and see other people who needs more money but can't get it, because some use the system in a wrong way. Social allowance is not supposed to be a permanent living.",0
227,2072.a2.txt,Student loans: A lifetime in debt,"Loans to finance our nations students? To me it seems quite like a contradiction. Who would prefer a lifetime in debt just so you can go to school? Well, I believe that any normal person with common sense would answer nobody on the question asked. Furthermore changes ought to be done such as give students grants instead of loans. What is more important is that Sweden as a country would become more internationally successful, which could enhance our economic status both abroad and perhaps even more importantly our domestic situation. Lets take a look at the situation today: If you manage to get a job after graduation at the age of eighteen you may consider yourself very lucky and even more if you find a fulltime job. The main problem ofcourse is money. What to do? You cannot parasite on your parents for ever and you do not want to become a bag-lady. Higher education somebody said, and you think you have the answer that solves all your problems. I want to become a Master of Engineering, it is an interesting and well paid job. In other words I will have four and half years of studies to look forward at, perhaps move to another city if required. Now we can start to look at the expenses of the project to come. Books and study material for four and half years, semester fees, travels, rents, and food to stay alive but these are not the only expenses because I am very sure students have a personal life too. 
In some way students need to find money to cover all these expenses. What the state has to offer is a grant of almost two-thousand kronors which surprisingly for them is not enough however every student I have spoken to tend to agree with me. What are my options now? - I could ask my parents for some money but this is not really their problem now is it? I am sure they would like to me help out and it makes me feel as if the government thinks the same but I am an adult who cannot depend on my parents all the time. Perhaps if I took a part time job I could manage to pay my studies, and probably yes I would. On the other hand it says in the brochures that this education is a full time occupation so it is not reasonable to ask somebody to work more then full time just so he or she could make a living. Our options are narrowed down to the last one, the almost obligatory loan. To live a decent life most students will take the highest amount allowed, five-thousand kronors which gives you a total of seven-thousand kronors. Now everybody is happy and satisfied until the day when the state wants their money back. 
After four and a half years of full time studies ex. students have approximately reached a debt of twohundredthousand kronors plus interest. This is a debt which hardly nobody manages to pay off during their lives as taxpayers. Luckily the debt is written off at the age of sixty-five when you retire as a pensioner. 
You wonder if this is the thanks you get from the state when you could have lived on unemployment benefits watching TV and do nothing all day long. In contrast I pay the highest taxes on earth, and try to pay off my loan. In addition I am a jackpot for the state and I don't cost a penny neither. To sum up I believe there should not exist such a ting as a student loan, it is only an obstacle which many people will not manage to pass. With the taxes of today we should not have any problem with the finance of higher education students, in longer perspective society will only gain from this system. Instead of a lifetime debt as a repeler we should give higher education studies the same status as a regular job and pay the seven-thousand as a kind of salary.",0
228,2074.a2.txt,Europe: Co-operation or every one for themselves?,"It is the 7'Th of May 1945, Hitler has committed suicide one month ago and today Germany surrenders, the Second World War is over. The European continent is destroyed by the war that took the lives of around 50 million people. Today, a little more then fifty years later the former enemies are sitting side by side in Brussels and Strasbourg trying to steer Europe into the 21'st century. 

Since the start with the Coal and Steel Union the European Union has been guaranteeing a stable and strong platform for peace and democracy in Europe. During it's short history the Union has kept evolving as the bonds between its members have become stronger and stronger. The European Union should be allowed to keep developing and it should be allowed to handle the things that are of common interest for the entire continent such as the Environment, fighting Crime as well as the Defence and Foreign Policies. The union should be given more powers in these areas, not less. 

The protection of the environment is one of the most important issues of modern society. It is widely recognised by scientists that environmental issues can not be solved by any nation on it's own. The problem of air-pollution is a good example of this. Air pollution can travel great distances, thus affecting countries other then the one it originated from. It is financially very costly for companies to adapt factories etc. to become more environmental- friendly. National governments may therefore be reluctant to impose hard environmental legislation, since this might scare away investments. However, if all the countries in a region enforce the same legislation, then this problem is greatly reduced. The same argument can be used on almost all environment related issues. 

Another area in witch the European Union has a lot to do is fighting crime. Researchers claim that organised crime is growing every day. This type of criminality rarely operates in just one country, but rather over large parts of the Union. If we were to introduce a federal court system with common laws to fight narcotics offences, smuggling, financial crimes etc. over all of the EU, assisted by a federal police force, it would be much easier to map out these organisations. Today the local police forces try to assist each others (with varying success) but the difference in the police organisations, laws and bureaucracies of the countries causes many problems when it comes to quickly arranging police operations between two countries. A federal police force that could perform these tasks would be very useful to fight crime and co-ordinate the national police forces. 

The European Union of today is a Union of sovereign states, but states with common values and goals. The differences in religion and culture are not large and this has, in my opinion paved the way for the success of the Union. It is only reasonable for these countries to have a common foreign policy and military forces. Currently each member is defending there own border, if we were to decide to have a common military structure the amount of boarder lines to defend would be just a fraction of the old ones, and we would be able to greatly reduce defence costs for the member countries. We would also virtually have taken away the last possibility for another war in Europe. Recently the European countries demonstrated their common values by protesting loudly when Austria elected J√∂rg Haider's extreme right party to the Austrian parliament. The values and political traditions are very similar in the different countries and a united European voice would have a much stronger effect then the many small ones of today. 

To conclude this brief argumentation for a stronger European Union, with more power to affect the questions that are important for the entire continent I want to stress that ""The European Union of today is a Union of sovereign states, but states with common values and goals"". This is very important to remember when discussing EU matters. We can decide to choose a path for Europe where everyone goes on their own (a way that would have it's benefits for some well developed states) or we can choose the path of co-operation, the path of working together, the path of a union with common human rights values that sets a good example to the rest of the global community. Together we can tackle the problems and issues of tomorrow, together we can build a strong, stable and prospering Europe.",0
229,2075.a2.txt,The utter justice or murder sanctioned by the state: Can capital punishment be justified?,"Introduction
The use of capital punishment has historically been used in almost all countries as a punishment for the most serious crimes. Most western countries changed the view of the individual after the Age of Enlightenment. The life of each individual was seen as more sacred and this showed in the judicial systems; both in the legal rights of the individual but also on imposed penalties. 
Today 93 countries out of 193 still use the capital punishment in their legal systems. Few western countries are using this penalty today, an exception is the US (some, but not all states) where it is used mainly as a punishment for murder. 
This essay will explore four arguments that support capital punishment and answer with counter-arguments. Since the US is a western country, with a culture similar to European culture, I have chosen most arguments from there and not from non-western countries like Iran or Singapore. It is a paradox that the US still use this kind of penalty, in many other aspects its Constitution protect the right of the individual; e.g. the right of free speech and religion. 

Arguments for and against capital punishment
The first argument for the capital punishment is that it is a deterrent to criminals. If someone knows that there is a chance of paying with her life for doing a crime, this should make her hesitate before doing it. This argument makes sense; why would a rational person do something that may risk her life? This argument is valid as long as we assume that all persons are rational. This is not the case however and studies show that the capital punishment does not have a preventative effect at all. People seldom think rationally before doing a serious crime, but usually commit it under emotional stress of various reasons. 
Another argument for advocating the capital punishment is on theocratic grounds. According to Mosaic Law there should be ""an eye for an eye..."", this is usually interpreted as the right of vengeance for the relatives of a victim. Even if we assume that we know that the defendant is guilty, this is nevertheless not a valid argument for the state to do the same awful crime. Murder the murderer; it is still murder of a sacred life, only sanctioned by the state. If the legal system get a streak of vengeance it has proved to lead to more violence. Besides, we do not live in biblical times anymore. Mosaic Law is very much a question of interpretation, very few follow the bible literally in other matters. 
A third argument is the certainty of no reiteration of a criminal behavior from the defendant, to protect the public from a person who is assumed to be incorrigible. Even if one do not think that serious criminals' lives are sacred (a condition of the second counter-argument), one must still assume that it is certain that the accused really is guilty, otherwise the state is doing the same awful crime as the defendant; murdering an innocent person. In contrast, studies have shown that numerous of people in death roll have had such bad defense during their trials, that they were declared mistrials when offered a proper defense. Even if you believe in the sacredness only of the ""innocent"" individual, one mistake like this is reason enough to abolish the capital punishment.
A forth argument from advocates is that it is assumed to be cheaper to execute people than keeping prisoners of a lifelong sentence in prison. This argument is very cynical and used by ""pragmatic"" people who do not believe in the sacred life (of guilty or innocent). However, disregarding the earlier arguments for abolishing this penalty, this argument still lacks support. It is six times more expensive to commit a death penalty, including trials, lawyers and experts etc, than a lifetime sentence. This on the other hand has made the advocates of capital punishment suggesting it to be even harder to appeal to the Supreme Court over a death sentence, as a way to lower the costs. Thus, the insecurity regarding the rights of the individual will increase even more.

Conclusion
Advocates of the capital punishment use many arguments to justify the remaining of the penalty. Arguments that are supposed to be supported by empirical evidence have shown no support: the use of capital punishment does not work well as a deterrent, neither is it cheaper than life sentence in prison. Another argument is the certainty that the accused of a major crime must never get the chance of doing it again. Since a legal mistake in a country with the capital punishment is irreparable, it must here be assumed that the defendant has had a fair trial and is guilty beyond any doubts. This is far from the truth, the legal system in the US - as well as many other countries - is dependant on which lawyer one can afford. Finally advocates plead the right of vengeance. This is an ancient way of thinking and it has been proved that violence breeds violence. To sum up, advocates of the capital punishment do not have one valid argument for this inhuman and uncivilized punishment.",0
230,3001.a2.txt,"Sweden, just say No to the EU!","In this essay I will present two of the main reasons why Sweden ought to leave the European Union. There are, as I see it, more reasons than those two that I'm going to deal with. But I'll concentrate on the two that I've considered to be the most important. Namely that, first of all the EU isn't a democratic union and second of all the countries that are supposed to work together have to little in common for them to be able to work effectively with governing the union. Both reasons are strong reasons not to continue being part of the union although the first is the strongest reason you could ever think of.
The threats against democracy today are many, not all of them having to do with right winged fanatics with shaved heads and kickerboots. No, I believe that the biggest threat today is the EU. Because, if we examine the word, democracy stands for government by the people and/or social equality. Now people may say a lot of good things about the EU but it is not governed by the people although I might go so far as to say that when it comes to social equality, no country that I know of has ever been equal in every sense of the word. Therefor I will not complain about the EU not being equal. I will instead concentrate on the government by the people part. 
The EU today is a maze of red tape and do not enter signs, how will the public ever get an insight into the decisions if the people running the EU continue trying to keep much of what they do as secret as possible. For example, when an official in the EU leaked information to the newspapers about corruption in the European parliament. The people he worked for didn't exactly congratulate him on being so honest, no, they demoted him, he got a job as a cleaner in the European parliament, needless to say he soon thereafter quit his job. When this question was debated many argued that the decision to replace him was the right one, because he had gone to the press and not to the parliament. He went to the people living in the EU and not to the people who ruled the EU because he felt that the people had a right to know first. That is illegal. But so is, I fell, corruption. Therefor, I fell, he should have been rewarded not demoted in the way that he was.
This is a very frightening example, and I would believe it scares a lot of people working in the European parliament and a lot of people living in the EU. I mean who wants to start sweeping floors just because someone else on his/hers job is being dishonest and he/she can't look the other way? And who wants to be governed by people that demotes honesty? I certainly do not want either of it, and I can't believe that anyone else wants that to happen. Now, some might argue that if you don't like the people making the decisions, you could choose not to vote for them the next time. But if you do not know what is going on in the parliament, How can you decide who is honest and who is not? And if you got demoted for telling the public the truth about some of your colleagues and what they did with the publics money. Who would dare to tell the truth?
My second reason why I think Sweden ought to leave the EU is that the counties in the EU has to little in common with each other to be able to work effectively together. I'll try to be as brief as possible when explaining this. I'm not saying that because we have our differences we cannot work together at all in the EU, what I'm trying to say is that we cannot work the way we are doing it now. I mean how can someone who has been living in Spain or Italy all his life fully understand the problems facing the farmers in the north of Sweden or Finland, to take one example. The information they get is from the Swedish/Finnish representatives and they might not know or care enough about the subject to give the full picture. I would have liked to develop that thought further but the essay would become altogether to long if I did so I'll try to wrap this up now.
The two reasons I have presented are to me strong reasons for Sweden to leave the EU, but of course I'm not impossible. If the problems that I have addressed are solved then I see no reason for us not to stay in the union, just as long as we don't join the EMU.",0
231,3002.a2.txt,"What is on your plate, and why? - An essay about vegetarianism","Defending eating meat is very difficult. In fact, I have never heard an argument that justifies it. Still, practically all people in the western world feed on other animals. Is this really necessary, or is it just our comfortable way of life that makes us do it? I claim the latter. Since no one can give me a decent answer to the question of why they eat dead animals for dinner, then I guess there is none. There are a lot of arguments against it though, and I will present some of them to you.

The most obvious reason to avoid meat is of course the animals themselves. A good dinner does not really make up for killing an innocent creature. And most animals that end up on our plates have not even lived a worthy life. They are bred only for the purpose of being eaten. As a part of a large industry, they are looked upon as products, and the important thing is not that they are healthy and happy, but that the company maximises its profit. Even though there are exceptions to this rule, it is wrong of us to play God and decide whether another animal should live or die. An animal that has lived in a small farm, or free in the forest has probably had a better life, but is still a living being. Equally living as we are. You go to prison for killing a person, why shouldn't you go there for killing an animal? Some people desperately defending this action claim that it is alright to kill an animal because we can not know if it has feelings. I say the same thing, but use it as an argument against the slaughtering. We do not know how they feel about being hunted down and shot, and therefore we should not do it.

There are also more egoistic reasons to become a vegetarian. Considering the amount of people starving in the world today, us all becoming vegetarians would be a simple solution. Producing meat is not as easy as one might think. It takes time, food, space and water. There is enough food produced to satisfy the whole human race every day, but so much of it goes to breeding cows, pigs and chickens that we get to go hungry. Poor people die so that rich people can eat ham. There is something wrong with this picture. 

If you are one of these rich, ham-loving persons who do not care what happens to their neighbour, then consider your own health. Vegetarian food contains less fat, and especially less saturated fat. It also contains more vitamins. And above all this, something that most people do not think about, it contains less environmental toxins than meat and such. The toxins are stored in the fat of an animal or a human, and then passed on to the one who eats it. This means that the higher up in the food chain you are, the more toxic waste you eat. Skipping a few steps in the food chain is a good move.

I have been a vegetarian for about two and a half years. In the beginning I somewhat missed the classic Swedish meatballs, but I soon learned to get over it. I see no reason going back into meat eating, and I will only make vegetarian food for my prospective children. Many would question this on the basis that children need healthy food with a lot of proteins and such. But I know that you can get all you need out of vegetables and beans if you put a little effort into it. Vegetarian food is healthy, tasty and cheap. And what kind of argument is ""Meat tastes good"" really. Isn't it a bit like saying ""Robbing people is fun""? Think about it all for a while, and get back to me when you have found a stable argument.",0

The ruling established that Americans' right to privacy should include the right of a woman to decide whether to have children, and the right of a woman and her doctor to make that decision without state interference, at least in the first trimester (about the first 13 weeks) of pregnancy. However, in recent years, the Supreme Court and Congress have begun to allow new restrictions on abortion. States can now limit pre-viability abortions (when the foetus couldn't survive outside the womb), even in the first trimester. In addition other restrictions, such as the requirement to involve parents or a judge in the decision, are now common. These obstacles are designed to frighten and discourage women from terminating their pregnancies.
An unplanned pregnancy is an issue, which many American women face. Each year, more than 50% of all pregnancies are unintended. About half of these, 1.5 million, are ended by abortion. Quite contrary to what you might think, the women who have abortions come from all racial, ethnic, socio-economic, and religious backgrounds. This illustrates that the right to abortion is something that many American women benefit from in spite of background and present situation. Illegal abortions put the health and life of quite a few 
women at risk, as well as it favoured wealthy women who could afford to raise money in order to pay for more skilled doctors who were willing to take a chance, rather than getting a ""back-alley"" abortion. 
There are several other reasons to be pro-choice, i e for women's rights to choose abortion. One of them is that under certain circumstances it is highly understandable to want to end the pregnancy. These circumstances include rape, incest, a very young mother or immediate danger to the mother's health. The problem is that people who are pro-life, i e against abortion, tend to value the life and rights of the foetus higher than the mother's. They talk about the baby's right to be born and argue that the unborn should not be held responsible for its mother's actions or any harm done to its mother. First of all I think that it's incorrect to call the foetus a ""baby"" and refer to it as ""life"", when most abortions are actually done within the first 8 weeks. At that time the ""baby"" consists of a cluster of cells, which still could be considered a part of the female body. Consequently there is no reason, other than to upset the mother, for referring to abortion as murder. Secondly I don't think it's fair of them to totally disregard the mother's mental and physical health along side her right to choose, since it's her body and her life. 
I find it rather appalling that certain anti-abortion zealots, who are so concerned about the well being of some (the foetus), engage in harassment of pro-choice doctors as well as vandalism of abortion clinics. In recent years pro-life violence has even escalated to clinic bombings, physical attacks on doctors and patients and even murders. Although far from all pro-lifers support the murder of doctors, this somewhat proves that the anti-abortionist movement is somewhat hypocritical with a ""holier-than-thou"" attitude. 
Another aspect to take into consideration is the quality of life, both the mother's and the future baby's. Statistics show that teenage mothers are more likely than other women to drop out of school, develop health problems, receive inadequate prenatal care, rely on public assistance to raise her child and have her marriage end in divorce. Also, if the risk of the baby being gravely disabled, dying in infancy or being born still is high, you have to ask yourself if that is something you are ready to cope with - there are all ready enough unwanted children in the world.",0
234,3013.a2.txt,NA,"There are those who maintain that the family, not the state, should look after the elderly. I think that this is a socio-political and ethical topic that concerns us all. I believe that everybody should have the right to be taken care of no matter if we are rich or poor and neither should the colour of our skin and political ideas influence. Moreover, today's society doesn't really allow us to look after our elderly relatives, as we have to make ourselves a career, work full-time, bring up a family, spend quality time with friends, etc. The geriatric care can best see to that they are given the best help possible, not the family.
Here below I will account for the three main arguments against the privat care of the elderly.
First of all I would like to claim that this is our right as taxpayers and we have the right to make use of what we have built up.
Growing old is part of most lives, and to be taken care of is not only a social right that we have, it is also a service that we have the right to buy since this service has been established owing to our taxes (the elderly do pay for the help they are given). 
Secondly we have the juridical aspects of it. Who is to be hold responsable if anything should happen? Could I be responsable for my mother's medical care not being a doctor? Do I have the responsability to give my grandmother the intellectual stimulation that her age requires, not being a therapist of any kind? I don't think so, just as I can't hold a doctor responsable for the horrible buildings of the seventies.
Since the geriatric care is a service that the elderly have to pay for, I believe that they have the right to get qualified help from people that have the appropriate education and know how to accomodate the service to the need of the elderly. 
The final and third argument considers the quality of their lives. There are those who think that we need to spend more time with our relatives, so why not spend time with them and take care of them at the same time. It is true that we have lost that nearness or connection within the families that was so common some 30-40 years ago, but to give them a bath or to help them whith their activity of daily living is not the same as spending quality time with them. With quality time I refer to the social and cultural interchange and profit of people sharing time together. Anybody could help the elderly to prepair their breakfast or to do their cleaning, but only the relatives are close enough to know what they appreciate to do, what they like to read, to see, etc. We, the family, should spend more time with them to show them that we care and leave the nursing to the qualified medical service. 

Before I sum up this essay, I would like to stress the old generation's work and it should not be taken for granted. They were the ones to develop the Swedish welfare state and yesterday 's values, for instance, today both men and women can think about their careers at first hand, their lives will not come to an end just because they don't have children or a family. There are many elderly without relatives today and I think that there will be many more when our generation gets there, but we should still have the right to know that we are going to be taken care of even if we don't have relatives or someone to plead our cause.
I believe that it's not the same to care for the elderly and to take care of them. We do care for our grandmothers and we do take care of them if we let the state look after them, after all, they do deserve the best help there is to get as they have already paid for it.",0
235,3018.a2.txt,Introduce Compulsory education for future Principals!,"In the schools of today the Principals bear the utmost responsibility for everything that concerns the school. That means they have to master a vast variety things. Being knowledgeable about economics and the preparing of budgets concerning very large amounts of money is just as important as being competent in areas like personnel administration. It is a very hard job which means that you have to be very competent to manage it. Therefore it would seem insane not to give future Principals the chance to assimilate this competence and at the same time give society the certainty that their principals are skilled ones. Unfortunately no such chance or certainty is given in the schools of today. The vast majority of peoples that become Principals have previously worked as teachers which is very good because it gives them a first rate knowledge of the school system. But it in no way gives them the competence for a job equivalent to Vice Director in a major company. The only way to make sure that future principals really possess the competence required for the job is to introduce compulsory education.

One of the main points of such an education would be to increase the proficiency in economics. If you would want a job with equivalent economic responsibilities outside the school system you would have to study at least five years at university. Economics is a very important part of a Principal's work and when neglected a debility could dramatically reduce efficiency in the whole school. It will cost a lot of money to educate all future principals. But these costs are nothing compared to the big resource losses each year caused by bad economic planing by incompetent principals. There are very large amounts of money pumped into the school system every year so it really lays in the taxpayers best interest to make sure that all of it is used as efficiently as possible. In these days of down cuts and reduced means to education it is more important then ever to have competent leaders that know how to reduce economical loses. There is just no room for mistakes anymore. The vast majority of those that become principals have no earlier experience of working with economic issues. Obviously this is a great problem and it is also quite obvious that educating these peoples are absolutely crucial to obtain well functioning schools.

Well functioning schools does naturally not consist only of a well oiled economic machinery but of several other just as important pieces. Personnel administration is maybe the most prominent of these. Organizing workschedules and supervising the efficiency necessary in an organization as big as a school is one of a Principal's main purposes. It is a very difficult duty especially if you don't have a back round in personnel administration. Not many peoples that become Principals do. Personnel administration is not some thing you know instinctively. It is something you have to learn. It is absolutely absurd to think that peoples without any relevant education or experience can perform a good job on their own. If I were to apply for a job as a Staff Manager on a company with about a hundred employees (the size of an average school) I would probably have to show a higher certificate in personnel administration and some good references confirming my competence to even have the slightest chance of getting the job. Isn't it very strange that the demands are so much lower on peoples holding key positions in the schools than outside them? It is about time we raised these demands and made sure that principals do have the competence required for a directorship. Many regard the school as some thing inferior, crippled by inefficiency and incompetence. In some cases my own experiences correspond very well to that picture and that makes me sad. The only way to turn this negative trend is to raise the standard of competence in the whole school management. There are shorter voluntary courses for Principals and future Principals to take and they are used to some extent. But the problem is not Principals that acknowledge their own deficiency and do something about it. It is all those incompetent Principals out there who when asked would say he/she was doing a marvelous job and that there were no faults on their behalf that are dragging the whole school system down. Having compulsory education for peoples that want to become Principals is the only way to spare the school system these burdens that constitute a great handicap. Of course there should be exceptions made from this compulsory education for peoples that of varying reasons already posses the competence required. The idea is to increase competence and improve efficiency not to scare peoples from becoming Principals. To educate Principals will not make the world a better place. Or maybe it will? Many peoples will at least be spared the frustrating situation of working under an incompetent Principal and see their school limp because of inefficiency; never quite reaching its full potential.",0
236,3020.a2.txt,THE SWEDISH MONARCHY A NICE TRADITION WORTH KEEPING?,"In dictionaries the word democracy is defined as ""a system of government in which everyone in the country can vote to elect its members"" and as ""a situation in which everyone is equal and has the right to vote, make decisions etc"". The word monarchy is defined as ""a system in which a country is ruled by a king or a queen"". Sweden is paradoxically both a democracy and a monarchy and the way I see it a country cannot or at least should not be both.

Some of the main arguments I have heard from people who wants to keep the monarchy are that ""Sweden has always been a monarchy"" and "" it's such a nice tradition"". Yes, Sweden is one of the oldest monarchies in Europe and we have a history full of fascinating stories about royal war-heroes, conspiracies and mysteriously murdered kings. But those arguments aren't relevant to the issue. Today's system and society can't be compared with for example the eighteenth century and our present king Carl XVI Gustav can't be compared with Carl XII. The word is constantly changing and today monarchy is an old-fashioned system which doesn't fit into a democratic society such as ours. To use history and tradition as arguments in this serious matter is just a naive and ignorant way of trying to avoid discussion and debate. We have to eliminate the romantic and sentimental image that surrounds the royal family and the monarchy as a system. We have to look at our society from a logical and practical point of view.

I mentioned the word democracy and it's meaning earlier. People around the world are fighting for it. People sacrifice their lives for the right to vote and choose their leaders, the right to speak their mind and the right to be treated as equals. Democracy is not as obvious to everybody as it is for us. In a monarchy the regent is not elected. The Swedish monarch is not chosen by the people and he/she does not have the same rights as everybody else. He/she does not have the right to vote, he/she is not free to choose his/her religion and despite the fact that he/she is the head of our state he/she has got no political power. But still he/she ranks above everybody else and he/she requires to be addressed as ""his/her royal highness"" or ""your majesty"". And all that because he/she was born a crown-prince/princess and through inheritance became head of a state. Sweden is a democracy. 

The Swedish people want to be treated as equals and with respect. Men and women, homosexuals and heterosexuals, natives and immigrants etc. Then why do more than 70% of the Swedish population accept this kind of class-difference and segregation where a small, limited group of people are treated as if they were more important and worth more respect than the rest of the people just because they were born by royal parents? Is it because ""it's such a nice tradition""?

Another argument that I have come across is the royal family's popularity. People seem to love reading and talking about their romances and other private matters. The media's coverage of the royal family has increased and the interest among the population has also increased because of that.. That argument would become very weak if today's media-situation would change and that is exactly what the royal family wants. They are beginning to complain about the lack of privacy and the media's interference of their lives and that is understandable. But their popularity depends completely on the media. So, is their popularity totally based on the fact that they are a never-creasing source of gossip and would they be as popular if the monarch had the power?

History, tradition and popularity are all quite weak arguments pro-monarchy. But they are also very difficult to ignore. These things are deeply rooted in the Swedish people. We have become used to the monarchy and a habit is always difficult to break. But the society of today is in need of a change. Today's monarchy is an old fashioned and reactionary system where the monarch's only function seems to be waving at people from a balcony, cutting ribbons and throwing champagne-bottles at boats. Do we really need that?",0
237,3023.a2.txt,Meat verses vegetables: arguments for a vegetarian lifestyle,"Some people say that meat is murder. Is it? Whether you like the expression or not, you can not escape from the fact that meat comes from a dead animal and in one way or another the animal has been killed. If it has not died of natural causes which is quite rare when it comes to the meat that we eat. This essay will not further take up the discussion about murder or not murder but it will try to give you reasons not to eat meat. Because my conviction is that there are a lot of good reasons. I have been a vegetarian for about four and a half years and I have had to answer the question ""why a vegetarian"" quite a few times.

Therefore I'm now about to give you some of my arguments. The first reason I want to share is that I don't want to support the meat industry. Because an industry is what it has become. The questions this industry seems to be dealing with are for example; How can we make a bigger profit? How can we produce a large amount of meat in a short time? How can we feed the chickens so they grow fat but still not so fat that they die of a hart attack? How can we fit in as many pigs as possible in one place without them dying of distress?

So it seems like animals are looked upon as food from the day they are born until the day they die. People usually does not like to know about how animals are slaughtered or how they are treated during transportation. Some people does not even want to hear the word pig in connection with a meal consisting of bacon. To be able to eat meat with a clean conscience it seems like you have to keep the distance. I think that is a bit hypocritical. (Of course there are exceptions among public). Are we not able to take responsibility of our own actions? The meat industry is - like all other industries - about money. Almost no matter on what costs that means for the animals. Does the animals not deserve more respect from human beings who reckons themselves to be on a higher level? I definitely think that they do. This does neither mean that I think that animals and human beings are totally equal nor does it mean that I think they are supposed to have the same rights. What I do think is that we are abusing our position and treating animals in a bad way. I don't want to support that. 

In fact we don't need to eat meat to survive. Of course there are good things like protein and minerals in meat. But that is not something that you can not find elsewhere. Beans, chickpeas and lentils are all rich of protein. If you are a vegetarian but still eat eggs and drink milk you don't have to worry at all the lacking of protein. It is not that complicated to eat nutritiously. You just have to be observant that you have a varied diet.

The thing is that it's not only ourselves as individuals that gets healthier with a vegetarian lifestyle. If we did not have to feed as many beef cattle as we do right now we could instead feed people that are starving. It is a real energy loss taking so many steps in the food chain. If the consumption of meat diminished we would not have to cut down parts of the rainforests to find more arable ground. Even though all people wouldn't turn vegetarians, everybody (including the animals) would gain if we did not eat as much meat as we do. This is not the time for only thinking about our own welfare and pleasure as most people seem to think that meat is a part of. We are not alone on this planet.

Finally; animals are suffering, people are starving, inhabitants in the high-meat-consuming west world are growing fatter and becoming sicker. Even though there are a lot more to say on this topic I think these are arguments strong enough to stop or at least reduce our consumption of meat. They are enough for me. Are they enough for you?",0
238,3026.a2.txt,Save our intergalactic reputation: wear a bicycle helmet 24 hours a day!,"Head injuries cost the taxpayers of this country huge amounts of money all the time and cause tremendous suffering for the poor victims. To put an end to all of this I want everyone to use bicycle helmets, 24 hours a day. God gave us only one brain. When everyone wears a helmet it will become part of our lives and we can use it for other things than protection also. Put in a few of the machines we use so frequently today e.g. cell phone, computer, fax machine and we would have ourselves a mobile communications center. No to mention what the helmet could do for our looks, replacing that pain-in-the-butt hair.

I would like to plead for the use of bicycle helmets. Not only when riding a bike, but also when driving the car, when walking the dog, when sitting at the computer, when sleeping in the bed, in other words: using our bicycle helmets 24 hours a day! Head injuries of all kinds cost the country large amounts of tax money every year. Money that could be spent on more funny things, such as building railroads for instance. Also think about all the poor people that have been injured or that maybe even have died in accidents. Think of all the pain that could be prevented. The head is in some cases man's most valuable asset. Meet the brain ladies and gentlemen, with its complex structure and billions and billions of brain cells it is the most excellent piece of biology that we know of. It is immensely powerful but yet so tremendously vulnerable. It is one of our finest gifts from God and I think it deserves our full gratitude. Putting on a bicycle helmet would be the very least we could do for it. What if we encounter extra terrestrial beings some day and they find out about us that we actually sometimes ride a bicycle downhill without holding the hands on the handlebars and not wearing a helmet. First impressions last.

Instead of trying to make contact with aliens, we could improve our terrestrial communications further. If everybody used a bicycle helmet 24 hours a day biking or not, there would be an awful amount of helmets and they could and would be found everywhere. Why not taking the opportunity and place GSM antennas in each and every one of them? Cell phones would work anywhere. Speaking of cell phones and mobile communication, why not put it all right in to the helmet, making it a personal communication's center. It would replace the computer workstations we use today. Just hook up your helmet to the Internet, put on the Virtual Reality glasses for a screen and place your inflatable keyboard on your lap. You would be all set. Scanner, fax-machine, document shredder available 24 hours a day only an arm's length away. And when the technology and time is right we could probably hook up our brain to the helmet which would give the brain direct access to the internet, a must for modern man. Boundaries between human tissue and digital signals would become more and more diffuse. Biological viruses could be terminated with software virus killers.

When talking about this wonderful technology we must not forget about the last but not least important argument of why to wear a bicycle helmet 24 hours a day. Now, I know that the strongest argument against my thesis is that bicycle helmets allegedly destroy hairdos. But I say that the use of helmets 24 hours a day replaces the whole function of hair. When installing the helmet onto the head, the hair could be genetically removed and we would not have a problem anymore. The individuality one could express with hair could instead be expressed with the helmet and its unique possibilities such as: different designs, materials, colors etc. Instead of going to the hairdresser you could go to the helmet workshop. Get a new look in 10 to 15 minutes. Either you switch helmets or you just repaint it with fast drying spray color, all in a few minutes compared to an hour at the hairdresser's place. In the helmet workshop you would not have to experience any microscopic, itching hairs under your sweater, no hairdresser failures that would make you stay at home for a month and there would be no regrets of cutting your long beautiful hair off. You would not have long beautiful hair. I believe I represent the majority of the people when I say that it is visually attractive to wear bicycle helmets.

I hope that more people will realize that they can not do with out a bicycle helmet. The helmet that I consider a universal tool of great usage for the ones it is intended for, that is for us, the humans. It will replace headaches, personal computers and maybe most important of them all, it replaces hair. Let us be grateful to God for giving us the brain with which we can think of such great ideas. Just let us protect it with a bicycle helmet!",0
239,3028.a2.txt,Countenance of School Fee Vindicable?,"Folk Development Colleges, FDC: s, were launched in Tanzania, East Africa, in 1965 and as well one of the constituent parts of a successful national literacyteaching movement. The fundamental idea behind these about 75 colleges was to improve standard of living in the rural areas by educating its population. 

The education provided at the colleges was designed for adults and free of charge which made it possible for the common man or woman to attend courses despite scarce means. Not only subjects as reading, writing, math, English and other traditional were taught, but also useful knowledge as simple constructions of houses, needlework, and cattle keeping.

In the 1990's the Ministry of Education in Tanzania withdrew all endowments to the FDC: s. The government decided to provide capital only for salaries and wages for teachers and staff at FDC: s. To be able to continue running courses, inauguration of school fee was required at each college. The school fee of 25 000 Tanzanian Shilling, is equivalent to 250 Swedish Crowns. To a Swede this is a rather small amount of money whereas it is actually more than three months salaries of a petty farmer in this destitute country. 

The issue in need to be discussed is: should the introduction of school fee at FDC: s in Tanzania be countenanced?

The main argument against the school fee is that it prevents people from attending courses that actually were created for them. The illiterate population thatnreally is in need of education consists of indigent people with no means, in other words they are not able to pay the amount of money required for the education. Therefore the school fee erase the last possible chance for these people to get what they really need most of all: education.

My personal stand is that the introduction of school fee has in deed made it impossible for many people to study, but more important, it has in fact resulted in benefits for the target group mentioned above. Even though that was not the intention of the government, the quality of the education at FDC: s has actually improved. As a result of paying school fee, participants in the courses are today in a position to insist upon quality in their education, which was entirely unthinkable prior to the capital-withdrawal. 

The fact of the matter is that participants today are also having a much broader education than their precursors. School fee has indirectly created a stiff competition between the FDC: s that have managed to uphold their activities, and ingenuity is now necessary at the local education authorities. Courses need to be attractive and out of the ordinary in order to entice people to attend. 

An other argument in favour for the school fee is that it has actually encouraged the participants to demand more of their studies than solely traditional subjects like math, English and social studies. Current time more liberal and modern subjects are wanted such as politics, mechanics, electricity and nutrition. 

By requiring school fee, FDC: s in Tanzania have managed to obtain a certain cachet. They are now comparable to any other pedagogic institute and that appeals to both potential participants and teachers. Former students at FDC: s are proud of the kind of education they have managed to get and their community also regards them as successful citizens. 

I am entirely convinced that the introduction of school fee at FDC: s in Tanzania should be countenanced, as no argument is strong enough to overturn the actual benefits of the new income system. The education provided at the FDC: s today has improved in quality and variety as a result of participants gaining more influence on the courses. The achievement of co-determination is intimately related to the required school fee at the FDC: s and as well a consequence to the government decision to withdraw all endowments.",0
240,3033.a2.txt,Anna Lindh - out on a limb A member of parliament trying to impose regulations without public support or understanding,"People in the northern part of Sweden often complain about having rules and regulations imposed on them from above. ""The southerners"" are accused of not understanding how life is and how things work up north. This might not be true, but I will try to describe one situation where personal prestige has interfered in the making of new laws. The legislation I will discuss is concerning snowmobiles and especially the requirement of a driving licence. 

Snowmobiles are a natural mean of transportation and recreation up north. They are used to get access to remote and desolate parts of the scarcely populated northern part of Sweden. Quite naturally they are also used to get around the parts near the tourism-based villages, which has led to confrontations. On one hand we have tourists wanting to get away from the noise filled cities to experience silence. On the other hand we have locals who think that their needs should be of more importance, since they live there the whole year and not just for a week. But the problem is even more intricate; we also have tourists wanting to drive snowmobiles versus forest and reindeer owners whose work get impaired by reckless snowmobile drivers. Another side of the story is the accidents caused by intoxicated drivers. In the light of these conflicts and problems the Swedish government started talking about some regulations, and one of them was a driving licence. (Up until then the only requirement on a snowmobile driver was that he/she had obtained the age of 16.)

Precautionary measures were taken by the ""Swedish snowmobile society"" and they invented a kind of ""voluntary licence"". To acquire one of those licences you had to attend to ten two-hour lectures/discussions where, among other things, information from the police about what's allowed, traffic rules and how and where to drive were parts of the course. The course became a big success among the northerners with several thousands of participants, and the general opinion was that ""we better do this so the southerners don't impose something completely ludicrous on us"". Unfortunately it didn't work. 

A member of the Swedish government, Anna Lindh, (perhaps needless to say a southerner) decided that it was time to regulate and legislate. The logical thing would have been to make the ""voluntary licence"" compulsory, but since the licence hadn't been part of her original proposal, it wasn't included. Instead she proposed that to be allowed to drive snowmobiles you would have to have a driving licence for tractors! (In Sweden you are automatically considered able to drive tractors if you have any driving licence, but you can obtain a special driving licence for tractors from the age of 16, if you take a theoretical test.) People found it quite absurd that knowing things like ""no tractors on the freeway"" would qualify you to drive snowmobiles, and appealed the decision to the EEC. The legislation was rejected, grounded on that a driving test must have relevance to the vehicle you will be allowed to drive. 
One would think that now the ""voluntary licence"" would take the tractor licences place, but it didn't. Instead snowmobiles were moved (along with other vehicles) from ""terrain vehicle"" to a subclass of ""work vehicles"". Then the EEC could no longer oppose to the legislation. This created massive protests among the northerners, and delegations from all over the north were sent to Stockholm to try to stop the new set of laws. They failed.

The new set of laws included a lot of insanities. You were not allowed to drive more than 70 km/h, but everyone who has ever driven a snowmobile knows that it is very hard to drive more than 30 km/h for any longer period unless you are on a big flat surface like a lake (where you have free vision). And how are you going to check that people keep the speed limit? Are you going to send helicopters to patrol the vast Swedish mountain range? Or post policemen behind randomly selected trees? 
Engine performance was maximized to 60 hp (when imported but not when used) even though the highest risk of getting killed or injured in a snowmobile accident is when a 30-50 year old, intoxicated male is driving a 10-15 year old snowmobile with less than 40 hp. 
This above means that a person who might not even have driven a car in snowy conditions, is allowed to rent and drive a snowmobile without any other qualification than a passed car driving test and no requirements of knowing where and how to drive. But a 16 year old northerner, who has obtained the ""voluntary licence"" and therefore knows the ""how and where"" and most probably also knows ""why"" is not allowed to do it. 

As I see it, this is a tragic example of what happens when a person invests too much time in something and when something better comes along, cannot accept it and adopt, or at least incorporate the new idea. Personal prestige should be excluded from politics, but politicians are (unfortunately?) only human...",0
241,3035.a2.txt,TO RECEIVE THE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS MEANS TO DESERVE IT BY WORKING IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR,"There are nearly 9 million inhabitatnts in Sweden and about 277 000 of them are the unemployed. Benefits totally granted by the government are 32 633 000 Swedish crowns and maximum daily benefits are 580 Swedish crowns for one person (according to the ""Statistical Yearbook of Sweden"" by Statistics Sweden /SCB - Statistiska Central Byr√•n/, year 1998). Look at this sums of money! Isn't it incredible?! Is it fair to pay people to do nothing or to be busy only with some private things? In my opinion people receiving unemployment benefits should be required to do work in the public sector, that means at the industries and services in a country that are owned and run by the government. They have to deserve it! I am going to argue for this assertion doing some kinds of analyses and reasoning.
First of all what kind of categories one can find among the unemployed. It is the age category, sex category and some sub-groups which I'm going to write about in my article. It was very intersting to know that there are five groups of the unemployed according to their ages: from 16 up to 64. Representatives of each group can be very useful at the working place. But if you'll look at the age group from 25 up to 44, you'll see that it is the most numerous - 135 thousands of people (from 277 000)!!! That is nearly a half of all the unemployed in Sweden! Everybody understands, I hope, that at the age of maturity people have their experience of life, can do a lot, can reason, understand many economical aspects and have their own children. Most of them, I suppose, know what they want to do or to work with and how. Certainly it's nearly impossible to satisfy all their requirements but if they should be obliged to do some work in the public sector, they should be the most effective workers and may be the best and most rational helpers at the working-places, taking into account foregoing description of that ages.
According to the statistical facts, taken from the previously mentioned book, there are 154 thousans of men and 123 thousands of women among those 277 thousands of the unemployed in Sweden. One can see that the amount of the unemployed men is 32 thousands higher than the amount of the unemployed women. Isn't it a paradox? But let's say that minimum 50 % of all the unemployed are healthy and able- bodied. Both men and women could be very useful in doing all kinds of work in the sphere of the municipalities (kommun). We mustn't forget that most those people have either special education or profession and supposed to be good specialists. If they should be required to work in the public sector one could observe quite different way of making the job. I speak about more determined and rational actions of men to contrast with more gentle, perceptible and careful attitude of women to their job, which are equivalently useful for our society. 
Now I want to continue analysing that ""healthy and able-bodied men's and women's"" group of the unemployed receiving social benefits because inside of it I can observe some sub-groups as: a) that really wants to find some work and receive unemployment benefits; b) that wants to work but do not receive unemployment benefits for some reason or other; c) that does not want to work but receive benefits anyhow; d) political immigrants and foreigners. I am absolutely sure that people of all these groups should be required or may be even obliged to do work in the public sector because each of them is payed (maximum) 580 Swedish crowns a day, as it was mentioned before. So much is payed an ordinary low-payed worker for that work he (she) does during the eight-hour's working day!!!
In conclusion I want to say that the society could have a lot of the positive results if the analysed groups of the unemployed should be required to do work in the public sector. Working and being among people, creating social contacts can help a person to find the stable work-place, determine the interests, feel himself (herself) more self-confidently, find new friends and may be even a life- partner, receiving simultaneously the unemployment benefits from the government deservedly and that is of no small importance. I think it should be an idea to create a well-functioning unit by the Employment Office (Agency), Municipalities and the Social Services for coordinating if such placement in a job of the unemployed that receive the unemployment benefits.

242,3036.a2.txt,NA,"It has been stated that role-playing teenagers risk loosing contact with reality. This is said to lead to mental and spiritual crises and even suicide. Other critics are of the opinion that role playing can result in increased violence. Different religious groups say that the imaginative religions that are part of the game may lead to occultism and psychological disturbances.
My opinion is that role playing is, not only harmless, but actually good for you and that it should be encouraged. 
First of all we need to distinguish between role playing and other games that look similar but have a very different purpose.
There are two types of role playing: lives, which can be compared to a play where the participants are the actors. You know which role you will play, but you don't know what the action will be like. 
The second type is conversation games which takes place in the players imagination. The leader of the game tells the players what their surroundings look like. The players then choose how to act. 
It is the ability to enter another character that makes the role playing special. You need to get to know the role you are to play and to know how this ""person"" will act in different situations. In conversation games you will also have to imagine the landscape surrounding your character.
This is role playing. It may contain violence, but the aim of the game is never to kill the other players. More often you need to cooperate to succeed. Often you'll find that diplomatics and tactics will get you further than violence.
Other games that are sometimes confused with role playing are paintball, laser-tag and killer games. In these games the aim is to kill all the other players.
Most of the time role playing games mirrors problems from the real world in a fantasy or science fiction surrounding. This offers a nice background for discussing moral problems and solving logical puzzles. There are no easy solutions to problems and you have to use all your imagination and creativity to tackle them. A good strategy will help you in a fight and a clever scheme may keep you out of one. 
Role playing doesn't differ much from reality. There is violence in role playing, but every action has its consequences. You will never learn, as you may do from action movies, that the easiest way to deal with a problem is through violence.
There have been many stories about teenagers who commit suicide when something goes wrong in the game. After some investigation most of these stories proved to be untrue and that the persons in question didn't even exist. In all the other cases there where other more likely explanations. Thousands of people attend lives or play conversation games and like every major activity it has its percentage of persons with psychological problems. It is possible that role playing may act as a trigger, but there is a difference between triggering something and causing it. 
The religions that are part of the imaginative society in a role-playing game are almost always copies of different religions in the real world. The contact with them can be no more dangerous than religion classes in school or reading antic myths or faerytales. 
Everything in our surrounding influence us. Everyday we are exposed to a million different impressions. There is no way for us to know exactly how these impressions will influence everyone of us. So far there is no evidence that role-playing should be bad for you, only speculations. What is perfectly clear though, is the good sides of role-playing. 
Role playing is a social activity; you have to be at least one player and one game leader. It promotes imagination and creativity as stated before. You will need the ability to make quick decisions and to find solutions to problems.
Statistics tell us that intelligence among role players is above average.",0
243,3037.a2.txt,"Democracy, a delusion? A short critique of present-day liberalism","Introduction
Once democracy was considered a tool for changing people's hard life conditions to the better. It was seen as the ultimate instrument to attain political power from the ruling classes. To be allowed to vote was one of the primary goals in the working class struggle for social justice.

It has been more and more apparent that democracy has lost its attraction as a means of fighting against injustices in society. Democracy has nowadays proved to be a very insufficient method to achieve and fulfill what people need and wish to become true.

Why is that so?
Maybe a hint to the answer could be found at Marshall Berman, the author of the book ""All that is settled and established evaporates"", where he discusses the conditions of life in modern society. His main point and leading idea is that ""the dynamics of modern economy, and the culture that emerges from this economy, annihilates everything it creates - physical environments, social institutions, metaphysical ideas, artistic visions, moral values - in order to continue its creation, with the purpose of incessantly recreating the world."" ""This striving is pulling all modern men and women into its circle and will thus force us all to struggle with what is essential, meaningful and real in the whirl in which we move and live.""

What is then ""The Good Life""? A human being needs to live in a generous social context all his life in love and fellowship. He or she might also need to develop and create freely, both intellectually and artistically. However, the basis for all this is what nature offers to man, if it remains unspoilt: Fresh air, clean water, nutrients, food, clothes, housing, warmth and shelter, and possibly a means of transportation as well as medical cures and medicins. In a market economy material products could be bought, if enough money is available but only then.

The details of what ""The Good Life"" is likely to be, may be disputed, but I want to argue that ""The Good Life"" is approximately the way I have just pictured, and that the premises of this good life is endangered if not spoilt by the system we have to live in. 

Does the present economic and political system allow for a realisation of ""The Good Life""? What social relations follow from the working conditions? Do they contribute to ""The Good Life"" or do they on the contrary counteract the realisation of man's self fulfillment. During some decades after the great depression in the beginning of the 1930's, the economic growth had hardly any earlier equivalent and the social change was enormous after the preceding decades with the full emergence of democracy.

Democracy in crisis
From the 1970's onwards it has become evident that the institution of democracy has suffered heavily from successive degradation, as a parallel and simultaneous process to the deregulation of markets and the breaking up of what was called the ""welfare state"". The democracy institution is more and more falling short when it comes to the remedy and relief of human suffering, poverty and social exclusion, a constantly growing segregation, ill-health and lacking well-being as well as growing social isolation. It is increasingly impossible to get rid of politicians that persist in implementing harmful policies. Politicians and other important decision-makers cannot be held responsible with the help of the ballot-paper. People in general have to resign as mere lookers-on, passive witnesses to the present degeneration of politics. The result is stress, frustration, illness, crime, drug abuse and a gigantic environmental disaster.

Other manifestations of this decay of politics and democracy is the dismantling of the pension system and different social insurance systems. People have paid for their pensions and other social security benefits during their whole professional life and are now deprived of the fruits of their hard labour. Instead they are now requested to pay a second time by means of private insurance systems. We are also expected to play Russian roulette with our pityful rests of the state pensions on the stock market! 

The decadence of politics is also espressed in the tax system. While decision-makers feather their nests at people's expense, every serious attempt to save money is hampered by new and increased tax duties. The state has a ravenous and almost unlimited appetite and people are thus forced to work like mad to earn their living.

I contend that ""democracy by now is dead"" in the sense that it would be an instrument for real improvement of all the shortcomings that is inherent in the present political and economic system. The programs of the political parties have converged into a limited set of empty dogmas that, when brought into practice, seem to entail no responsibility concerning their consequences. To cut down inflation and reduce politics to nonsense stereotypes on television appear to be the common denominator for the political parties. The parties on the right-wing call for ""freedom of choice"" and ""tax reductions"", but they carefully avoid to discuss how poor people would be able to finance their pensions, health insurances, loss of income insurances, dental service insurances and all other necessary insurances that less poor people consider indispensable. The socialdemocrats and their political supporters of different colours are on the other hand presenting another formula, ""Public medical service, eldercare and school resources"", but the problem seems to be the same: How will it be possible for low-income people to save enough money for their living, when the enormous taxes and charges undermine vital savings. The so-called citizen is squeezed in a Moment 22: The more he or she is trying to save, the faster the savings are eroded. The less he or she is able to keep, the more they will fall down into dependence of the whims and fancies of the state or wither away into the faceless flock of political cattle. Whatever party the man in the street is voting for, he is voting against himself. In exactly this meaning democracy is well on the way of dying. There are no obvious political alternatives to the present neo-liberalism, even though the rhetoric may differ in the parliament and elsewhere.

The gap between the reality of your own wallet as well as your own life conditions and the empty stream of words that flow out of the politicians' mouths is widening with a terrifying speed. In Encyclopedia Britannica modernity is depicted as follows: ""Since its inception, modernity has worn two faces. One is dynamic, forward-looking and progressive, promising unprecedented abundance, freedom and fulfillment. The other, equally visible face is grim, revealing the new problems of alienation, poverty, crime and pollution.""

What does this Janus-face-description stand for? Already in 1776, when Adam Smith had his Wealth of Nations published, the foundation was laid for the theory that ""the mechanism of the invisible hand"" will eventually lead to the best of worlds, as long as each individual strived the hardest he could for his own good. Is this really a good theory? It rather seems as if ""the mechanism of the grabbing hand"" is the root of the modern world.

Modernity implies a job splitting process that has developed to the degree that people more and more live in subcultures, despite the revolution of the massmedia and the information technology. The greater the number of subcultures and the more different they are from one another, the more alien people might become before each other. The question is, if irresponsibility and indifference follow from this process and what the consequences are regarding democracy. What happens to people when they aren't able anymore to understand other people and feel the way they do? It is almost as when an air-craft pilot in battle fires-off his bomb-load by simply pressing his button. He will never see the direct consequences of his action and therefore possibly loses his ability to feel pity for his victims. In somewhat the same position the powerful people find themselves in modernity as well as their theoretical liberal strategists within the political and economic disciplines. 

A restoration of democracy would call for a revival of empathy and a renewed ability to denominate ""the actors of the world scene and its course of events"" in a true way. The schizofrenic split between the theory and praxis of liberalism of today is, I venture to say, one of the most fatal questions of the future of mankind.",0
244,3040.a2.txt,Abortion - a question of human freedom,"To have the freedom to decide for your self, over your own body and life. Not all people have the ""right"" to do so. This is depending on where you live and/or what religion you belong to. Unfortunately this leads to people having abortions illegally, or in some cases they give birth to the baby and then abandon it. All people must have the right to chose for them self if they should have an abortion or not. Though it should be under control and not be used as a contraceptive.

Abortion is not accepted all over the world. In the United States of America there have been wild discussions between Republicans and Democrats if abortion should be allowed or not ( right now it is allowed in the States). I think it is a human right to decide over your own life, if you want to have the baby or not. 

There should be no such thing as becoming pregnant and then have an abortion just because you do not care about using some kind of protection. But accidents happen; some see it as a great opportunity to keep the baby with the excuse it just happened. But there are also those who do not want a baby, are unable to care for a child, feel that there is not enough money to give the child a proper life. Most important though is that both persons involved agree on whatever decision they make. 

Here in Sweden we are lucky that it is fairly accepted and legal to have an abortion. It provides a freedom to the people, especially women. 
Lately there have been, in Sweden, many women who have an abortion because of their economic situation. Of course that is a very important aspect, it is very important to know that you are able to give the baby the support it needs. No one should be forced to bring a baby to the world if they feel they are not able to take care of it. Abortion can help a lot of people.

Pregnancy, as I mentioned above, is not always planned. You really have to consider the consequences, taking the responsibility. If it was not legal to have an abortion there would be many cases of illegal abortion, and also unwanted children brought to life. No child should be brought to the world ""without"" parents. There have to be an agreement between the two, no woman should be forced to have a baby if she really don't want to, but she can't neither force the man to support the child if he really don't want to have a baby.

There are not only these things as mentioned above that can be the reason for wanting to have an abortion. Today we have modern medical equipment that makes it easier to, in a rather early stage, examine the foetus and discover if there are any problems. Some babies are born with major heart failures, CP-injuries etc. Many of these problems we have medicines and equipment to handle. Though sometimes some are more serious than other, some incurable. In these cases parents also have a good opportunity to choose if they want to keep the baby.

As mentioned, abortion is not legal everywhere. There are many countries that according to law it is forbidden to have an abortion and in many religions too. Even though you are carrying the baby of a rapist... Some people consider it murder to have an abortion. I would say it is not murder but common sense. In many parts of the world we have overpopulation, which is not always due to restrictions about abortion. But I think it can be more regulated if abortion was allowed in some countries. 

Unfortunately, as mentioned, it happens that women accidentally become pregnant. Although we have so many different kinds of protections to chose from. Abortions should of course never be considered as a contraceptive, but has to be accepted to help out in certain situations.

Finally, abortion should be something that every person, all over the world, should be able to consider. No matter what country or religion, there always have to be the possibility to control your own life. There should be no children brought to the world ""without"" parents.",0
245,3041.a2.txt,Petrol- and diesel prices,"Why is the truckdrivers protesting in Europe for lower fuel prices? It is because they are so conservative. They do not realise that we can not go on like this on the same way in a system that is destroying the nature, animals and our human life. We are therefor in a good situation to change the worldpicture of petrol- and diesel consumption, into a more environment friendly direction. If we will safe the nature, we have to decrease the trucks on the road. There are better and much more energy-saving alternatives like railway and ferry service. The trucks we have to use could run on alternative fuels.

From the vegetable- and the animal kingdoms come the alternative fuels. These fuels can be methanol, ethyl alcohol and rape oil. The advantage with these substances is that they come from the ground and is a part of an ecological system. In an ecological system the plants take up substances from the air, which is then returned to the air again when we are using the plants as fuel, in the state of exhaust gas. These exhaust gases exist of substances that new little plants pick up, so they can grow and flourish, and these plants are used as fuel and the circle is completed.

Plants

Nourishment for the plants Fuel 

Exhaust gas 

More people should use alternative fuels to their cars, but they do not buy a car with 90 horsepower engine. They buy instead cars that have a 220 horsepower engine, because many people have their car as a status symbol. I think they do not care about the nature and animals when they are driving their big cars, so they can afford to pay high taxes and they should not complain about the high prices on the fuel. The people that consider that they cannot afford high taxes can buy a car with a 90 horsepower engine and which is energy saving. 

Many thinks that petrol- and diesel prices mostly consists of taxes to the State, but the advantage with the high taxes is that we are able to get a good welfare state with better schools and hospitals. The other part of the petrol- and diesel prices that not consists of taxes goes almost unshortened to the Arabians and Norwegians. This money is never invested in Sweden again and the society gets no pleasure of this money. If we instead would produce our own fuel, like methanol, ethyl alcohol and rape oil, most of the money would remain in Sweden and it could led to new jobs, for example construction of houses, recently started companies, profitability for the farming. With the profitability for the farming we are going to get an open landscape with a great variety. 

If we want to have a landscape with many flowers and animals we have to stop using fossile fuels. Fossile fuels like petrol and diesel is not a part of any ecosystem. The sequence of this is that the earth is filled with many toxic substances. This overwhelming of substances leads to acidification of oceans and lakes, the greenhouse effect, death of forests and affection on people like heart- and lung diseases. 

Thanks to the high fuelprices people maybe realise that we are going to destroy the nature and ourselves. One alternative to reduce the destroying and save some money is to travel together to the job. If many people are going by public transport it is going to be much cheaper. The advantage with public transport is that the cars in the city decrease and the accessibility increase. The decreasing of cars makes the air cleaner and better for the people who live there. We would not need any six-lane motorways through our cities, and we could instead use these places to build natureareas, houses or something else we need.

At this point I have realised that we have to do something about our way of travelling. The fuelprice is higher than ever and people have now a reason to think. There were some people before who really cared about the nature and when they were going somewhere. Now it is more people who think about the economic situation when they travel. One rule that is good to follow is that: if you are going under 5 km, use the bike. If you are going over 50 km, use the train, and between these you can use your car. Try to think about this when you are going somewhere and this is good both for your economy and the nature.",0
246,3042.a2.txt,VISUALLY IMPAIRED PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO GO TO MAIN STREAM SCHOOLS,"It's society's responsibility to resource blind and partuall sighted pupils (I will from now on call both these groups visually impaired.) in such a way that they can go through main stream education. There is nothing wrong with a person's brain just because he or she lacks sight partually or completely. I'm going to bring up three reasons why I think it is of vital importance that a visually impaired child should never be put into non-integrated schools without any accessment or reason other than its handicap. Should it not work for any reason, for example if the child is multi-handicapped, then that child obviously should have the right to go to a special school that better can support its specific needs.

I'm firstly going to show some of the main differences between main stream education and non-integrated education.

Firstly, in main stream schools, the aim is to help the best pupils to move forewards, so the courses set high targets instead of focusing on teaching the classes only the easiest and most basic things in the different subjects. This means that the pupils sometimes can find school challenging, but challenges can be fun, and with the right support they can manage and get stimulated. This is of course the same for a blind or partually sighted pupil. There's no reason to assume that they can't cope. In integration, visually impaired children also get the chance to meet with the sighted world, which I will come back to later. That means that they get ambitious and interested in trying to do something stimulating in the future, something which will help them to develop themselves and their strengths and to expand their knowledge.

Secondly, if a visually impaired child goes to a main stream school, it mostly means that he or she can live at home instead of in an accomodation provided by the school. In non-integrated schools, the pupils often live together in a corridor. The staff substitutes their parents and the other children substitute brothers and sisters, as the school can be situated far from the pupil's home. The child perhaps only meets its parents a few times a year, so they don't get a chance to learn what real family life is about, which can cause several problems further on in their lives.

If the child is integrated, however, it gets to know its family and also other children who are not visually impaired. This of course widens their view of society and social life, and as they are raised in the integratedworld, they learn not to be scared of it.

Having explained the background, I will now talk about what this leads to in the future for a blind or partually sighted person.

A grade from an integrated school mostly means greater opportunities for studying at university or other sorts of higher education. Due to the fact that the child has grown up knowing how to stretch his or her intelligence instead of underestimating it, he or she will learn how far it's possible to go and that one actually can make a career in the sighted world. Having studied at for example a university, the visually impaired person can then get a well paid and stimulating job. The visually impaired person that has gone through main stream education knows that he or she is no different to others when it comes to living an independent life.

To sum up, I want to say that I believe that main stream education provides a better understanding of the outside world than non-integration. Visually impaired people who have gone to schools for sighted people all the way from the beginning get used to solving everyday problems that may occur in a society where everything isn't always specially arranged for a person who lacks sight partually or completely. Also, the more visually impaired people that go to main stream education, the more the sighted people will learn about what a visual impairment means, which will inevitably lead to fewer prejudice from the sighted people's side and viseversa.",0
247,3044.a2.txt,Swedish benefits from a membership in EMU.,"On the 24th of June 1994 Sweden signed a contract with the European Union, EU, which stated that Sweden would join the union on January 1 1995. 
This contract also means that Sweden is obligated to follow the different conventions that are part of the union. One of these conventions, called the Maastricht Convention, includes a project called EMU, European Monetary Union, which is an economic collaboration with the final purpose of introducing a common currency in EU by the year of 2002. 
Therefore we are, at least formally, obligated to join EMU. However, the Swedish government has not yet decided whether Sweden should join or not.
I think this is a mistake and a typical example of the government's all too cautious attitude in this question. I will give a few examples that I think speak very clearly in favour for a Swedish membership.

In my opinion, the most important reason is the fact that Sweden then will have a chance to get a larger influence on the future development of EMU as well as EU. If we choose not to join EMU, we will inevitably lose political power that will instead belong to the group of countries that already has the biggest influence, such as Germany and France.

Beside the increased influence, Sweden also gets a chance to contribute to a deeper integration between EU-countries. Sweden has a duty in helping EU remain an insurance against wars within Europe. If the whole EMU-project would collapse, it would weaken the European cooperation, which would also lead to a weakening of the whole idea of EU as a peace project. What I mean by this is that if EU succeeds in their plans to expand EU to include also the eastern countries of Europe, the risks of a civil war such as that in former Jugoslavia, would be considerably smaller, since it would be easier to discover and react to the problems in time.

One of the main arguments EMU opponent's uses is that they do not want the Swedish Krona to be changed to Euro. They feel that we should stick to our traditions and keep the notes and coins that the Swedish people are used to.
I can partly agree on their arguments when it comes to the economic part, because the Euro has not been very stabile since it was introduced by the beginning of 2000. I can understand that many people get anxious when they see how the Euro is developing, even though I think its just natural that a currency is a bit shaky on its first years. What I have a harder time understanding is the sudden care for the - what it seems - esthetic look at this issue. 
I think it would be tragic if our cultural heritage lies in the money, we shouldnt make a big issue about how the money looks since its just metal and paper, a tool to enable us to buy and sell things. 

Another common opinion among EMU-opponents is that the question should be decided in an election, since they are convinced that the Swedish people would vote against a membership. According to the latest surveys they may very well be right. I think an election might be a good idea, but I have a couple of doubts: first of all, if there were to be an election, it would probably just be an advising one, like it was in the EU-election. Secondly, the clumsy way the government handled the EU-election, by providing the Yes-side with way bigger resources could very well be repeated. 
That would lead to a huge displeasure among the Swedish people if the Yes-side won, and the election wouldnt be considered a fair one. 

In brief, the question whether or not Sweden should join The European Monetary Union is a very important one, but the way the Swedish government is handling it does not help the Swedish people at all. Since the positive sides of a membership in my opinion are way bigger, I think we should join. We have paid great money to be part of the European Union and think we should make sure to benefit from it.",0
248,3045.a2.txt,NA,"1. Introduction
The population of Sweden, and the population of other developed nations, becomes fatter. Because of that people get more sick and besides it costs a lot of money in public service. To change peoples attitude when it comes to food and training, in order to stop the development, is almost impossible. In this momerand I will argue in favour of pretty dramatical changes which are, according to my opinion, necessary to solve the problem. The most important thing is to encourage children and teenagers to become more active and therefore physical training at school must be a high priority. Adults in the working life also need exercise and training to stay as healthy as possible, and I suggest compulsory training during working-hours. 

2. Injuries
2.1 The physical and mental health of children and teenagers
If you are in a good physical condition you feel better both physically and mentally. A fat person or a person who is not in a good shape will always bump into a lot of situations were he does not feel comfortable. If you are in good shape it is easier to concentrate in school which leads to better results. The most important thing is that you like yourself and whatever people say, there is no one who wants to be fat. 
A fat person often gets a bad self-confidence because of his weight. To have a good self-confidence and to live in harmony is very important whatever you are supposed to do. You will always perform better if you feel good about yourself because of the mental parts but also because of a better physical condition. A big problem is that if a person get in bad shape the mood to go training gets even lower and it becomes an evil spirit. When you are young it is most important to have a good self-confidence. At that time you are vulnerable and then you have the best opportunity to build a self-confidence for the rest of your life. You do not have to be fat!

2.2 Adult people
When you grow up you will have lots of problems if your weight is to heavy. If you have been fat since you were young it will probably have characterised your life in a negative direction. Your body might be worn and the fact that you have lived as a fat person has probably lowed your self-confidence. With fatness comes problems with your legs especially your knees. Often it also leads to vascular disorder and problems with your heart. When it comes to work many people get problems with their back, they get tired and they don't have enough energy to do a good work. 

3. Measures
As I said in the introduction dramatic measures are necessary if we want to stop the negative development. In the first place I think we have to defend the physical training at school. When it comes to adults it is harder. You can't force an adult to train but I think that you can force the employer to facilitate training during working-hours.

3.1 More training at school
The training at school is very important. That is why it is unluckily that training at school is being reduced. I think we should have three lectures of training every week. Unfortunately there are pupils who feel uncomfortable when it comes to physical training at school. Many pupils even feel agony when they know that it is time for the training lecture. Here the teachers have an important function. I do not think the biggest problem is that pupils do not want to train but the problem is that they feel ashamed for them-selves. You cannot require that everyone shall be athletes but those who exercise regular will feel better and therefor their dislike of training lectures will disappear. 

3.2 More training at work
Many people have sedentary jobs or jobs which are monotonous and do not exercise in the spare time. The reason why many people do not exercise after work is because they have a lot of other things to take care of when they come home, things that they prior higher than their own health. The only solution to this problem has to be that the training can be done at work. Even among the adults should three times a week be suitable. I do not know exactly how this should be solved in practise, but some form of legislation is necessary. 

4. Conclusion
People are getting fatter, that is a fact. Fatness and overweight is bad for your health, that is also a fact. If we do not do anything or make changes that makes it even worse, for example reducing the physical training at school, it will become a large problem for the society. So, it is a fact that we got to do something. It cannot be hard to understand that exercise in school is extremely important. It should also be very good if people could train at their place of work. I know that you at some places of work have the right to train at working-hours but in those cases we are talking about maybe an hour a week. That is not enough!",0
249,3062.a2.txt,Can we trust the statistics?,"We read about it in newspapers and we are constantly bombarded by it in our everyday life. The statistics is everywhere around us in every possible way. It makes us buy things. It sets boundaries for us and our manners, if we wish to be considered normal. It's through the statistics we look at the reality for the statistics, itself, presents the reality. To think statistically has become so common, that we no longer are aware of the way it's controlling and affecting our lives.
What is statistics? It's a collection of methods that helps us make decisions at uncertain times, and it's used in handling different situations, which can be described numerically. In most cases involving business, personal affairs or scientifically generalizations, when it's hard to get complete information, incomplete information is being used.
There are certain effective techniques and methods, that help the statisticians to manipulate the results of an investigation and consequently to achieve their goal. The conclusion would be the statement: ""We can't trust the statistics.""
Here are some of the above-mentioned methods:
* The use of small numbers
* Misleading figures
* False correlations
* The use of manipulative tables
* Different ways of giving the average of something
For instance, when we read that 65% of the people are against something, we should ask, ""65% of what people?"" On TV-commercials they lie to us with help of the statistics. They use phrases like ""We had 12 people test our product and 11 of them recovered."" This is a very clever way of using the statistics. All the tests and numbers are true, but behind this truth a big lie is hidden. The secret is that they repeat the test with those 12 people, until they get the result they wished for. In this way, they can't be claimed to tell lies. They just didn't tell everything.
When we want to prove something, we prove something else and then we pretend that it's the same thing. Let's say that you have the patent for a cold-medicine that you want to do marketing for. You can't prove that this medicine cures a cold, but instead you can have a lab-protocol published, showing that certain amount of this medication killed 30000 bacteria in 11 seconds. You have to make sure the lab is well known. You'd better hire a doctor and have her/him confirm its power. Never mention about the kind of bacteria it killed.
We can't only look at the statistics, but we have to consider all the facts around it, which, as a matter of fact, give the statistics brighter perspectives. Specifically, it's been said that many more people have died in flying accidents in the 90's than 50's. Have the planes become worse? No, this can't be logical, because the technology and security have developed so much recently. The real reason is that it's more people flying today than then. Should we count the number of deaths in proportion to the passenger increase, we'd see that the number of deaths has shown a great decrease.
The average of something is worthless, unless we know its extent. In books for new parents it's said, ""Children are supposed to sit at a certain age."" If a child doesn't sit at that age the parents worry to death and fear that their baby is not normal. If the parents knew that 52% of children do it and 48% don't, they wouldn't worry much. 
Actually, it's quite unfair to blame only the statisticians for all the lies. Most of the time the manipulation occur on the way by others like salesmen, PR-people, journalists or advertisers, before it's reached people.
Finally, we can't ignore a very important factor in a statistical investigation: The factor of truth. How do we know whether the questioned people are telling the truth or not? We can't always count on people giving us sincere answers. They either don't take it seriously or they're too embarrassed to reveal certain things about themselves.
Every time we come across a piece of statistics, in order to measure its reliability we should ask: 1. How has the investigation been done? 2. Who is responsible for it? 3. Have the questioned people told the truth?
The methods I mentioned in my writing are usually used in advertisements or politics. It means that they are, unfortunately, very effective, otherwise they wouldn't be used...",0
250,3063.a2.txt,The Swedish purchase of Gripen fighter planes.,"Introduction
Sweden is right now in a process of upgrading the airforce with new Gripen fighter planes, which eventually will replace the old Viggen system. The idea of a new aircraft, to modernize the Swedish Airforce and later take over after Viggen, came in the late 70's. But it would take several years before the first prototype stood ready. The criteria was that it had to be smaller, faster, cheaper, lighter, harder to detect, with a better range and load capacity than Viggen. Another criteria was that it had to be nicer to the environment. After a lot of discussions and pie throwing, the contract for these new fighter planes to the Swedish Airforce were signed in 1982. The amount of aircraft in the order have been modified a few times and finally ended up at about 220 planes. The first operative division were placed at F7 in S√•ten√§s in 1993.
I think we needed this new Gripen system to replace the old Viggen, and to keep a modern airforce. Since Gripen is an instable aircraft it can turn in a smaller radii than most other aircrafts. And by instable I mean that it takes many cooperating computers just to keep the plane in the air, flying straight. 
In the future we might be able to use it in peacekeeping missions, maybe under the UN flag. In that case I think it would be reconnaissance missions, such as photographing strategic locations and troop movement. 
Since 220 planes are to many for the new military organization, we might be able to export the Gripen system to other countries and in that way make some money for the Swedish defense. South Africa have already bought a couple of fighters, and wemight have some other potential buyers in Austria and Chile, were we have been showing our new system. Austria have bought Swedish fighters before and they say that they are very pleased so far with the service and social contacts. As an answer to a possible counter-question I would say: -No, I don't think that every country who buy Gripen will use it for peacekeeping missions. But I still don't think that we, by exporting the Gripen system, encourage warfare and invasions. We only sell an airplane, not any special weapons, missiles or bombs for example. Those things they have to buy from other countries, just like we do, and that would be their job to stop unauthorized countries from buying these kind of weapons. I don't know if this is such a smart expression by the Swedish minister G√∂ran Persson, but this is roughly what he said during a press conference: ""If we don't sell fighter planes to them, they will get it somewhere else"". That might be true. And in this case Sweden doesn't have anything to lose; we have to many Gripen planes, so why not sell them instead of having them standing useless in a hangar.
This plane will last for many, many years to come, since you just have to maintain the body of the plane and then simply upgrade the software in it, such as the guidance system and flight system as a whole. This is pretty easily done since the Gripen planes consists of about 40 computers. Since this is such an advanced aircraft it must be limited not to do more than 9 G:s, because the pilots can't handle so much more and certainly they can not take as much G:s as the plane can. 
Due to all the crashes and delays many people think this whole project has become much more expensive than it was budget for, but they are so wrong. In reality, it became cheaper than expected. And since there have been a couple of crashes, people have had doubt about how good it really is. But, I say but again, almost every new airplane in the stage of development have crashed once or twice, because of so called teething troubles. You learn by you mistakes. Just look at the last Swedish system during development, Viggen, which made even more crashes than Gripen during it's first years. The first crash with the Gripen came when the pilot were going in for landing during the sixth flight. Another example is the American F-16 and the stealth fighter F-117, which have gone down a couple of times and still does.
Despite of the cost for the Gripen project, we still have a fairly modern defense in the army and navy. The navy has just got a new ship called YS2000 and a lot of new material have been bought in for the army. This might show the rest of the world that ""little Sweden"" can do it on our own.",0
251,3064.a2.txt,Gay parents are as good as any parents!,"In this essay I would like to discuss a very burning issue in today's political debate, the issue of gay adoptions. The most common argument as to why we should keep the legislation of today, which prohibits gay adoptions, is that it is in the children's best interest. Growing up with gay parents is considered harmful to a child. I am of the opinion that this is wrong. To show why I find it wrong I would like to take two examples of often used arguments as to why gay parents is a bad thing and discuss them. The two arguments I have chosen are the ones that I've found are most commonly used in the debate. The first is that a child needs parents of both sexes, so that it will have both a male and a female role model. The other argument is that a child with gay parents runs a much larger risk of getting bullied in school.
I will begin with the argument which most people consider to be the strongest: a child needs both a female and a male parent, since it needs role models of both sexes. I will not deny that a child is better off if it can find a role model of each sex, but I can't see why these role models necessarily have to be the child's parents. If a gay couple with a normal social network adopts a child it is true that the child will only find role models of one sex in it's parents, but then you have to consider that the parents are not the only adults in a child's environment. Almost every child has at least some uncles, aunts, grandparents and/or maybe godparents, not to mention teachers, friends, neighbours, etc. If I take my own childhood as an example I find that my female teachers in compulsory school were much bigger role models for me than my mother was. So what's actually important is that the parents have a normal social network, and of course that they give the child the love, care and attention that it needs. If the parents live up to that I don't think it will have any importance for the child's well-being if the parents are gay or heterosexual. An interesting thing in this context is that the Swedish government already have acknowledged the fact that a child does not need parents of both sexes, as singles are actually allowed to adopt. 
As to the other argument I can't agree to that a child with gay parents necessarily will be bullied in school. Children are actually much more broadminded than we think. If only the adults in school are open-minded, talk to the children, inform them and allow them to ask questions about it, I think that they will accept that some children has two mums or two dads. But when I say that children are broadminded I don't mean to say that bullying isn't a great problem in school. But what I don't think is that the real reason as to a child getting bullied is that it differs from other children. Instead I think that a bully chooses a victim which is easy to bully, i.e. a child that is shy, quiet, lonely and won't cause the bully any trouble. If this child differs from the others in any way, maybe by wearing glasses, having differently coloured skin, or having gay parents, this is often used by the bully as a excuse to make this child an outcast. But that doesn't mean that this is the actual cause for bullying. I would say that a very shy and lonely white boy with married heterosexual parents runs a much larger risk of being bullied than a talkative black boy that finds it easy to make friends and has gay parents. 
My conclusion is that a child won't take any harm from growing up with gay parents. As you have seen the two main arguments as to why the law against gay adoptions is in the children's main interest are very easy to dismiss, and therefore I hope that you will understand why I'm of the opinion that this law is an act of discrimination. It is a scandal that a law which is based only on prejudices and misunderstandings can exist in a modern and enlightened country like Sweden.",0
252,3065.a2.txt,The Government should have a responsibility when it comes to the health of children and teenagers!,"The new schedule for gymnastics in school, which the Government have agreed on, imply that children and teenagers will have less time for physical training and physical education during school hours. The new regulation also gave the board of each school a chance to decide for themselves if they wanted to make gymnastics a priority or not. A statistical survey now shows that inactivity during school hours has increased instead of decreased. Most four-year-olds love to play and to run around, but slowly they become sedentary teenagers. How did this happen and is this a development we want? I can find several reasons why the Government have to change its attitude to physical training and physical education in school. 
Today's society has changed which means that people in general and especially children and teenagers are less physically active than, say fifteen years ago. Today computers are more interesting than playing outdoors or going in for sports. Inactive children often become inactive adults when active children on the other hand often bring their interest with them throughout life. School is a source of encouragement and it's often there you lay the foundations of sports and athletics. Young people are getting so much good out of being active. They reduce the risk of getting illnesses like brittleness of the bones and different kinds of cancer. Physical training prevents people from gaining all kinds of diseases and sport activities increase health and lengthen life.
Students that are physically active and that practice regularly have higher grades in school. Children learn a lot of things during their time in school, which demand a high degree of concentration. Children perform much better and they have a greater ability to concentrate during a whole lesson and during a whole day of schoolwork. Children who have trouble sitting still manage this much better if they are active during the day. A school environment can be a stressful environment, as you probably have experienced yourself. Good physical condition influences stress in a good way, which make you handle different situations and problems satisfactory. Children also get aware of there own bodies in a way that often lead to better self-esteem and self-confidence. What is the use of producing children of genius if they don't have hearts, lungs and legs, which they can use properly?
Children and teenagers of today have, in general, more overweight than what the same age group had further back. The food children eat today is not always as good as it should be. Parents often don't have time to cook good and balanced food and they take an easy way out by bringing their children to Mac Donald's or buying pizza at the supermarket. Children need to learn more about nutritious food, but they also need more exercise to stay healthy with the kind of food they consume today. 
School has been an institution, which we have been proud of in Sweden. The Government have been taking the responsibility to give all children a good basic education where nutrition and physical training have been important parts. Children and teenagers should be provided with facilities and the opportunity to take part in daily programs of enjoyable exercise so that physical activity may develop into a lifetime habit. We must remember that children's inactivity today will lead to unhealthy grown-ups in the future. Diseases that are a result of bad health will become a great cost to society in many different ways. We already have people going regularly to physiotherapy and that group will become even larger in the near future. People will not be able to work because of heart deceases or vascular disorders. I believe it's unnecessary to let this happen. It's important to do something now, before the problems get unmanageable. I want the Government to think about this regulation one more time, thinking about the future.",0
253,3067.a2.txt,The West is responsible for environmental damage in developing countries,"The state of the environment is a hotly debated topic and a part of this discussion is if the West is responsible for the environmental damage of the world that takes place in the developing countries. People who claim that the West got nothing to do with the destruction in these parts of the world forget to take into consideration that the key factors of their destruction are demands and economical pressure from the West. As to make up one's mind about this you also have to take in to account that these countries have not got the same knowledge as the West.

It is often suggested by the media that the West is not responsible for the environmental damage that is taking place in the developing countries. Some people would argue that the fact that rainforests are being destroyed in Brazil is their responsibility not ours. The real situation is more complex. They cut down the rainforests on the strengths of demands from the West. We need material to be able to produce all gadgets and unnecessary stuff that we have in our society. The fact that we today have a threatening number of endangered species is a result of human beings will to own as much as possible. It is obvious that poaching would not exist to the same extent if people from the West did not buy coats, ivory etc. Destruction in these parts of the world is a direct consequence of demands from people in the West.

A major reason for destruction in developing countries is that many of them owe money to western banks. They need economic growth, whatever its environmental consequences, to pay back on these loans. Another example of economical reasons that makes the West responsible for the damage caused in the developing countries is that the West sell second-hand products to the developing countries. Boats, aeroplanes and things like that. And what happens when these enormous metal products are impossible to use any longer. Well the developing countries have not got resources to take care of it so they just leave them to rust. Is that not the responsibility of the West? Demands in society today have gone totally out of control and the major cause of it is avarice. Many western companies make a mint by selling products which have run out of date in developing countries. They would be sued if they tried to sell these products in a western country so to make earn as much as possible they just send them to a developing country. In Thailand provisions that had best before use date one year ago can be seen in the stores. There are also cosmetic products that had run out of date with as much as four years. 

As to make up one's mind about who to blame about the damage of the world in developing countries we have to take into account that there is a lack of knowledge in these countries. The problem is that they are not aware of what actually happens when we tamper with the environment. The West, on the other hand, know for example that the greenhouse effect is expected to lead to changes in climate with more frequent floods, droughts and heat waves. For example an urgent environmental concern like endangered species needs us in the West to educate people in developing countries otherwise it will result in consequences like extinction. Owing to the fact that we have this kind of knowledge we are definitely as responsible as they are, or even more, for the destruction that takes place in developing countries. 

To sum up, people who argue that the West is not responsible for the damages in developing countries are far too narrow-minded. It is clear that the destruction depend as much on our demands and pressure as on their misbehaviour. We should show less self-interest and educate them instead. According to what has been taken up in this essay it is quite wrong to suggest that the West is not responsible for environmental damage in developing countries, on the contrary, the West is the cause of it. On the whole everyone is responsible for protecting the environment, even you and I.",0
254,3068.a2.txt,Legal age for buying alcohol should be 18,"At the age of eighteen you are permitted by law in Sweden to drive a car, to vote and to take a loan at the bank. You are also legally responsible of your own actions, even allowed to get married, but you are not permitted to buy champagne to your own wedding. How can a person, who probably made the biggest decision in his or her life to love someone until death, not be old enough to have a glass of wine with some friends a Saturday evening? 
And how can it be that a country like Sweden treats a person as an adult from the age of eighteen on all areas except giving the freedom to buy alcohol? The law says that when you are eighteen you have reached a reasonable ripeness of judgement to handle the demands, which are connected to these. Obviously buying alcohol is not one of them. I disagree and state that buying and drinking alcohol should be legal at the same age.

1467 was the year when alcohol first came to Sweden. It was suppose to be one of the ingredients in the gunpowder production. In the beginning of 1900th century, alcohol was cheap and selling it was free. Never earlier or later have people been drinking so much as then. Men who had a physical hard job could get a part of the salary paid in alcohol. This entered into more drinking and injuries and less work. From 1917 the government controlled all import, export, buying and selling. The limited age for buying alcohol changed from 21 to 20 1969.

I do not believe that alcohol is good for the health or that alcoholism should be more acceptable. I know that there is a connection between an early debut in drinking and alcoholism even though in many cases it is something already in your genes, but I will argue against the laws we have in Sweden. I think it is wrong to separate drinking and buying. It gives it a double meaning, which can very easily be confused. The Swedish legal system is unique when it comes to the laws about alcohol.

Swedish drinking habits differs from many other countries in Europe. We do not drink every day, instead we drink a lot in the weekends. If we would hear about someone who drank daily we would all think he or she is an alcoholic. In France for instance it is a part of their culture to drink wine to the evening meal and drinking is seen as social thing and not as a dangerous threat to the young. In the States it is legal to drink at 21 but instead they face even bigger problems such as drugs. 

If we look at alcohol as a poison, something that is bad for your health and consequently made the laws based on that, smoking is just as damaging to you and to others and should also be treated with the same respect. 

The problem we face today, even though we have laws that do not permit buying alcohol under the age of 20, is that the alcohol consumption is higher then ever among youths and it is going even further down in age. Of all alcohol that the Swedish people drink 35% is privately distilled. It is not because it taste better, or because it has a higher percentage of alcohol that people drink it, but it is easy to get and a lot less expensive. Selling homebrewed liquor to teenagers should be followed by an unmerciful punishment, because for people under age this is usually their way to get liquor. If the legal age for buying alcohol was 18 and Systembolaget had complete monopoly, it would be under controlled forms and privately distilled would not be that attractive.

Alcohol creates alcoholism I defiantly agree on that, but it is not the access on liquor that makes alcoholism. Alcoholism is in many cases something that is in your genes, like a congenital desire. Alcohol is more about culture and what we learn when we grow up.
The majority of the population never becomes alcoholics therefore shall we not treat young adults as if they have not reached the level of awareness of the dangerous aspects in drinking. From the age of eighteen you are seen as an adult and should be able to make and take responsible decisions such as buying and drinking alcohol.",0
255,3072.a2.txt,Learning English at the Age of Six,"Younger Swedish school- children are not capable of understanding the English that surrounds them, unless they have a linguistic instinct and a large amount of interest or have very ambitious parents. The Swedish schools do not encourage English learning until grade four, when it becomes one of the basic subjects. This is something to be taken seriously.Children have the right to know some English, much earlier than what is the case today.
Nowadays, Swedish children are exposed to the English language long before they begin learning it in school. Television-cartoons and films, computer-games, pop-music, Poke'mon-cards and all sorts of toy-instructions are in English. They also meet English-speaking persons more often than older generations. Therefore, it is obvious that our children definitely have a need for English, at least passively, long before they learn the language in school.
The Swedish curriculum suggests that the schools teach English in a way that they can make use of the child's own interests and curiosity, such as pictures, music, moving around and creativity. There is not a set age, when the schools are obliged to start the English education. Most schools however do not begin properly until grade three or four.I would say that most teachers are not in the position to make use of their pupils' interests, since the teaching often starts in grade four. At the age of ten, pupils already have to know some basic English to manage to use their interests in language-learning. Therefore, it would be much better to introduce English as early as at the age of six. Then teachers and pupils can make use of the supply of English and American material for pre-school children, such as books, games, tapes and films. Consequently, one obtains interested pupils who practise English just because it is so much fun.To enjoy the subject is the best start in the process of learning a new language.Having received a keen interest in English, children can more easily get interested also inother cultures. They understand that Sweden is one small part of our big world and that new languages are nothing strange. 
Many teachers and parents think that children should learn one language at a time. They are afraid that they will get confused when they are introduced to English at the age of six.Their worries are certainly understandable, but many children are the proof that this is not the case. They are brought up in a bilingual environment, and they learn both languages. My brother in law's daughter, who is three years old, speaks Swedish like a four year old. She understands English and is in the state of beginning to use it actively. She is also surrounded by Arabic. At the age of three she has reached the point where she is able to distinguish the three languages and translate from English to Swedish when her both grandmothers talk to each other. She has a good ear for languages and her parents are indeed very much aware of the fact that it is important to work actively with giving their daughter all three languages.Not all children have this exclusive background, but at the age of six most Swedish children have such a good knowledge in Swedish that there is nothing dangerous in introducing a new language. Actually, at the age of six, children are very receptive to new languages, and they are not afraid of doing mistakes, like in pronunciation.
Some persons concerned with the preservation of the purity of Swedish want to protect our mother tongue from English influences. They want to keep it as it is. Swedish has however already been under the influence of several languages e.g. French and German. these influences are connected to our history.So Swedish is constantly evolving. Accordingly, we can never protect our language fully from the influences of other languages, but early English-learning is not the cause of the changing of the Swedish language. Instead this can raise awareness about distinguishing the two languages and it may lead to a deeper sense for the mother tongue. 
Applying my thoughts right into the teaching-system of today will probably not work. We need teachers comfortable with speaking English. A professional attitude is of importance. Working with younger pupils should demand almost as long university education as working with older ones. Although the main thing is of course that the teacher's knowledge is applicable to younger children.
Finally, I am looking forward to see the next generation having confidence in using English in Sweden or abroad earlier than our generation, and having the possibility to apply English to their interests. This can be the truth if we begin the English learning at the age of six.",0
256,4001.a2.txt,Abortion - a crime?,"Abortion is a burning issue these days, evoking many strong feelings. In Sweden there is a growing movement propagating for a law restricting the right to having an abortion, and consequently there is a simultaneously growing fear for such a law. Few people can honestly say they are indifferent to the matter. It is indeed a moral dilemma, and for a woman who is in the process of deciding whether to follow through with a pregnancy or to abort it, with or without support from the law, I'm sure it is terribly painful and difficult. But I am convinced that women should have the legal opportunity to end an unwanted pregnancy, and I will here argue in favour of this position

First of all it is a question of women's rights. A woman who goes through a pregnancy and becomes a mother is, physically and by means of social and cultural tradition, forced to make major changes in her lifestyle. Unlike the man, she cannot escape and disclaim her responsibility. Thus there is an inequality of opportunity between the sexes and the best way to solve this problem is to give women the right to choose. 

Of course I can't pretend to be unaware of the most obvious argument against abortions. I can fully understand those persons who feel an instinctive aversion to abortions. It is after all an extinction of what might have become a living human being. I want to very clearly point out that I do agree that abortions should be avoided to the greatest possible extent, and that they should definitely not be used as some kind of substitute for a contraceptive. But at the time of an early abortion the embryo is not capable of living by itself, so I think it is not unreasonable to call it a part of the woman's body and argue that she should have the right to make her own decisions about it. I also think it is important to consider what the alternative would be, that is, what would happen if abortions became illegal. 
It is not realistic to imagine that women would suddenly cease to find themselves in the situation where they do not want to carry through with a pregnancy. What I mean is that abortions would be carried out anyway, but under much more dangerous circumstances. Uneducated amateurs or quacks trying to perform the operation are likely to physically harm the woman, causing permanent injury or even death. In fact, thousands of women die from complications after illegal abortions every day throughout the world. If it comes down to a question of either aborting the pregnancy, extinguishing the embryo which isn't viable, and saving the mother, or having the abortion and at the same time risking a grown-up woman's life, I think the choice is not very hard to make. 
Obeying the law, that is, refraining from aborting the pregnancy, may also have disastrous consequences, not least for the child. Women in difficult life-situations may not have the economical, emotional or physical ability to take care of a child. Young women who become pregnant may simply not be ready to take the responsibility that is required for raising a child. A woman who has become pregnant after being raped may, for obvious reasons, not want to become a mother at that time. An unwanted child is likely to have to take the blame for its parent's unhappiness or to be neglected or abused, and lead a miserable life which it does not deserve. Innocent children have a right to be loved and cared for, emotionally and materially, and outlawing abortions would, I think, deprive them of this right.
These consequences of a prohibition of abortions are rather obvious and too serious to be ignored. It is therefore important to keep them in mind when discussing the matter.
Summarizing my views, I think that legislating against abortion would amount to a step in the wrong direction in the struggle for women's rights. It would also imply a direct danger to women's health if they break the law, and put the well-being of their children in jeopardy if they obey it. I think that these arguments are sufficient to show that the right to have an abortion should definitely not be removed.",0
257,4002.a2.txt,Raise the teachers' salaries!,"It is common known that today's Sweden, to a great extent, lacks qualified teachers. All too few teachers are being educated, and many who are certificated teachers choose to work elsewhere than in school. This should not be a surprise though, as both their status and salaries are low in comparison with other academics. If you in addition to this, consider how rough the teachers' working conditions are today, it is obvious that something has to be done to change their situation. It is absolutely necessary to raise the teachers' wages, in order to give them a salary that corresponds with their assignments, and make the profession attractive again. But is it then so hard to be a teacher? I claim that it is, and in this essay I'm going to try to convince you, that the teachers' salaries are much too low in addition to their contemporary working conditions.
The teaching profession has always been demanding. Teachers have always been expected to do a lot of extra work that not has been included in their scheduled working hours; lessons have had to be prepared and written tests and essays corrected. And today the working burden has become even heavier. A teacher's job is not any more only to make sure that its pupils pass their examinations and keep calm in class. Humanity and individualism have become a part of the Swedish schools, and even though this of course is positive, it has increased the pressure on the teachers. 
Today, evaluation of the individual pupil's development and progress is a part of the learning process. The teacher has to organize conversations between teacher, parents and child regularly. This is not only taking a lot of the teacher's time with a lot of planning required and meetings have to be taken place in the evenings, but the closer contact with the parents also puts psychological pressure on the teacher. It is supposed to make all parts comfortable in the delicate situations that can arise when children's skills are being discussed.
However, the teacher's role as a psychologist doesn't stop at these specific situations. In its daily work, the teacher are supposed to catch all pupils' interest at the same time, and be able to handle all their different needs. Many pupils require extra attention and help and make this a difficult task. The teacher feels that it is not enough. Assisting teachers for pupils with special needs are rare and the teacher can't be there for everybody all the time. In a time when the classes are growing bigger this is getting even harder. Politicians seem to think that teachers are magicians. With less money, fewer lessons and more students, they are supposed to be doing miracles and reach a higher ambition level.
The teachers' responsibilities do not either end with education in the form of school subjects as math and English. The teacher is an adult with whom the pupils spend their whole day, to which the small children look up to and imitate. It becomes a part of its students' upbringing, whether it likes it or not. The school is a social community, where children learn to act among other people than their family. And the school of today is not an easy world to live in. The teacher is supposed to guide the pupils through the jungle of social and emotional problems that can arise in school. It is supposed to discover if a child is feeling bad, if it is being treated badly in school or at home. The lack of welfare officers makes this task even harder. 
But it is not only a question of children being treated badly and feeling bad at school. Today the school is not a safe place to be, for teachers as well as for pupils. An increasing number of students bear guns and bully their teachers. In many schools the pupils are ""taking over the classrooms"" and teachers are afraid of going to their jobs.
As you can see the teachers' working conditions are hard. They are supposed to act both as mentors and psychologists, but do only get paid for teaching. They have great responsibilities and it is time that they are being rewarded for that. They must feel that they are appreciated, so that they will have the strength to improve the Swedish schools.

258,4003.a2.txt,Why the paragraph that regulates the right to claim for damages ought to be revised,"In theory, in Sweden, even a burglar is able to claim for damages if getting injured on private property. This is morally and ethically wrong and something needs to be done to make it impossible. 

If a burglar, for instance falls and breaks a leg due to the owner of the house having omitted to sand his/her icy driveway and doorstep during a cold winter, the housebreaker can thus claim for damages from the person(s) responsible for keeping the driveway safe, the very person(s) the burglar attempted to steal from. Maybe a thief is about to break into a house through the roof hatch and one of the steps on the ladder snaps causing him to fall to the ground and get hurt. Say that someone is trying to break in through a window but the hinges are so rusty that the window falls out and cuts the thief badly, making him bleed so heavily that an ambulance is needed, should the owner then have to pay the thief damages for his sufferings? 

It 's not very likely that a person who has entered someone elses premises with committing a crime in mind, would risk giving him- /herself away by turning to the legal system in order to claim his/her so called rights. Nevertheless it's still appalling that it is in fact possible. My opinion is that it shouldn't even be feasible in theory for someone with criminal intentions to make capital out of the property owners unability or neglect to keep the house and yard/garden up to a certain standard. 

Even if it is desirable that the grounds are safe to anyone who might enter it, an individual should have the right to decide over his/her own property. The case might also be that the weather has been variable with snow and minus degrees, then thaw with a following cold snap turning the driveway into an ice-rink over night. This can make it difficult to keep up with the sanding for instance. The owner might not even deem it necessary since he/she is aware of the problem and therefore take precautions. 

One might also think that if you enter someones private property, you do it at your own risk, especially if you are uninvited. 

Some might argue that the uninvited person falling on the icy driveway may be the childminder bringing your sick child home, or that the person falling from your roof is the chimney - sweeper. Shouldn't these honest people have the right to expect being able to perform their duties in a safe environment? Shouldn't they have the right to claim for damages if they are injured on your property? Yes they should! This means that the discussed right must remain included in the law but the fact that it's possible for a criminal to benefit from it and recieve money for getting injured in the above described situations, indicates that the paragraph needs to be revised. Although it might be considered difficult to write a legal paragraph that excludes persons with shady intentions, without violating the rights of the general public. Another problem is to be able to prove that this person who got injured on your doorstep was in fact there for suspicious reasons. One can only hope that this right doesn't apply to people on the way out from your house, carrying off your new stereo in their arms while slipping. 

Can you then call a person who hasn't yet committed a crime a thief or a burglar? Yes I believe you can if he/she went there with the intentions of stealing, if he/she brought tools to use for breaking and entering, if he/she happends to get injured before accomplishing the theft is beside the point, he/she is still a criminal and should thus not benefit from the right to claim for damages. One might even go so far as to say that it serves the burglar right to break a leg for trying to break the law. Maybe an icy driveway could be considered an excellent safeguard to prevent someone from walking of with your valuables.",0
259,4004.a2.txt,Unemployment jobs,"Unemployment is an enormous problem in our society. But its not just a problem to society; above all its a problem of utmost importance to those affected by unemployment. Unemployment affects thousands of our citizens, not just the people who are unemployed, but their families and friends as well. The time has come to do something about this problem. There is a solution that is as simple as it is ingenious: unemployment jobs. 

It seems appropriate to begin this report on unemployment jobs with a definition of what they are. An unemployment job is a job in the public sector that is created to give work to an unemployed person. A person who has a job of this kind is called unemployment worker.

There are several reasons why we should create unemployment jobs. First of all, unemployment benefits arent of benefit to anyone. They are a burden to society. We spend a large amount of the taxpayers money on unemployment benefits, but we dont get anything in return. At the same time they are a burden to the unemployed who become passive by receiving money without being expected to do anything at all. They often feel betrayed and rejected by society and cant see any possible way to change their situation.

Secondly, unemployment jobs will be an effective means of reintroducing people into society. They will get used to get up in the morning and go to work. The feeling of doing something important will make them proud of their achievements and will boost their self-esteem. This will help them to find employment elsewhere, which is of course the main aim of this reform.

Furthermore, society will benefit from the unemployment jobs. The previously unemployed are going to give something back to society; thus everyone will gain something as a result of the unemployment jobs. Its a well-known fact that the public sector is suffering from a great lack of manpower at present. This shortage is particularly acute in schools and old peoples homes. Unemployment workers will be of great assistance in these fields even if they havent got any formal education. For instance, an educated teacher will of course have the main responsibility for teaching his or her class, but an unemployment worker can help the pupils with their assignments. He or she can also help the teacher with keeping discipline in the classroom. Pupils will benefit from more adult help and a calmer school environment, more suited to effective learning.

In order to make a success of this reform, introductory instruction will be available to unemployment workers and they will of course not get tasks they are incompetent to execute. They will also be given the opportunity to choose where they want to work when this is possible. Unemployment workers will be given time off to go to job interviews as well. To encourage the unemployed to participate, the salary for an unemployment job will be higher than the unemployment benefit is today while the unemployment benefit will be somewhat lowered.

There are critics saying that we are going to create unnecessary jobs just to keep everyone occupied and that the unemployment jobs are the kind of jobs that no one would take if he or she had a choice. As mentioned above, these jobs are very important. It is true that the unemployment jobs arent the most prestigious and popular jobs available, but we must remember that these jobs are supposed to be temporary. The reform is aimed at helping the unemployed back into the ordinary labour market, not to create a second one just to fill the need of the public sector. An added bonus to this reform is that there will be a number of ordinary jobs created in addition to the unemployment jobs since the unemployment jobs has to be administered and supervised.

Finally, the need for unemployment jobs has to be emphasized. They are going to fill an important gap in the workforce of the public sector. But whats most important is that they will make the unemployed feel useful and facilitate their re-entry into the ordinary labour market. The unemployment jobs are going to be of benefit to both society and the unemployed.",0
260,4005.a2.txt,Too Big to Be Beautiful - A glance at Swedish pre-schools,"When I was recently working as an unqualified teacher in a Swedish pre-school, I found myself, alone, in charge of a group of 20 children. In the afternoons I was sometimes responsible for a group of 34 five- and six-year olds. Several of the qualified teachers were on sick-leave. They were burnt out. One afternoon, one of the children disappeared. When his mother came to pick him up, I had no idea where to find him. We looked for 30 minutes before he was found. His mother cried. The boy cried. My legs were trembling. At least nobody was hurt this time. I spent other days in the forest with 40 children and two substitutes, who were only there for the day. I made sure I brought a cellphone, in case something would happen. When working as a pre-school teacher, two eyes are not enough.
My experience tells me that the Government has to spend more money on childcare in order to reduce the size of the groups of children and to prevent the burning out of teachers. Groups of 20 children younger than six years old are far too often in the hands of inexperienced and unqualified substitutes. This is shocking and unacceptable. But luckily, it is not unchangeable. 
Ultimately, the responsibility lies with the Government. It is the Government that has been the driving force in the development of a society dependent on a state childcare system. It has been their policy to promote a system where all children receive equal education and care, as a part of the work for a society with equality of opportunity and equality between the sexes. The tax system has, for these reasons, been reformed. Today, taxes are supposed to finance childcare. As a result of this policy, it is impossible for many parents to stay home with their children. Many cannot afford to work part-time. As a result, most children at the ages of 2-6 spend several hours in institutions. Some children are left to the care of the pre-school teacher for over ten hours per day. It is therefore obvious that the childcare system has to keep a certain standard unless working class children and children with a single-parent, will yet again have different opportunities. The standard, however, cannot be maintained without funding. Despite its responsibility, the Government has carried out economic measures, which have had negative effects on the size of the groups and the quality of the childcare. A change of policy is necessary. 
The economic measures taken by the Government have been said to be necessary to keep the budget in balance. This has been the main aim of the central government as well as of local authorities. The budget is usually an economic plan for a short period of time, a couple of years at the very best. The cuts in public spending will, however, have a different effect, in the long run. The impact on society can be disastrous, as the main object of pre-school education is socialisation. Children in pre-school are developing social skills such as empathy. They are supposed to learn to function in a group and understand the rules of human interaction. Small groups and educated teachers are vital to this process of socialisation. Children have to be seen and cared for in order to learn to see others and care about them. It is clear that the present situation in the Swedish childcare system will lead to social maladjustment, such as truancy, violence, criminality and drug-abuse. Society will sooner or later have to pay. 
The pre-school teacher is not only a role model, but also a guide. He or she is essential to help children solve conflicts and help to explain phenomena in everyday life. Children also need help to express thoughts and feelings. They need help to develop their language in order to become full-grown, independent, reflecting human beings. In pre-school this is done best by conversation in small groups. The early years in life are crucial when it comes to giving children a base to stand on for further education. In a society where education is continuously becoming more and more important, it seems peculiar that pre-school education is put at a disadvantage. Today, pre-school teachers are not only responsible for a large group of children, they are also occupied with cleaning, doing dishes, drying clothes etc. The children do not receive a pre-school education of any quality. The do not even get the attention they need. Meanwhile, teachers are becoming burnt out, and always feeling inadequate. This is all due to insufficient funding.
I am therefore sure society would gain from spending more money on pre-school education, from an economical as well as an educational point of view. The most obvious point of view is, of course, the human one. We cannot treat what we value most as cattle. Pre-school education has become a way of storing children. The only way to deal with this and to secure the quality, is by reducing the size of the groups and increasing the number of adults, educated teachers, in pre-school. This responsibility lies with the Government. At present, it cannot even be guaranteed that parents will find their children, safe and sound, where they left them in the morning.",0
261,4006.a2.txt,On the verge of a crisis.,"Is it high time to raise the teachers' salaries? This is a statement that has been discussed in many parts of the country. It is a topic that is frequently debated on the news and in various TV and radio programs. The most frequent arguments for the raising of the salaries are: to improve the teaching profession's standing in society, to motivate the teachers and to increase the percentage of male teachers.
On the other hand, there are counterarguments such as the long holidays, the short workdays and the spending of money on other areas of school than on teachers have been heard.

By raising the teachers' salaries the profession would first of all improve its current standing. To know about your future economical situation is of great importance for young people who have not yet decided their future careers. This knowledge would attract more students to the teacher training and also to actually finish their degree. Many students do not graduate at present, due to lack of belief in their future as a teacher. If we manage to solve the present problem with too few actual teachers in school, this would help us to keep up the standard of Swedish education.
The low wages of Swedish teachers make many of them leave their jobs to be replaced by young substitutes. Many of these do not have a degree and are often not competent enough to teach certain subjects. In the long run this has the effect on the pupils that they are not being taught enough to be able to cope with society, further education and future careers. To motivate the teachers to stay, they must know that they will get credit for all the hard work. Knowing this, they will give us enthusiastic teachers that in turn will generate with the pupils' improved skills and grades. 
Female staff dominates the Swedish school at present. The profession seems to have taken a different turn, being more of a caring kind. Children need caring, but they also need discipline and most of all they need role models for their future life. This is because of their tendency to not do what they are told by adults, but instead imitating them in their behaviour. If the teachers√¢ wages are raised, it will attract more men to school. This is essential since all children need role models, both boys and girls.

When it comes to the counterarguments, there is the myth of too long holidays. Usually people in Sweden have five weeks of vacation per year, while teachers have not only summer holidays of ten weeks but also Christmas, Easter, autumn- and spring-break. Considering the length of their vacations, the teachers should be satisfied with the fairly low wages.
A second argument is that teachers in most cases spend a fairly low number of hours at work. Besides, one could argue that the teachers' profession cannot be that strenuous, considering that they work with children. Compared to other regular workers in society the teachers' wages are not extremely low. 
All the money that would be spent on the teachers could be of better use, for example to buy new and more current books and to improve the environment in the school. 

The Swedish school system has been very well functioning for a long time. To be able to maintain this reputation, something must be done and according to my opinion the first step should be to raise the teachers' salaries: at present they are a joke. The people who argument against this do not realize that we are on the verge of an educational crisis. This is what has happened in the segregated parts of America, children (mostly in the state/public schools) not learning enough to be able to cope with their lives when they get older. The result of this has been not only that many American inhabitants seem to lack general basic knowledge but also in an increased rate of crime and drug-abuse. Hopefully the Swedish educational system will not go as far as the American has, but in order to prevent this to happen, something has to be done now.",0
262,4008.a2.txt,Let homosexuals adopt,"Something many people consider a matter of course is that homosexuals always should be equal to heterosexuals. However, many of them who first agree change their attitude when it comes to adoption. This change seems strange to me and if you read on I will explain why.
Since homosexuality no longer was considered a sickness, the situation for homosexuals has very well improved, and rather quickly (although not as quickly as I would wish). We live in a modern and multicultural society, and we should know better than to be prejudiced when there are much more important things to do. In Sweden, as in many other countries, homosexuals are allowed to register partnership, which should mean that it has finally been accepted that love between homosexuals is worth as much as love between heterosexuals.
The step between understanding that and that homosexuals also would make good parents should not be too far. We can't say that homosexuals and heterosexuals are equal if they are not given the same rights.
Still, opponents often say that children with homosexual adoptive parents will be harassed by other children at school, sometimes making it sound as it would be most strange indeed if they wouldn't be so. I can understand that this is a common first reaction, yet this seems very odd to me as I find it hard to believe that children would condemn something like this without influence from their parents or other adults. Moreover, there already are children who live with a homosexual parent and the parent's partner, and there hasn't been proved that these children have problems caused by that. Besides, I think that as long as adoption isn't legal for homosexuals, children living with a homosexual parent with a partner may get the idea that there actually is something wrong with their situation, and I don't think that is what we want.
Many people usually consider the main problem to be that all children need both their mother and their father both for love and to identify themselves with. Only, we know that there are many children who live with only one parent and not everyone identifies themselves with their parents or with their parents only. There may be a relative or a teacher the children look up to. I would say that what children need isn't necessarily one mother and one father, but they need love, care and security, and where they are given that, there is a good home.
I don't think the question is if there ever will be a law that gives homosexuals the same right to adopt as heterosexuals, because there probably will. In Sweden, only two political parties have voted against the proposal, the Christian democrats and the conservatives. The question is when.
Altogether, I think that until adoption is legal for homosexuals, people's attitude will not change. The sooner it becomes a law, the easier it will be for people to accept the whole concept. I must say I really am sure that children with homosexual adoptive parents will not have problems simply because of that unless other people think they should have. The problems only exist as long as people let them. Hence people must try to get rid of their prejudice and not concentrate on unnecessary problems. We should show that homosexuals and heterosexuals are equal!",0
263,4009.a2.txt,Can we not have the opportunity to choose?,"How would you feel if you had the marvellous opportunity to be home with your child for at a couple of years, and got money from the state. I would really love that idea. I think that if you can take care of your child at home and give them a solid ground from the beginning of the child's life they are going to be more secure individuals. The government always have said that we as parents are responsible for our children and on the other hand they have made rules that says otherwise. I want the rules to be changed.

My strong opinion is that I want the parents to be home with their child/children for the first years of their lives. I think that the children are going to be more secure in their rolls and in their own persons if they can grow up in a secure environment as the home should be. In the first three years the foundation of a child's character is laid. Therefore it is of great concern for the children that I want this to happen. If you look into the schools in Sweden today you see a lot of anger and a lot of insecurity and if you then look at where they come from the most of the children have been to day-care from a very early age. I do not say that there is something wrong with day-care, it is just that the most of the children would have needed their parents more. The parents of today are so stressed today that they do not have enough time for their children. The children as an effect of that have also been more stressed and that is not good for the future. I would like to change this. If you can get money from the state to take care of your own child or children, you do not have to feel inadequate and you know that you can afford to be home. We have to give the parents the opportunity that they need to take care of their own children. The most parents would like to have this opportunity if you ask them, but the Government is not helping us out with this. Instead they are making rules that make the parents leave their children at day-care more and more.

The Government, the Social Democrats have made a rule that it is going to make day-care less expensive for parents. That is really a plan that they have wanted for a long time. It says in the curriculum of 1994 that the school is going to foster the children, not to bring them up that is the parents responsibility to, give them a solid ground. Therefore I wonder, how can we do that if we are working all the time? The Social Democrats have always wanted us to work, I think that is because they want to bring up our children to be like they want them to be, to have the control. Why do they not give us the choice to decide for ourselves if we want day-care or not. It cost the Swedish people a lot of money with day-care. A couple of years ago one child cost 100.000 Swedish crowns a year (I think it is much more expensive now) for the community. Let us say if you gave the same amount of money or 90000 Swedish crowns a year to the parents that want to be home with their child/children, at the same time the state have made a profit by saving money. This way, parents at least have a choice. 

Of course everyone wonders is there not any backsides to this. I know that a lot of people can say that the children can be isolated and cannot have normal relations toward other children. I can agree that there can be a few of them that can be that but most of them I think not. The day-care centres have appointed times when parents with their children can come and play with the others and the parents can meet and talk. Then you can prevent that your child is being isolated. If you say that there can be parents that want to be home instead of working, maybe there is some but most of the parents think of what is best for their own child. 

As you can see I am very positive toward this idea and I think that you and me as a parent and your child/children can get to know one another better this way. It will give the children a solid ground and security in themselves and in their homes. I will assure you that this is a very god way of letting the children grow up in a calm environment, the effect will be calmer children. Why do we not have a choice then? The only thing we can choose now is day-care, I do not think that is a choice. Think of all the good things that would come out of this, if we had the opportunity to choose.",0
264,4010.a2.txt,Old fashioned or the hottest trend?,"What was in the past something so natural for young people as wearing jeans is nowadays, wearing school uniforms is today often looked upon as something boring, old fashioned and something that deprives a child much of his or her identity. I disagree and think that school uniforms could serve as an effective weapon against problems related to increasingly differences in children's culture, background and social status. I think that there are so many good arguments for making school uniforms compulsory and I'm surprised that so few schools in Sweden today consider wearing school uniforms as an important step towards less bullying and more equality.
I can't count the mornings during my years in school that I was standing in front of my wardrobe searching for something nice to wear. And none of these days were any special, except for when photographs were taken. All the other days were just ordinary school days. And who doesn't remember worrying about not wearing the same type of clothes as everybody else, about being too different from all the others. This is, I think, something that lots of children carry with them from their first year in school till they graduate. And that is something we have to change.
More and more Swedish schools today experience increasingly bullying often when cultural diversity grows. There is obviously a need among children of being a group, not just mentally but even more important, in appearance. And what would suit better, in a world where fashion is as important as it is in society today and when the fashion trade direct more and more advertisement towards younger and younger people, than start wearing uniforms in school. I think this would make fashion more of a personal interest, something you as an individual could choose if you want to support or not and that would change the situation in school. 
Because someone wearing old clothes, bought five years ago and that two or three older brothers or sisters have already worn for a couple of years, is often an easy victim for bullies. And a child being bullied for a thing like this is something that we should really make an effort to stop. And why not doing it in such a simple way as to introduce school uniforms. We live in a multi- cultural society where conflicts not seldom arise because of differences in manners and customs and but it's still our will to create an harmonious unity for children in schools and during their social activities. We want all to have the possibility of keeping their own traditions and culture but there is also a fight for equality, for all being the same and for all having the same possibilities. School uniforms would much correspond to these aims and would make it easier, especially for the most vulnerable in society.
Unfortunately, there are still huge differences in economic status among Swedish families and this is of course followed by big differences for children in the same class. A single child with well- paid parents has no problems in always following the hottest trend and always having the right newest clothes and things. The situation for another child in the same class with three brothers and sisters and with parents earning just under the average income is of course totally different. This, the economic aspect, is another important one of introducing school uniforms. Not only would children be in need of fewer sets of clothes since there would be no difference in appearance (with ordinary clothes, both children and parents feel that the child can't wear the same clothes all the time), but it would also make it easier for a child to wear old clothes that doesn't fit an older brother or sister anymore since the style hasn't changed. 
  People against school uniforms say that the uniforms make children lose their identity and that introducing school uniforms would be a bad way of trying to control things. But young children's identities are reflected much more in their behaviour and in what they say. Contrary to make less identity, I think that children would feel it assuring, knowing that they've all got the same clothes not depending on if they are rich or poor, black or white or if they come from two totally different countries and cultures.",0
265,4011.a2.txt,"There is more to your eighteenth birthday than your being allowed in to the local pub. You are now seen as an adult. This means you must start paying taxes, you are responsible for your own finances and debts, you can get married and take a bank loan to buy yourself a house or flat, you can drive a car or even a truck. You are now old enough to face criminal charges as an adult, which means you can be sent to prison. You are expected to do your military service and fight for your country in times of war. You can get a hunting certificate which entitles you to own a rifle. However, you are still not allowed to buy yourself, say, a bottle of wine to go with your meal. In my opinion a person entitled to all these things must also be able to take responsibility when it comes to buying alcohol, after all, it takes a lot more responsibility to deal with buying a house than with buying a bottle of wine.","Today, in Sweden, the law allows people of eighteen to buy alcoholic beverages in restaurants, pubs, clubs and caf√©s, but not to buy them from state liquor shops (System Bolaget). In addition, you are officially not allowed to bring in alcoholic drinks from other countries, including other countries in the EU, where these are normally available for all people over the age of eighteen. I find this situation ridiculous and believe that the law should be changed. 
My main and most obvious point of argumentation is to do with the hypocrisy surrounding Swedish laws regarding alcohol. While you are allowed to drink alcohol in, for example, pubs and restaurants at the age of eighteen you are still not deemed old enough to buy your own alcoholic drink from a shop. If the law allows you to buy liquor in one place it is inconsistent not to allow you to do so in another. As there is no law preventing eighteen-year-olds from actually drinking these beverages, there should be no other restrictions concerning alcohol. 
The fact that you are not allowed to buy this bottle of wine yourself by no means stops you from getting hold of it in other ways. Although it is illegal to buy alcohol for teenagers there is no shortage of people offering to do so. This whole business is turning people into criminals. Most parents have at some point offered their son or daughter a glass of wine with their meal. Take graduation, for example, a typical situation when drinking Champagne is very much part of a tradition. A tradition which, according to Swedish laws, could count as a criminal offence. 
Another more serious point is the fact that a lot of young people are so set on getting hold of alcohol that they will drink almost anything they can get their hands on, including home-brewed liquor, also known as moonshine. As well as increasing this market the law is encouraging people to bring in more liquor from neighbouring countries, like from Denmark, where it is a lot easier to get hold of. Allowing eighteen-year-olds to buy legally prepared spirits from a liquor store would to some extent decrease these trends.
All in all I feel that this law is a bit silly. Prohibiting people under the age of twenty from buying alcoholic drinks from shops, but not from restaurants or pubs is definitely showing double standards. If being eighteen means that you are an adult and thus old enough to be held responsible for all your deeds, as is in fact expected of an adult, I believe that this responsibility should include the right to buy a bottle of wine, in a shop, for home use. In my opinion a change in law might, as well as making the laws consistent, give people a healthier point of view concerning alcohol, thus, hopefully, decreasing the demand for home-brewed liquor.",0
266,4012.a2.txt,The Society Gives Possibilities to Elderly People.,"To be old and need special help is a common problem. Many consider that it's the relatives' responsibility to take care of the elderly, but the elderly have the right to experience a meaningful life of their own. Quality of life is to be with friends, take part in activities and have possibilities to improve the physical condition. In comparison with a living by the family the elderly will get all this and also be carefully looked after by educated staff.
Elderly people living in a block of service flats supplied by the local society have much more possibilities to develop than those who live at their family's house do. In the service flats they have always staff around who can help, encourage and stimulate them. Further they have a nurse and a doctor at hand and special aid for rehabilitation. If something would happen when they are alone, perhaps they have fallen or need help for the lavatory they just use the alarm system. To feel safe and secure is important for them when they have to trust other people for living. Other advantages in this kind of living are the possibility to take part in a lot of different activities. It can be a therapist who is reading aloud from newspapers or books or a local musician who entertain them. There are also several physical activities like the possibility to weave, to use the joiner's workshop, to take part in gymnastics or to do some assistance in the institutional kitchen. In a private home without all these kinds of resources it can be difficult to revitalize them and instead they will be sitting in an armchair or a rocking chair all the day long, perhaps they don't even eat. 
Even though the heavy expenses for care of old people are a big part in the budget of the Society nowadays, is it cheaper to let up buildings and staff for this kind of living than put all the responsibility on the family or other relatives. To take care of people who are too old to look after themselves and need special help cost a lot of energy and time. Thus it influence the family's own working hours, leisure and health. The result can be less employed people who are paying taxes and more people being on the sick list because of overwork. Besides families with less salary can be forced to apply for social allowance, which means that the Society have to pay in any case and the final costs might be even bigger. 
The benefits for families with relatives looked after by the state, are to begin with, their opportunities to plan their relations with the elderly. They will be allowed to do what they want without having a bad conscience all the time. Instead they can do visits when it's convenient and spend pleasant time together. Furthermore, it's liberating for them to get away from asking other people of assistance now and then when problem comes up and they need help to look after the elderly. It's trying to be bound night and day without getting a chance to relax. Finally it gives the family time to establish a social life together with friends, which is one of the necessities to reach quality of life.
One disadvantage with elderly people living in a social institution is that a generation gap will arise. Young people will not be accustomed with old people and perhaps distance themselves from natural contacts. In fact there are children who have never met an old person living in such an institution. Another disadvantage can be the risk for the elderly to be institutionalized, for example to be depending on the daily run of things and refuse to do something else like a walk or a trip, because of the fear to miss the dinner or something like that. 
Despite of disadvantages this kind of living is mostly the best for the elderly. In most of the institutions nowadays the lodgers use their own furniture because it is important for them to have well-known things around like the favourite chair or a home-made rug besides all photographs of children and grandchildren. It's also important for them to keep their integrity, to have a life of their own without ending up in the position as a child to their own child. To be a lifelong parent is a right.",0
267,4013.a2.txt,THE RIGHT SIDE THERE SHOULD BE MORE EMPHASIS ON ARTISTIC SUBJECTS AT SCHOOL,"Most mental and physical abilities change and develop as people grow. It is a salient feature in our schoolsystem that a great deal is done to cultivate skills such as reading, writing and arithmetics. However, the development of artistic skills seems to come to a stop at quite an early age. Many grown-ups stay at a 14-year-old-level when it comes to expressing themselves artistically. One of the reasons why schools favour the more theoretical subjects is that it is a prevalent notion that what you learn in arts classes is of little use in daily life, which is not true!
Firstly, in art classes we deal with the fact that we live in a world where we are drowned with impressions and images such as advertisements, commercials, musicvideos and news-images from various media. Commercials are often flashy, entertaining and inventive. But their purpose is to make us buy things and they do not reflect the society we live in today. Not even the daily news gives us a correct image of the world. People with values, ideas and prejudice choose events and make us think that these are the major happenings in the world, when in fact these images are interpretations of what the world looks like at a certain moment. Often newsflashes come out as objective and true, so it is vital to be critical and to understand images and their connotations and not just perceive them as the ""truth"".
Moreover, according to experts' research the brain is divided into two parts - the left and the right. Reading, writing and arithmetics are skills that are usually located in the left hemisphere of the brain. This part is also considered as dominant and even tends to take over tasks which are more suitable for the right side of the brain to handle. The right hemisphere is generally seen as the subordinate one. It is alotted artistic abilities, thus good at things like music, drawing, creativity and perception. All these knacks seem somewhat forgotten in our schools, and although they are valued they are considered to be a natural result from using ones verbal and analytical skills. However, I will argue that this is not the case and that we need specifically to cultivate the right side of our brain, something that is hardly possible to do during one sixty-minute-lesson of art once a week.
People in general are of the opinion that the ability to draw or perform other artistic activities is something that a minority of people are gifted with and if you can't already draw there is no use in trying to learn. It is like deciding not to learn a foreign language because you can't already speak it. Actually, the difficulty to draw lies rather in learning how to observe or being able to switch over to a particular way of seeing. From the time we grow up we are used to seeing things through words; a cat, an apple, a tree and so on. Consequently, the left side of the brain is activated and tends to put things into categories and to symbolise things. We all have a symbol for a face, an eye or a house, but this is not what they really look like. To draw is a process which demands careful observation and meticulous perception of details and all kinds of information. This can be trained in a number of ways and the trick is to give the brain a task which the left hemisphere either doesn't know how to perform or doesn't want to perform. This demands a lot of concentration. For example, you can study an up-side-down-image without having seen it the correct way first and try and draw what you see. When you focus on how the lines meet instead of what the image actually represents the left side becomes confused and since it can't compare the information to any stored memories it leaves the task to the more suitable right side. The majority of people are not aware of the fact that we actually neglect one side of the brain and its' capacity. Thus, the school has a huge responsibility in conveying the importance of exploring our whole brain, not just a part of it.
What is more, the left and the right side of the brain actually cooperate in several areas. Psychologists, for example, use drawing as a method to release and understand hidden emotions. A drawing from the heart can be of immense help when solving an emotional problem and revealing what you actually feel. When the right side of the brain has shown the left side what the problem is the left side can solve the problem through language and logical thinking.
In conclusion, to fully function as human beings there is a need for the revaluation of artistic skills and perception. Today the schoolsystem rewards the skills of the left side of the brain to such an extent that much of our childrens' inherent opportunities of the right side will stay undeveloped.",0
268,4014.a2.txt,"Unemployd, new assisstants at schools?","Why should people who receive unemployment benefits be required to work in the public sector? There are three main reasons were I will argue for such a move. Firstly in the Swedish newspapers we can read almost everyday that schoolteachers, nurses, policedepartments and homes for elderly people are constatly struggling because of reductions of the employees but I will focus on the school. Secondly if the unemployed was involved in different public sectors it would not only benefit the public sector but also to help the unempolyed not to loose their selfesteem and the feeling of being needed and thirdly, the state will also benefit from this suggestion.
Over the years the Swedish government has cut down on the staff at many public sectors, for example in schools and it doesn't make sence as we have high number of children who are attending the shcool for the moment (high birthrates at the end of 1980 and beginning 1990). The unemployed could be of extra assitance to the teachers, patrolling in the corridors and at the playgrounds and see to that no unauthorized is staying at the schools. More adults in the school enviroment are requested by many principals especially after the tragic incident that recently took place at a school in Stockholm where a boy got killed by another boy who did not belong to the school. We do need more adults to prevent these kinds of actions however this incident was extreme but there are harassments and vandalization everyday at schools all over the country. 
Another aspect is that many children of today need more attention from adulst than before as there are many variations of constilations of families, high number of children doesn't live with both of theire parents, they have ""new"" fathers or mothers,of course some of these constilations are good but others aren't. Moreover it's not only in schools that extra help is required but also at daycare-centers and in after-school recreation centers. 
For instance, a large number of unemployd are to be found among the immigrants and it's also a problem with the segregation. If we involve them in different projects, they will learn the language easier and they will also be a part of the Swedish sociaty much more than they are today. To catch the immigrants attention they could attend to a shorter or a longer education, depending on how well educated they are from the beginning.
Another point is also that in the future at a downward ecnonomic trend we might have a new category of unemployed and the jobs must be made as attractive as possible. The public sector could be more forsighted to help people when they are forced into unemployment and propose other opportunities. I will quote from Text-Tv, 10th February. ""Employees at the post-offices will be educated for the schoolsystem. Redundant personal at post-offices might solve the shortage of the staff at schools. There are plans for a new education for assistants of educationalist which are for the staff who will run the risk of loosing their jobs as the Post-Office will cut down on personal according to Norrk√∂pings tidningen. The Shool of Education in Stockholm and Posten Futurum are both behind this new education which may already start spring -01. The assistants will work together with both teachers and pupils and for other reasons that takes their time of teaching"" end quotation. Another aspect is that in a few years there will be a huge retirement among teachers and also that educated young teachers are leaving the profession because of the situation at schools today.
As a result the state will also benefit by a such proposal as the unemployed will be involved in the society and it might open up the opportunities for them to be interessted in different kinds of professions. Moreover the children will have a more secure environment in the schools and hopefully accomplish more than earlier. In areas where schools have big problems there could be more of the unempolyed assistants furthermore the teaching as a profession will be more attractive.
To sum up, rather than only paying unemploment benefits the unemployed should be asked to contribute in neglected areas like for instance, school, hospital-care and care for elderly people. Hopefully the result will increase the quality of life for all involved.",0
269,4015.a2.txt,NO SMOKING,"Let's say there are eight tables in a coffee shop. Half of them have the sign No Smoking. It is one local - smoke does extend. Let's say you are out dancing. Hopefully no drunk waves his or her cigarette in your hair. Even though YOU didn't smoke, you feel like an ashtray the day afterwards and your clothes have to hang in the fresh air for days before you can wear them again. Or maybe you couldn't go out dancing at all, because you have asthma? Let's say we go to a restaurant instead, to enjoy a nice meal in a nice atmosphere? NO - one has to breathe the smoke of the table-neighbor's Marlboro. Smokers are a minority of the people! Why should they rule over a majority? It is time for change. It is time to forbid smoking in all caf√©s, discos and restaurants. 
A few public locals have a non-smoking-rule inside their walls. But they are not many. Without a general rule or law, the bigwigs in the cigarette-companies and the smokers themselves are not the only non-smoking-opponents, but several of the restaurants- coffee shops- and pub-owners as well. The latter group of people is afraid of losing customers if they took the step to forbid the smoking. Once again - smokers are a minority and a law against smoking would give the same smoke-free environment in all public places. The owners would also feel better, knowing that their workers - the waitresses and the bartenders - finally got a human working-place, a working-place which won't give them black lunges. And I don't have to tell you that the waitresses and bartenders would feel better! Research also shows that a majority of the people prefers going out in a non-smoking local. There are people staying at home because of smoking being permitted in restaurants, caf√©s and bars. People with allergies, asthma. Parents who don't want to put their children' (or their own) health in danger. That this law should mean that the owners would lose customers and therefor money, can't be counted as a counter-argument since that statement is not true. 
But maybe the cigarette-companies would lose some money since this non-smoking law means that we would get less party-smokers, less people smoking because ""everyone else does"". The cigarette-companies are enemies. They are the ones earning money on fooling us (so if they would lose some money...it's just yet another argument for this law). The smokers are the ones being fooled, the ones who pay - for their own bad health and for the non-smokers' as well. But with this law we would not only get less passive-smokers, but also less ""real-smokers"". Many of today's party-smokers, first-triers and group-pressure-smokers start to smoke heavily also outside the party, outside the gang. This law could save these people.
Non-smoking air and less smokers in total means that we would get better general health and we would have fewer people dying in lung-cancer. The hospital would save money as well as the individual (money not spent on cigarettes - it's a fortune you can spend on something else!). 
Smokers know what danger they put theirs own lives in - and others. I don't think that their choice - their dangerous smoke - should be forced on someone else than themselves. I realize that the smokers might feel run over when their territory is being restricted and they will never agree on a law without any room for them. Therefor I want this law to state: ""All public locals, such as coffee-shops, pubs, discos, restaurants etc. should have a non-smoking-policy. The owner is responsible of giving the customers and his employees a non-smoking milieu. And then: ""The owner has a choice whether he/she wants to find a solution for the smokers or not. That could be a closed smoking-room or a smoking-square outside the building. The important issue is that no smoke is allowed in the main-locals"". It is as simple as that!",0
270,4016.a2.txt,"My life, my choice","It is forbidden in Swedish law for doctors as well as other people to end a patient's life by purpose. What the patient feels is apparently not important. If someone helps a patient to die he is guilty of manslaughter. It makes no difference if the patient is suffering and wants to die. There is no such thing as ""mercy killing"" in Swedish law.
In this case even pets get better and a more human treatment. If your pet picks up a disease that is impossible or still difficult to cure, you bring him to the vet to give him a shot so the pet falls asleep. It makes me start thinking, why cannot we have the possibility to decide what to do with our own lives.
Many people are lying motionless in beds in our hospitals every day, where they are kept alive by machines. Don't you think it is right that a person in that situation, a person who only is waiting to die, should have the opportunity to ask his doctor for a lethal injection? I think the answer is obvious. Who would like to lay there just waiting? If I see myself in this position, I would not be able to think about anything else then the fact that death actually came closer every day. There would be too many things reminding me all the time, when the relatives come to visit with tears in their eyes looking extremely sad.
I reckon that a human being who does not feel as if he has no purpose left in life and does not have any dignity left would be able to take his life, with some help by the doctor. Note that no one but the patient should be able to decide such a ting. No relative or close friend shall make the decision. 
In our society suicide is not accepted, it is immoral. That is one of the reasons that some people are against euthanasia, but I do not think one can compare euthanasia and suicide in a fair way, it is two separate things. I see it as a natural thing to help shortening a painful life in bed. 
Religious people are often against euthanasia. They claim that life is something God gave us and he is the one who is going to take it back when it is time. But in my opinion that does not make sense. I mean, if God decides when to end my life he has not really given it to me, just lent it. If I receive a gift from someone, I decide what to do with it and if I borrow something from someone may I not say thank you and return it whenever I want to?
The persons who are in the situation where euthanasia is needed are often not able to commit suicide on their own. (In practical terms) By this I do not mean that only those persons should have the rights to do this. Everyone who has some kind of incurable disease where the treatment is incredible painful should have the right to decide what to do with his life. Cancer, AIDS or any other lethal disease, it makes no difference. 
Because of the prohibition of euthanasia, the patients still get drugged but not by the purpose to help them die, even though the doctors are aware that it could lead to that. All that sneaking to avoid the rules could be stopped if we changed the law and active euthanasia possible to choose. Make the active euthanasia legal to make the dying people less suffering!",0
271,4017.a2.txt,Myth or Reality?,"Silver treasures from the Viking Age (approx. 800 - 1050 A.D.) have always been an appreciated topic in discussions - both academical and general. The great interest stems from the large quantity of hoards (there are for example around 700 silver hoards found only on the island Gotland), and the abundant mythical sphere which sorrounds them. What we really know about these hoards is that they once were laid to rest in our native soil to dwell on their secrets, not willing nor able to share them with the posterity. 
The mysterious hoards have especially since the 1950s stimulated many a scientist into the battle of more academical studies of the Viking Age and its silver. A debate was thereby started, and is still going strong. Rather a few theories have over the years risen from the ongoing debate, some, I have to say, more roted in reality than others. The most recent - and also most successful - hypothesis claims that the hoards were hidden in contemporary houses, strictly as security rutin, that is, to hide the jewellery from potential thieves. (A bank-box synonym) I strongly disagree with this thesis' aim, which is to generalize the reasons behind silver deposits into one simple explanation. I think that the situation is more complex, and that there also is a possibility of a religious background to the silver hoards.
First of all, nothing contradicts the idea that it could have been religious reasons behind the treasure deposits made by the 11th century inhabitants. On the other hand, the establishing of facts concerning silver hoards is indeed a delicate and problematic matter altogether, due to the reality that the only things we are able to state about them are the location where we find them and the material vision of them at that point. In other words, the rest is really just a net of high qualified guessings. 
What really favours my idea of religious reasons, is a well-known phenomenon in the archaeological dicipline called Odin's law. This expression was first mentioned in an old Scandinavian saga, written in the 13th century. Odin's law means that a person buries silver in honour of the gods (Odin etc), but the finesse with this deed is that he/she will get back the silver in the next life, and is thereby assured of affluency in a future life as well. A god place for a sacrifice of this sort would probably not be in your house, but perhaps in the forest under a bush or stone.
Further, silver has alway been thought of as having magical power. Many myths and legends have as a result of this come to surround the silver tresures, proclaiming them to be the source of many strange events, even after the Viking Age. Silver was also said to be capable of protecting and effecting your life and destiny in different kind of ways. The very same thing was ascribed to dead ancestors. Their graves were therefore placed close to their progeny's settings, clearly recognizable in the landscape as small mounds or monuments. Imagine then if you buried silver in a forefather's grave, that would give you dubbel protection (against demons and generally nasty people)! Silver items have been found in earlier graves, which eliminates the possibility of them being grave gifts.
Obviously, old sagas don't prove a thing, exept perhaps that people in past times were able to make up exciting stories based on vivid imagination. This may be true, but I would here like to apply the proverb; no smoke without fire. The trubble is that we can not figure out exactly what our ancestors' religion included or how it was carried out. Beliefs about magic posessed by silver could very well have been an important factor in their supposed metaphysical world, and that the rich silver hoards we find today actually is the vestiges of their religious exercises. 
Critics might say: why base an argumentative essay on nothing more established than a mere guess (or a hunch in my case)? Personally, I think it is more than a guess. The fact that we have found silver hoards in environments other than in contemporary houses, speaks for itself. Hiding silver for thieves must be, I agree, most convenient in your house, not in the woods where the groth is nothing but stabil, and can after a while effectively prevent you from ever finding your silver again by changing appearance. The question which follows so naturally runs; how will you then explain the hoards found in the forests, nowhere near a house, especially not one from the 10th and 11th centuries? Lingering manifestations from a religion dead long ago, I say.
Conclusively I would like to say that there is certainly not one single explanation one can apply on every silver hoard. Each one has its own, individual story, but I find it very likely that many of them were put away from the eye of time with religious overtones.",0
272,4018.a2.txt,Legalize Abortion In The Whole World!,"I think there should be a law in every country that says it's legal to have an abortion. However, I can understand the strongest argument of those who want it to be illegal; that it's a life we kill. I also think a bit in those lines because it's hard to tell when life begins and when the soul begins to exist. However, I don't want to put these thoughts into a law, because we can't have a law that decides what a woman should do with her own body, to force her to give birth to a baby. In that case we could also legislate about other things that concern choices that a woman or a man should make of their body. Therefore I found that the arguments for abortion have much more relevance than those against.
First of all I think that a woman must have the right to decide about what to do with her own body. She's the one who will have to carry the baby around in her stomach and then go through the delivery.
I also think that if a woman gets pregnant through a rape, abortion should be justified, because it might not be easy for either the mother or the child to live with the fact that this child is a result of a rape. It is quite possible that the mother in such a situation could begin to hate the child and have problems with how to treat it. That would lead to devastating consequences for the child.
Another matter in this question about abortion is that in many countries where it's illegal to have an abortion, many women go to a less qualified person who does the operation in their home. That is very risky and may cause life-threatening infections. Therefore I think it is better to legalise abortion so that it occurs under medical security, because I think that women will always go to those who does criminal abortions, though they know it's dangerous, as long as there's no law that justifies abortion.
Avery common problem all over the world is that very young girls get pregnant to early in their lives. Maybe at the time they study to get an education so they can get a job in the future. In that time of their life, to have a baby might destroy their future plans. A young girl is very often not ready to and doesn't have the ability to be a mother and take care of a baby. She is a child herself. The boyfriend or just the boy in question is mostly as unprepared as the girl is and one can't demand that they be parents at such a young age. Then maybe all three lives will be destroyed, or if it's a girl alone with a baby, two lives might be destroyed. In a situation like this I think it's better to save one or two lives, by having an abortion, than destroy two or three, by giving birth to the baby.
I also think that a legalization of abortion will help prevent poverty in the world. In countries where many people are poor, and abortion is illegal, there are often several children in one family and their parents can hardly afford to feed them. The children become underfed. Many of those children may not even have been planned. If abortion were legal in those countries, poverty could be reduced and fewer people would have a difficult life.
However, abortion is a very serious matter and I think that it should be discussed consistently what an abortion might cause. It is hard to tell how a person will react and how a person will be able to deal with such a thing. Therefor I think there should be both a doctor and a psychologist who sit down with the woman or the couple and explain the risks an abortion might entail, both physical and mental.
So, abortion should be legalized in the whole world for a number of reasons. First of all because the woman should have the right to decide over her own body and especially if she is a victim of a rape. Then also because I think that legalization would help prevent criminal, dangerous abortions, prevent that young girls' future be destroyed and to some extent reduce poverty in the world.",0
273,4019.a2.txt,Earning by working,"This is a very difficult question but I shall try to explain why it's so important why unemployed people should have to work for their checks. I shall prove that all arguments against such a proposition is not large enough to affect the pro sides.
The main reason for having people work for their unemployment money is that you should earn what you get. You should not be able to get money for doing nothing, if you are healthy and able to work. This will make people try even harder to get a ""real"" job before they seek money for unemployment. They might take a job that they would not have taken if they got money for being home. Also if people have to work for the money it is not welfare and they can be proud over it, because they have earned it.
Another factor is that if they have a work, they can not take illegal job at the same time as getting money for being unemployed, and in that way getting double money without having earned it. Today it is possible to get money and at the same time working illegally. This money they receive could be used in other ways were they are more needed.
By working like this you also get experience and that gives you a better chance of getting a real job, than by just sitting home and doing nothing. This gives a much better impression of you when you seek a regular job. This is also a great chance to get into the working life again if you have been ill or unemployed for a long period of time. And you get ""updated"", maybe some things have changed since your last employment. Immigrants recently arrived to Sweden also gets a opportunity to learn Swedish faster and also see how the working climate of Sweden is. This will get them into the Swedish society much faster than today. This gives them a chance to get their new life started and become a part of society. The greatest problem for unemployed people is that they easily get depressed because you identify yourself with your job and you also meet less people when you don't have a job. They easily feel that they are worthless and doesn't contribute to anything. By having them work they get a routine of the day, meet a lot of people and do something meaningful.
The last argument for getting people to work for their unemployment check is that the public sector can get people to do jobs that before where voluntary. That could be jobs such as helping elderly people to get out and socialise, working in hospitals to cheer people up, maintaining flowers and bushes in public parks. Jobs that makes a difference in the peoples life that you get involved with.
Today those jobs are voluntary but I feel that they could be done much better if people have them as full-time jobs with a paycheque. These are very important jobs that the people which perform them is given a large responsibility and this is very important especially if you have recently lost your job and your confidence is not what it used to be. So it is not only good for the public sector it also develops people and make them into better human beings.
All these arguments states that working for your money is the only way to go, considering all the positive affects that this leads to. As every problem, there is also downsides to these arguments, but they are not big enough to affect the positive sides. This will prevent people from receiving money just by staying home and not trying to get a job because this is more comfortable. These jobs will develop people and make them grow as human beings. Having people work for unemployment money, means that they can raise the amount of money you get, and this leads to that you can get a better materialistic quality in your life as well. Today the checks are not very large and having to worry about money also results in depressions and low self-esteem. My opinion is that we shall introduce this as soon as possible and make our society a better place to live in.",0
274,4020.a2.txt,"For what is it exactly about the royal family that we are supposed to respect? How have they contributed to improving the human condition? Is it their durability? Namely, that they are capable of sitting on the throne for years without once going to the toilet during a public engagement? No seriously, something is rotten in the state of Sweden when we are expected to bow to them, and address them by titles, simply because they were born with the name of Bernadotte.","Sweden is according to our schoolbooks a democracy, in which the sovereignty of the people is represented by the parliament (riksdagen). Furthermore Sweden is a constitutional monarchy. King Carl XVI Gustaf is since 1973 officially the chief of state with one sole obligation: to function as a representative on the behalf of Sweden. But why cannot the person promoting Sweden be democratically elected? Would it not be preferable if he or she was appointed due to merits rather than having been in-the-right-womb-at-the-right-time as their only qualification?
Some might say that it is of no significance whether the king is undemocratically appointed since he lacks any real power. This view on democracy is truly shocking, and is as awkward as it is faulty. The Royal family DOES have certain hereditary powers. People tend for example to listen very carefully when Queen Silvia makes a statement, which regretfully has become rather commonplace. For instance, she helped making Sweden's already tense relations with the United States even more agitated by condemning the country's unwillingness to sign a certain bill at a conference held by the United Nations in the year of 2000. It simply does not make sense that a person, just because she carries a certain surname, sees as her duty to intervene in other countries' interstate business. 
Those of us excluded from the ruling elite are expected to know our place, to respect our ""betters"", even if their only qualification for power is to have been born within a certain family. This is the very point I'm aiming at, namely how something that is the leftover rubbish of the Middle Ages can be accepted by a majority of the Swedes. The defenders of the status quo insist that we should support the monarchy as the embodiment of Sweden's great traditions. We should put the kings head on coins and stamps simply because the monarchy stands for historical continuity. In the age of globalization this seems highly reactionary. It does also seem paradoxical that a country, which has been governed by social democrats, almost without interruption, through a century, is so fond of monarchy.
One more reason to abolish the monarchy is that it is expensive. The 40 million SEK a year it costs to maintain a monarchy could certainly be used in better ways. However, it would be wrong to confine criticism of the royals to economic matters. Such a discussion misses the point about the political role that the royal family still plays in Sweden. And it is that role which provides the best reasons for abolishing the monarchy altogether. Anybody who believes in basic democracy should be in favor of abolishing the monarchy, along with all of its hereditary privileges and powers. 
Having said this, it is of course also important to keep the question of royalty in perspective. The monarchy is symbolic of much that is wrong with Swedish society, but it is not the cause of the problems. But calling for the abolition of the monarchy could also help to sweep away some of the double standard circulating in Sweden. There are a lot of people who say they sympathize with the social democratic ideology. They are in favor of a classless society and are pro democracy, but at the same time wishes to maintain the greatest reminder of Sweden as an at one point truly undemocratic country: the monarchy. There is no place for a monarch in a democratic and modern country like Sweden - set Victoria free!",0
275,4021.a2.txt,A world without television,"Could you manage without your TV? Would your life be over if you had to get rid of it? You may feel that way, but, as I see it, it is not so. I want to, through my arguments and through this essay, show you that it is possible and even good to live without a TV. However, nowadays it is hard to find a home without a TV and it seems to be one important part of a good standard of living. For many people, watching TV is a natural daily thing as well as working, going to school, spending time with family and friends. Being aware of all this, I still maintain that it is possible to live your life without a TV, I do nowadays. I think it is even good for you and you will benefit from it. Let me tell you why through my three arguments and my conclusion.
My first argument is about economy. The possession of a TV will increase your costs. First of all you need to have a television set. A new one costs several thousand Swedish crowns. Furthermore you have to pay about 400 Swedish Crowns each quarter of a year, just for the possession of it. Other expenses that might occur are for example: if the TV gets out of order it needs to be repaired. If you then do not have a warrant, the repair will probably cost you a lot of money.
A TV costs you money, but that is not all. My second argument is that I think it can take more things away from you, like your imagination and your creativity. Let me explain this further. When you watch TV you are stuffed with a large number of images, fast clips and a lot of information, not always good information. It is like you do not have to think of your own. Everything is given to you. I think this is bad, especially for young children that watch TV too much. As a consequence of this, it is not strange that they might find school and reading boring because life outside the TV-screen can not be as intensive as the fast clips on MTV or on another channel. Moreover, by the fact that TV does not trigger their imagination or encourage them to think for themselves, I feel that they are not given the possibility to fully develop their own thinking in order to become strong individuals. As I just explained, I am of the opinion that TV can kill your imagination, in addition, watching TV can also be a time-killing occupation, which leads to my next argument.
My third and final argument is that the TV does take valuable time away from you, that you instead could spend on something else or with someone else. In today's society, we all complain about that there is never enough time. We rush to work and to school, we rush home, we have to cook, clean, wash, do this and that. Still we can spend hours in front of the TV. Maybe some of you may say that it is a way to relax, to forget all the 'musts' of our lives. I understand that, but I think that there are other ways of relaxing, like for example taking a walk, alone or with someone, reading a book or just spending time with the ones you love. Look at Sweden today, so many relationships do not last because we do not take the time to cherish them. I do not say TV is all to blame for this, but I do say that the time we spend on watching TV we could spend as quality time with our family or with our friends. It is a good start for making the world a better place.
Now you have read my three arguments concerning life with or without a TV. I have claimed that the TV does take money, imagination and time away from us. If you turn this around: a life without a TV, compared to other people, will give you money to spend on something else, hopefully restore your imagination and creativity to make life more fun and last, but not least, it will give you time that you can give yourself and other people.",0
276,4022.a2.txt,Abolishing of the death penalty,"In a lot of countries the death penalty is still in use. Many people are of the opinion that the death penalty is needed as the only right sentence for exceptionally cruel crimes. I do not share that opinion, mainly because I do not think that any person has the right to kill another human being. There are many reasons why I think the death penalty should be abolished. I will now put my arguments forward and explain why I feel the way I do.
To begin with I don't think that any person should have the right to execute anyone. We are all human beings. An execution, or a state killing, is colder and more premeditated than any of the crimes committed by the convict. Even if a person has committed terrible crimes, and doesn't deserve to live because of all the horrible things he or she has done, it isn't right for any other person to take a life. If we use the death penalty for people who have murdered others, we are as bad as they are. It's not excusable to commit dreadful crimes but neither to execute the one who has. Nobody, either individually nor as a society representative, has the right to take another man's life, even taken in to account the seriousness of his guilt. 
I understand people, who are victims of cruel crimes wanting to see their attacker executed. I also understand relatives of the victim feeling that way, but I do not think that the death penalty is the right solution. When a person has committed a murder or anything like that, I totally agree on that he or she should be put away behind bars to pay for what they have done. 
Secondly I think that a person who has committed a dreadful crime should be locked up for life. I think it's too easy for murderers to get away with being executed, because then they aren't being punished for life like the victim and its relatives. The truth and the remorse remain even when an exceptionally dangerous killer is executed. Also I think it would be better trying to re-educate and rehabilitate the convict morally and humanly. What rehabilitation will be possible towards a dead man? 
Thirdly the death penalty is the ultimate cruel and inhuman punishment existing and it violates the right to life. Not to mention that an execution is an act of violence, and violence tends to provoke violence. You can't prevent killing by killing. I also think it is the duty of every state to protect the life of all persons within its jurisdiction without exception. Executions, whether by governments or others, are equally unacceptable. Abolition of the death penalty is necessary for the achievement of declared international standards.
People who support the death penalty are saying that it is too costly for the taxpayers to have the criminals in prison. The critics, on the other hand, have mentioned the economy as a strong reason for abolishing of the death penalty. Economic studies have shown that it is a very costly procedure to execute people, the way they do in the US for example. 
The cost isn't only financial, the imposition and infliction of the death penalty is brutal to all that are involved in the process. 
My final argument is based on the fact that innocent people could be executed and that is a risk we cannot afford to take. There is always a possibility of miscarriages of justice. The possibility of killing an innocent person alone justifies the abolition of the death penalty. Sometimes people are falsely accused of crimes they haven't committed. It has happened that innocent people have been executed. We are depending on judicial system; a mistake made by an inexperienced lawyer, for example a minor delay in producing evidence for the defence, can cost the defendant's life. This we cannot allow.",0
277,4023.a2.txt,BOY SHOT DOWN IN SCHOOL!,"When did Sweden become a country like any other country in the world? When did we first start to worry about locking our doors while going away to the shop? When did we for the first time feel that we had to take an extra look over our shoulder while walking the dog, to make sure that their would be no one behind us? How did this happen to us in this country that used to be known as one of the greatest and safest countries in the world, and why did this happen? These are questions that one can ask himself when it's over and too late, but yet we have time to change things, it's not all over. My belief is that we have to start this process by looking closer into the school system, after all that is where it all starts.
Recently we've been given shocking news about the situation in Swedish schools, both from media, like newspapers and television, but also locally through neighbours and local authorities. It's when it comes down to this level that people starts to wake up and realise that something isn't right. What is wrong with schools in Sweden today, and what can be done about the problems? Some people believe that the solution is to upgrade the laws that involves the way schools are ran today. To increase the personal safety people are suggesting to have metal detectors be installed in certain schools or let guards patrol the school area to make sure that everyone is safe within the premises. I don't think that is the right way to handle the problem. We have to believe that it's possible to go back in time and find an explanation to when and why things started to drift out of hand. I believe that we make an enormous mistake if we go down the same road as they have done in the US to solve problems, a system where peoples integrity is more or less gone and where the school has given up it's responsibilities to policemen, who now are responsible for the safety and well-being of the students. I do understand that school-boards in schools with difficulties do have to put up with an enormous amount of criticisms from parents and society. They are more or less forced to do something radical about the problems, as quick as possible. I also think that now is the time to stop and think not only one time but twice, before we make a mistake that will leave scars in our nation for ever.
So now I've said that the easy solution is not always the best one. That was very easily said, but to give examples to what could be done instead is not as an easy task. I'm not saying that I know the best way to tackle the problem, but what I do know and what I think is the elementary answer to all the questions that are related to this problem, is that we have to start believing in the goodness of people again. Once we start trusting each other we can start solving the problems we have. To do something like installing metal detectors to make sure that no one goes to school carrying a gun or a knife might solve an indirect problem, that some students for different reasons, actually pass the school entrance with some kind of weapon on them. On the other hand it certainly will not treat the heart of the problem. If you can't trust, you will not be trusted, in this case only held back.
To sum up the content of my message I would like to emphasise upon how important I think it is to not be influenced to much by other countries. We who live together in this country have to build up the kind of trust that we used to hold for each other, starting with that we have to feel good about ourselves. Tell me, who would feel good about themselves if they weren't trusted?",0
278,4024.a2.txt,"The stressful and competitive society of today, is a battle-field unlike any other we have seen in history this far. Due to the higher grade of early specialisation, and the information technology revolution, demands are made on our civilisation like never before. For example, today there is a need in the corporate world for everything to be done by the minute, or rather a day or two in advance. When we first started to realise that only by having a thoroughly rested body, with no distracting ailments, would we be able to cope with such requests and the hectic society, we saw a boom in the field of ergonomic design - as was the case in the end of the twentieth century. However, that was only the first few staggering steps towards a more humane situation. I would in this essay, in an additional move to improve these conditions, like to argue that everybody should be entitled to a bed adjusted to their individual ergonomic and orthopaedic needs - even to the extent that it should be made compulsory.","If we look at the world today, we see two widespread national illnesses of which we have not seen much before, namely stress and tension. Although these conditions may not qualify as diseases, their consequences might very well indeed, and though there may be many ways of avoiding them theoretically, the best way practically is to get good and sufficient sleep. It is psychologically proved that lack of sleep impair the span of concentration, makes you easily irritated and can even lead you to misinterpret sensory impressions. Nevertheless when your body is relaxed and you are rested you get a lighter disposition, you become more resistant to stress and it is less likely you will suffer from any kind of irritating ailments. All of this is thus achievable with a bed which provides you with satisfactorily sleep.

What is more, an orthopaedic bed will lessen back aches and relieve already sore backs, and this, too, will heighten your ability to deal with the contemporary society. Since back aches are hard to escape due to the fact that evolution has not yet completely adjusted our body structure to an upright position, a supporting bed would provide against this totally unnecessary frustration, which could lead to a graver condition later in life.

Even critics would agree with me, I am sure, that having an ergonomic bed would reduce such occupational injuries as stress, tension and back aches since there is proof of this in a number of independent surveys. Nevertheless, they would claim that although this is a wonderful idea, it could never become compulsory. For example, how would it be implemented? Should there be a law to it, not only putting restrictions to our freedom of choice, but to the market's as well. Besides such a law would be impossible to uphold. Furthermore, there would be no economic ground for it.

Of course, the idea of a law prohibiting the use of a bad bed is absurd. But a reform towards a better bed for everybody is still a possibility. Simply, if the government would make a calculation of what was to be gained from the decreasing expenses in physiotherapy, sickness benefits and early retirement pensions, this money could be used to encourage the bed-making industry to introduce a standardisation of bed designs. That could then be used by the public medical service, which would receive government funding too, to help you to find out which kind of bed suited you the best, together with your medical examinations. This would leave the market free to compete beyond the standardisation, and it would make it easier for you to find an orthopaedic bed adjusted to you.

In conclusion, we have to do what we can to reduce the present amount of stress, tension, ailments and back aches we are facing. As we learn that this could be done with a reform based on government funding to the bed-making industry and the public medical service, which would make it easier for you to get a bed adjusted to your individual needs by way of a standardisation of bed designs, we should do all we can to implement this idea. Not to would be absolutely neglectful to a society in need, and all would gain if the world of tomorrow was a more harmonic place than the hectic one of today.",0
279,4025.a2.txt,Why we should introduce free massage as a working benefit,"Surely all of us have been struck by stress and exhaustion sometime during our lives. But these phenomena are getting more and more common and overwhelming. Many people today suffer a great deal from stress and from getting burned out. These problems do not only concern adults, but also many schoolchildren. Fortunately there are ways to help prevent these so called national diseases. For example, one easy way is through massage, which is a well-known means of relaxing and recovery. This method has been used by people in centuries. My opinion is that every employee should be offered free massage as a part of their working benefits. And since other forms of healthcare are free for people under the age of twenty, massage should be free for them as well. Thus how can everyone benefit from this idea, and how will this improve our everyday lives?

To begin with, more and more people are having difficulties with performing a good job at their work, because of factors such as stress and exhaustion. This is not hard to understand since our society is a rapidly developing one, and as a result the demands on our efficiency increase. Many of us work so hard that we are totally exhausted when we come home. As if this is not enough there are a number of duties at home that many of us have to deal with after work. There is simply no time for relaxation. Now, if everyone were to be offered free massage, say once a week at the least, we would become much more relaxed and as a result we would be able to work more effectively. Less people would suffer from stress and, in addition to this, our working environment would become more pleasant and more people would enjoy going to work. 

However, I do not believe that adults are the only group in need of relaxation in the form of massage. Schoolchildren also suffer a lot from stress and this puts a strain on their concentration and learning ability. Massage, as we all know, not only makes us feel more relaxed, but it increases our blood circulation, and makes us feel more alert. Through massage we can concentrate better and we become more active. This will, in the long run, lead to better educated children, and they will not forget what they learn at school.

Of course these massage treatments have to be financed. Nevertheless, in my opinion there will be no big problems financing this project, since the effects of the massage treatments in themselves will be moneysaving. This money can then be used to pay for the expenses. The companies will save money because they will have employees who are more relaxed and therefore can concentrate better and work more effectively. They will do a better job in less time! Furthermore, people will have a better health, and there will be less people on the sick- leave. Thus, the government will not have to pay as much sick benefits, and could instead use this money to sponsor the project. 

To sum up, I would like to se free massage in the form of a working benefit, because I believe that this would be one great step in the right direction in order to improve peoples health, both physically and mentally. What we need today is a form of relaxation in our stressful lives. As we all know, when we feel relaxed we see the good things in life, we are nicer to one another, and we feel good about our selves. For instance, the body as well as the mind will get stronger, and as a result of this we will be able to resist diseases and handle difficult situations a lot better. In addition to this we will perform better at work and at school.",0
280,4026.a2.txt,A modern monarchy,"Sweden has been a monarchy for a very long time. In fact, our history is to a large extent connected with the different kings and queens that have ruled the country. Even though the boundaries have changed several times due to wars, conflicts and unions our monarchy has persevered. The role of the monarch has however seen a huge transformation over the last two hundred years and the powers of Gustav II Adolf or Karl XII cannot be compared with those of the present king Carl XIV Gustav. 
The parliament is today the main legislative and ruling body with the government being the second with the Supreme Court being separated from political influence. It does not deal with political matters or interfere with the laws passed by the parliament. The powers listed above all belonged to the monarch a little longer than two hundred years ago. The king or queen was the lawmaker, commander of the armed forces and the main ruler of the nation. Swedish kings are famous of their warfare with neighbouring counties and battles throughout northern Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, however, the situation is completely different today where the monarch's powers have been reduced to none as a consequence of the parliamentary movements of the 19th century. 
In 1809, the first reform took place when dissatisfied generals set the king aside and the monarch's powers were reduced and shared with different ruling bodies. Fifty years later a reform was passed that changed the foundation of the class-based parliament to a parliament based on income and property. The monarch's power was not changed dramatically during these years but a process had started that would eventually relieve the monarch of his former duties. The new form of government had come to grow strong and it was now the parliament that became the new ruling body in domestic and international matters. 
As the parliament took over the responsibility of ruling the country it was expected of the monarch to stay neutral and not to express himself in political matters. Despite this fact king Gustav V chose in 1914 not to agree with the existing prime minister, as a result of this controversy the prime minister resigned. Since then there have been no further utterances in political matters form the monarch and we expect the him to keep a low profile, even in non-political matters even though it is claimed by some people that the present king and queen are strong leaders of opinion in different matters such as hunting and child-pornography. 
The king and queen of Sweden are today merely representatives of the country who appear on official state visits and also travel around the world creating good relations with other countries and putting Sweden on the map. There is no power at all to talk about and the monarch simply receives a salary that will enable him to carry out his duties as a representative of our country. 
 The opposition, the critics of the monarchy, claim that it is old-fashioned and not equivalent with the modern society and also that it is expensive for the taxpayers. I don't find this sort of criticism very well considered. Firstly, Sweden is a very old country and the monarchy is a big part of our history as well as our identity. I think it is quite unique living in a country where we still have a monarchy because there are not many countries that are monarchies today. When it comes to the question of democracy and the modern day society the monarch does not have any political power as seen above, all those powers have been taken away from the monarch and been put in the hands of the people. This fact shows henceforth that a monarchy really can exist within the boundaries of a modern democracy. Secondly, the argument saying that it is expensive to uphold and support the royal family's living expenses does not seem to hold ground. Compared to other expenses it is a very small fraction of the tax money that is paid. Repairing or rebuilding the monarch's residences would add up to a big sum of money up front but it is hardly noticeable in the big economy and besides we pay so much taxes in this country that you would not be able to see the difference. Thirdly, and as a final thought, if we were to abolish the monarchy in Sweden, what would the tabloids write about?",0
281,4027.a2.txt,NUCLEAR POWER vs. NATURAL SOURCES OF POWER.,"The ongoing debate, on nuclear power vs. natural sources of power has never been such a burning issue as today. This question concerns all of us and it is our responsibility to raise people's awareness of this topic. Is nuclear power really the only and the safest way to get power (electricity) to the homes and industries of Sweden? Should we, in the 21th century rely on such an insecure source of power? Are we ready to risk our children's life getting electricity? Are the Swedish nuclear power stations really as secure as we are told? While presenting the pros and cons of different sources of power, I will state my side in the debate and try to answer these burning questions. In this essay I will argue against the use of nuclear power, in all-current methods of using. It might have been the best alternative at the time it was introduced, and voted for, but today we have developed more modern and environment-friendly ways of providing for Sweden's, and other countries, need for electricity. 
We are told that nuclear power is the most safe, cheap and reliable way of keeping Sweden running. But is it really so? If you see to the side effects, nuclear power is very much a defective source of power. First of all, nuclear fission in itself is a very insecure and inadequate method of gaining power (electricity); every single fission is indeed an uncontrolled explosion. For example, a computer programmer agency got commissioned to investigate the weaknesses of the safety system at a nuclear power station in Sweden and after some research they came up with some five-hundred different situations were the safety system would be inadequate and brake down. Secondly, there is the contaminated nuclear waste to take care of and store for hundreds of years in the bedrock. Everything that has contact with the toxic waste must be stored and kept safe form leakage. The thought of what could happen if the toxic waste got into our ground water or spread in the nature is disastrous, not to mention that the staff working with nuclear waste is at constant risk of nuclear radiation, which is a source of diseases and health problems. Finally, the economic issue is indeed important, and the price of electricity needs to be questioned. Nuclear power is a very expensive way of getting power; nuclear power stations are expensive to built, the Uranium that is most commonly used for nuclear fission is expensive, and you can only use it once. A way of financing this expensive source of power could be for Sweden to raise the price for electricity, as we are one of, not to say the, cheapest country for electric support. With a way of choosing the source from which the electricity to your home came, it is likely that many Swedes would be ready to pay a little more (that means a little more than 0.20-0.50kr/kWh) to be able to dismantle some nuclear power stations. I would, that's for sure, and I'm sure many with me. 
However, rather than raising electricity prices, an important step would be to investigate our need for electricity. If every sixth Swede turned off one lamp in every room he/she did not use at the moment, we could be able to shut down two of four nuclear reactors at Oskarshamn nuclear power station. The consumers' money could then be used to build up alternative power stations. For as the situation is today, Sweden is not ready to just shut down the nuclear power stations. Our alternatives are not good enough yet. The time of transmission will probably take many years, but the sooner we begin, the sooner we can turn to a totally changed system.
Besides considering saving electricity, we need to develop alternative energy sources. Natural sources of power like wind, water and sun, are good alternatives. At first, water power does to some extent disturb the natural balance of a river, but it can naturally never be compared with the destruction that might be caused by nuclear power. The supply of hydroelectric power depends on the annual precipitation - rain or snow, and to be depending on the capricious weather is always a risk, and therefor an argument against the use of hydro power. But it is time introduce the best part of nature power recourses; they are all a complement to each other. That is to say, you need rain to get electricity from water power, but when it doesn't rain, it will, probably and hopefully, be sunshine, which means that we can gain power (and electricity) from the sun, which is indeed an inexhaustible source of power. To just rely on sun power is nothing that we should consider in Sweden, because of the cold and mostly rainy summers, but as a complement, it is both environmentally friendly and costly effective. Wind power is also an inexhaustible source of power. 
A common argument against the introduction of wind power is that the tall pylons destroy the landscape, but we have to ask ourselves if not that is a reasonable price compared to the shape and condition the landscape would be in if there were a nuclear power station brake down. Moreover, none of those natural sources of power; water, sun and wind, is one by one an alternative to nuclear power, but if we complemented, and developed, all those three together, would more or less cover the energy that we today gain from nuclear power. 

To sum up, while we cannot just dismantle all the nuclear reactors at once, we have to gradually decrease the use of nuclear energy. We have to be ready to work and pay for a future without nuclear power stations, even if the work just might be turning off lamps, TV sets, and toasters, knowing that the extra money saved is for building an alternative power future.",0
282,4028.a2.txt,Do YOU eat Meat?,"I often get the question why I don't eat meat. I didn't stop because of the cruel treatment of animals all around the world, but because I felt that I actually didn't need to eat meat. I won't starve or get malnourished if I don't. Since I stopped I have heard so much about many animals horrible life and all because of humans desire for meat, or money. When I now get the question why I don't eat meat, I only want to answer -Why do you eat meat? 
Animals are maltreated in many parts of the world even in Sweden. Gene engineered animals are brought up to become bigger and grow faster for a mass production of meat. Cruel animal transports are nothing unknown to anybody. Cattle are many times transported with no respect for their life during horrible conditions. Many horses, mainly racehorses without a great talent are sold to the butcher, not always in Sweden. The mad cow disease has now been spread out in many countries as a result of meat based foodstuff that had been infected. (I thought that cows were grass eaters?) In this part of the world everybody could today get more than enough nutrition without eating meat, maybe it could stop this madness and lack of respect for the animals.
Everybody has heard about Belgian Blue, the genetic engineered cows that grow really fast and become abnormally big. The grown up cows have a hard time to move at all because they are to heavy. The calves have to be taken out by a caesarean section because it would kill the cow to give birth the ""normal"" way. Those big cows look like living beefs more than animals and they are suffering from it. What is it good for? In Denmark they have brought up chickens that grow so fast that they after a couple of weeks, many of them, can't stand on their own legs anymore, the ones that could were linking around. On the documentary where I heard about this, they were giving the chickens painkillers to see if they were in pain. The chickens walked a lot better under the influence of the drug...
On a radio program last week they were talking about horses from Sweden that got transported to butchers in Italy, as that would give more money than to sell them to a Swedish butcher. It was about two thousand horses per year going this way from Sweden. The horses were sometimes very bad kept before they left as they anyway were going to get killed, it even happened that some of them couldn't manage the whole way, but died during the transport. Anyway horses are mainly in good care as they have other more important functions to people than to be eaten by us.
The mad cow disease is a fact that has stopped many people from eating meat. The scientists don't really know how it can or has effected people, already many people chiefly on Ireland has died from the brain disease Creutzfelt Jacob that has a connection with consumption of infected meat. They don't know yet but they also think that the symptoms of the disease can show up many years after that you ate the infected meat. Why do cows eat meat based food anyway? Humans decided that cows should eat food made of other cows, then I don't think it is very strange that those weird kind of diseases shows up. It is so far from cows' natural diet of grass that you can get.
My main point is always to try to avoid unnecessary suffering for animals. I choose not to eat meat and I don't support maltreatment of animals in anyway. Farmers and other animal owners or animal dealers have to take better care of their animals and make sure that the transportation to the butcher won't be long and painful. I know that many do take care of their animals very well but it is all those extreme stories that scares me, that some people can have such a lack of respect for the animals. The many facts about animals' situations today strengthened my opinion that I made the right decision when I stopped my meat consumption. - Do you eat meat?",0
283,4029.a2.txt,The distribution revolution,"A burning issue in the world of music distribution today is the existence and usage of the computer program Napster. With the help of this program it is possible to share music files with other users of the program. The company behind Napster provides a database in which the users can search for what they want to download. The download itself is preformed only between two ordinary computers connected to the Internet. As the music is shared between private computers it's hard to control if the copyright of the music is violated. This is where the record companies come in. They don't like the fact that their music is freely available on the Internet without their control. To protect their interests several record companies has filed a lawsuit against Napster in order to get the service stopped. It has not been stopped yet but Napster is probably going to get stopped in the near future. I don't think the record companies are doing exactly the right thing. I think that record companies should collaborate with Napster and use their technology as a new way to distribute music.
My main argument for that the record companies should use this new technology is that it's impossible to stop this development with music sharing on the Internet. The Napster community has today about 51 million registered users and if it's suddenly stopped it will result in a huge demand for something to replace it. Programs with almost the same functionality as Napster already exist and it probably wouldn't take long before Napster would be fully replaced.
Because of the reason that I just mentioned it's better to cooperate with Napster than just to stop it. I'm not saying that the illegal copying of copyright protected music is going to end but this is a very good opportunity for the music industry to reduce it and at the same time make profit form it. As Napster is such a widely spread program it makes it a good foundation for use as a new distribution channel. Napster would naturally have to be transformed into a membership-based community where the members either pays a membership fee or pay for the music that they download.
Another side of the issue is the users, which I haven't mentioned yet. They will be forced to pay for something that previously has been free of charge. Naturally quite a lot of the users will stop using the service, but the ones who are willing to pay will see that it's not only a bad thing that they have to pay. If the users are forced to pay I think it's the record companies responsibility to make all their music available on the service. Then the users would have a much bigger selection of music that always would be available for download. In addition to that the sound quality of the music would be better as the only one who would publish music on the service would be the record companies which has access to better equipment than an ordinary home user.
The scenario that I have pictured is actually beginning to happen. The big German media conglomerate Bertelsmann, of which a main part is the big BMG record company, has signed an agreement with Napster. This agreement is aiming towards a membership based community just as the one I have been discussing, but how this is going to be designed has not yet been decided. If this agreement becomes a success then Bertelsmann will drop the lawsuit that they currently have against Napster. I hope that all the other record companies will follow Bertelsmann's example and join them and Napster to create a community where all music is available for download. This would in the beginning only be a complement to how music is distributed today, but I believe that it's one step forward towards a different way to distribute music in the future.",0
284,4030.a2.txt,SMOKING OR NON-SMOKING?,"Imagine a night out, you have had a few drinks, done a bit of dancing and are now in bed ready to go to sleep feeling quite satisfied with the evening. When you wake up next morning with (probably) a hangover and a smell in your hair, your clothes and bed, witch can be defined as tobacco smell., you do not feel as glamorous as you did last night. The hangover is (of course) your own fault, but the smell if you are a non-smoker?
Is it really reasonable that other people has the power to endanger your health? Should you not be the one to decide about your own future? The right thing to do would be to ban smoking at night clubs and pubs all over the country. This might not be an easy task, so my aim would be the nations in Uppsala, since I know that it is possible.

The main reason to why there should be no- smoking at the nations, is the danger that comes along with smoking. To begin with; smoking can give you several diseases, the most severe one being cancer. Secondly there is always the danger of fire. Most of the nations are situated in old buildings where the risk of fire are great. Just by flicking your cigarettebump not put out onto a couch or the floor, etc. could start a fire, and with alcohol, often consumed on a night out, comes poor judgment so this happens very often. Surely the nations are provided with fire- extinguishers but that is not enough protection, since the nations usually are overcrowded on a Friday night. Of course this is something the nations should take under consideration anyway and not just with the smoking issue.

Furthermore what happened to the free will? It is said that each and every person has their own free will to make a decision, but this is not the case here. Diseases through smoking does not just affect smokers, but also non- smokers, who through inhaling the smoke from others can just as easily and sometimes easier get cancer or asthma This fact makes my statement even clearer thinking of the people working for instance behind the bar, waitresses, waiters and DJ's even. Although they might be smokers themselves they should be able to decide how much they want to smoke and the fact is that someone has to work in order to keep the place running. Let us not forget another important group of people- the people who is allergic to smoke and those with severe asthma. These people cannot go to these, places in order to stay healthy and alive and this is all because of the smoke which is not fair. Why should smokers make other people, although not on purpose, stay away? Oddly enough people continue to smoke even though they know that they are endangering themselves and others.

Fortunately there is a solution to everything and of course to this problem as well. To begin with, why not just prohibit smoking at the nations? It has been tested in several cities for example Ume√•, Eskilstuna and V√§ster√•s and it has worked out beautifully. Norrlands nation in Uppsala has actually banned smoking in some parts of the building so that is a step in the right direction. Disregarding this as a solution at least have one room where people can smoke and no one else had to suffer. Although this solution might not be perfect at least it is better then the current situation. A few days ago my friends and I went to Stockholms nation to have lunch and left after an hour with the stench of tobacco in our hair and clothes even though neither one of us smoked during that time. The smell was probably there from the night before or even earlier. However, we still want to go back in spite of the smell, because the food is nice The question is, would someone allergic to smoke or with asthma be able to have lunch there if only just for an hour?

In short banning smoking at the nations can only have a positive outcome regarding the health situation for non- smokers, which includes staff, visitors and of course for the smokers as well. I myself tend to smoke a cigarette or two sometimes on a night out and would be more than happy to smoke it outside.",0
285,4032.a2.txt,An idea on how to bring social justice to the school curriculum,"In a time when racism is growing amongst young people and words such as social Justice seems erased from our vocabulary it is of great importance to look at what role the school plays in the discussion and creation of attitudes. I believe the schools can and should play a more active part in bringing back social Justice on the agenda. What I am proposing is therefore the introduction during the last year of junior high school of a compulsory stay in a foreign country. I suggest that all Swedish high school students spend approximately one semester in a foreign country preferably outside of Western Europe, taking part in social projects such as building schools, helping with irrigation projects, working with the homeless or in women shelters etc. I suggest this project be funded with tax money. This idea might at first seem overly radical and somewhat unrealistic. But I will here argue that the tax money spent on this project will pay back greatly maybe not so much in economical terms but in terms of gains for both the individual as well as for the society at large.

With the risk of sounding as a hopelessly outdated idealist I will not start with the economical gains (if there indeed are any) or the gains for the society but with how the individual student would benefit from this proposal. The first individual gain that come to mind is the students own personal growth. What better way to learn about yourself, learn responsibility and improve your self confidence than to travel and meet people from other cultures? I believe it is the schools ambition not only to teach the students facts but also other skills such as being able to take initiatives and ability to work in a group. This is an area where, judging from the present school debate, schools seem to have difficulties and are in need of new ideas. I believe a compulsory semester spent abroad is an innovating idea worth trying. Apart from being exposed to a different culture the students would also be exposed to a different language. Today when a lot of stress is being put on language skills in order to get a job, I see it as a good investment both for the individual and for the society at large to early on learn high school students to communicate in a second language. Therefore I think it is essential to make sure everybody gets this opportunity.

I will now move on to look at what positive effects this suggested proposal would have on society. One of the major gains that come to mind is that it would help in the fight against racism. This is of course only a speculation from my side but I see it as a rather logic result if people at an early age were to be confronted with other cultures and social situations. Not only do I think it would be an efficient way to meet the growing racism but it would hopefully also raise the awareness of the importance of social Justice. I am by no means suggesting this to be the only solution but I do think it to be one way of dealing with two substantial problems our society is struggling with today; racism and a lack of interest in global social Justice. Looking beyond our own country it would also be beneficial for the receiving country, taken that the students would not merely be spectators but would actively be taking part in the different projects.

Since everything today in order to be trustworthy has to be measured in economic terms I will venture to speculate that this idea is not only good for the individual and for society at large but can also be economically sustainable. As good as every day we read about the scarcity of qualified teachers, the physical decay of our school buildings and the lack of updated schoolbooks. With a large number of students (everyone in their final semester of junior high school) abroad every year the demand for schoolbooks and teachers would decrease. There would of course still be a need for some teachers to keep in contact with the students while abroad and to follow up at home coming. But the actual number of teachers could be reduced. It is also my conviction that this last ""abroad spent"" semester would be a good incentive for students to finish junior high school and therefore the number of dropouts would be reduced. Which apart from being good for the individual students also would have a good effect on the economy since more people would complete their studies and be more attractive on the job market.

As you have seen I believe there to be many good reasons, both for society and for the students to introduce a compulsory stay abroad for the students in junior high school. I have even suggested in what way this could have a beneficial effect on the economy, even though my lack of economic training makes these assumptions rather speculative. But I believe that even if we, in order to implement this idea, would have to increase the taxes both the society, the school and the students have enough to gain that it would be well worth it.",0
286,4033.a2.txt,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT,"Capital punishment is used in some parts of the United States, and in a number of other countries around the world. In these countries the state is legally killing people who have committed murders. In other words, killing a person is legal if the person in question has killed another person. I would say that it is not morally defensible to kill a person because of a crime he or she has committed.

Instead of executing murderers I think that it is our duty to help them. Those who need societys help the most are those who commit crimes. They would not commit murders if they were not mentally ill in some way. If they are mentally ill, they need our help and we should not kill them. Some criminals may have had a very problematic and complicated childhood. They may have been badly brought up and so commit crimes. Everyone has a history that makes him or her to do such bad things to others. No human being kills another without such reasons. I can not believe that a normal person just walk along the streets and shoots someone just like that. Murderers, who do this, are ill in some way and we should help these people instead of punishing them. I do not say that a problematic past or being mentally ill is an excuse for committing a crime, but that they need our help. There is a proverb, which says: ""Love me the most, when I deserve it the least, for that is when I need it the most"". If we help criminals to get on the right track, they might change. Everyone can change for the better and the least we can do is give him or her the chance. We must help them get on the right track and not execute them before they are given the chance. 

Everyone has the right to live. The right to live is the most fundamental human right of all and you can not legally take this human right away >from any person. You can not say that anyone deserves to die, no one does. We all have the right to live, no matter who we are. As I said, I really think that every person can change for the better. Bur of course, taking care of all prisoners will cost society a lot of money. But is not human life worth more than money? I think that a human life is worth so much, no matter what! The persons who get executed have committed murder themselves, but still you cant execute the person because of this. If society had offered them help earlier they might not have killed anyone at all. No matter what it costs to get the criminals well again, we must get them well anyway. We must help each other, no matter what it will cost. When I was little my mother always said to me: ""You are worth your weight in gold"". That is how much we all are worth. We cant value money to human life. To value anything before human life is wrong. We must help prisoners to get on the right track, no matter what crime he or she has committed or no matter how much it will cost us. 

No person may have the right to kill another human being, no matter how serious the crime is that the person has committed. Why should society execute a murderer in revenge for the persons criminal past? What will that lead to for the population in the country involved and for humanity as a whole? I would say that it would not lead us anywhere. You cant solve anything by murdering the murderer. Nothing will ever change if we continue to kill each other. If we want to live in a peaceful environment, we must stop the killing, not legalize it.

I can understand the anger within a person whose friend or relative has been murdered. In some ways I can understand their obsession to kill that person in revenge. I also understand that they do not want to help the murderer to improve his or her life, since he or she has murdered someone close to you. I can understand all of this, but still I do not think it is right to execute the murderer. Instead I think we should help each other to make this world a better place for all. We will never have a safe society for our children to grow up in if we legalize killing and continue to execute the murderers in revenge. We must not kill each other! It is not ethically right! I am totally against capital punishment and I think we must abolish it.",0
287,4035.a2.txt,Time for a law against Tobacco,"One of the most powerful methods of getting rid of dangerous threats to society, is to make laws for protective purposes. For instance, we have laws to make traffic safer, and we have laws that forbids ordinary people from carrying guns. We also have laws that makes a clear statement regarding narcotics. And yet we have no law protecting us from the most popular, and therefore perhaps the most dangerous drug of them all, and that is of course tobacco. There can be little doubt, that a law that makes the sale and use of every form of tobacco illegal, is of the utmost importance.

It is a well known fact that tobacco is hazardous to people's health. But there is not only the commonly known riscs of cancer and severe heart conditions that should cause worry. I once saw a list of the damage that tobacco may inflict upon a human body. At least a hundred deceases were listed, and almost every part of the body was mentioned. Furthermore this list showed that tobacco is not only causing physical illness. A person might also get various psychical disfunctions from using tobacco, such as sleeping problems and depression to mention a few. Needless to say perhaps, the healthproblems that comes from tobacco, are not of the kind that can be cured overnight. Every year more people die from deceases directly related to using tobacco, than from anything else. And before they die these thousands of people suffering from tobaccorelatd deseases occupies already overcrowded hospitals, making it not only a healthissue, but a financial matter, as well.

There is of course a considerable amount of taxmoney to be saved here. At the present, we have an ongoing debate over the shortage of healthcare money, and still we allow a great deal of that money to be eaten up by costs caused by tobacco. This gives us an equation that is easy enough to solve. With a law against tobacco there would be no such expense. And we all know that the money is well needed elsewhere in a country's healthcare system. We also have endless expensive goverment campaigns advicing us not to use tobacco. Again money that could be easily saved simply by a law prohibiting tobacco. There are people arguing that the state actually have a taxincom on tobacco. Such arguments are of course complete and utter nonsense. The money the state gain on taxes from the sale of tobacco may be the equivalent of a mere few percent of what the tobacco is costing in healthcare. 

Finally I would like to emphazise on the thought of our forthcoming generations, and their growth in a society were a drug like tobacco, that really has no purpose apart from being a danger to their health, still has not been made illegal. A common answer to the question, why a person is using tobacco, is simply that the person for some reason once tried it and from that day is unable to stop. That only shows that by passing a law that bans tobacco, we can take away the possibility of that fatal first try to be exposed to our children. Every day passing is another day, where thousands of young people take up ""the bad habit"". And every such day should be considered a failure on our part, in terms of showing proper respect to the next generation.

The next generation deserves this law. Arguments concerning health and finance clearly says that we should have one. So let us not hesitate any longer. Let us in the name of common sense, by law state that we have understood the folishness of allowing tobacco. Let us show the responsibility one has the right to expect from a civilized society. It is, and has been ever since tobacco was first tried by man, time to pass the law that bans tobacco.",0
288,4036.a2.txt,STATE CARE CANNOT REPLACE FAMILY CARE,"Society has failed of taking satisfactory care of the elderly. Municipals are not able to provide its old inhabitants apartments and even as I write, some five thousand of them stand without proper living arrangements. It's also known that this group is steadily growing in our society. More and more money and recourses are needed. At the same time the number of those being in working life declines. I think that the best solution to this problem is that families themselves provide care for their older members, at least in some extent.
Would you like to spend the last years of your life sitting in a closet-size room, only having the next bingo session to look forward to? I assume you wouldn't. This is however reality for many elderly today. Growing old is something one almost ought to feel ashamed of. Perhaps if we spent more time with the elderly and took care of them ourselves, maybe then we would once again learn not to be afraid of ageing and instead we might, just might, realise that good things also come with it, namely experience and wisdom.
The benefits this would bring to the elderly themselves are easily imagined. Every one of us has the basic need for feeling useful, preferable to some other human being. Grandma could assist in some lighter every-day chores, such as minding her grandchildren. It would certainly be nice for her to now that someone still needs her and enjoys her company. A very nice side effect of this would be the children then being able to stay a little longer in a warm and safe home environment instead of being sent away to day care institutions as early as at the age of one, not to mention all those things they could learn from the older generation. 
Let's return to the closet-sized rooms and the obvious lack of something to occupy the residents with. I'm sure that those who work at these institutions and homes are very capable craftsmen and that they do the best they can. They are indeed able to provide for their customers basic needs. Still, there simply isn't enough time for social interaction such as sitting down for a talk, mainly due to the lack of staff.
To make it possible for families to have their parents at home, the time spent at work ought to be shortened. Regarding the situation today there isn't even enough time to spend with ones children after a long eight- hour day at work. If this was done there would automatically be more openings in the job- market and unemployment figures would go down. Society would save that huge amount of money that goes to maintain all these institutions and could preferably transfer some of the saved money to the equally huge healthcare costs. As long as any diseases don't trouble the old member of the family, care at home is to prefer, but professionals of course better give medical care. 
As I have shown so far there are great benefits both individually and socially. I'm sure though, that you already have formed some counter arguments in your mind. One of them might be how we are supposed to manage economically if we only work six hours per day? With more mouths to fill there has to be an increase in income as well. But then again, one might wonder if we really need to consume as much as we do today? Couldn't we try lowering our cost of living? Surely it's not all that important to have the most expensive house, car and so forth? 
I'm well aware of that in order to make these suggestions come true we would probably have to go some hundred years back in time. We have somehow lost our feeling of belonging together as families. Partly I would like to blame the society we are living in for that; the haunt for money and success has made us greedy and egoistic. However it's extremely important for preserving humanity that we once again start taking care of each other!",0
289,4037.a2.txt,NO TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF XENOTRANSPLANTATION,"Just a couple hundreds of the 90 000 people who die in Sweden every year donate their organs. This has lead to longer queues and time of waiting for transplantation of organs. And it is calculated that 15-20 percent of those on the waiting list will die before a suitable organ becomes available. As a solution to this problem are some scientists working on research on xenotransplantation, which means to move organs between different species. In this case to move organs between pigs and human beings. The thought is to gene manipulate pigs to get them suitable as donors of organs. So in future transplantations it would be possible to replace human tissue with pigs' cells and organs. But unfortunately there are to many risks and much unfairness connected with it. Therefor I think xenotransplantation is not the right solution on the lack of organs and it should not be developed either.
First of al I am against the development of xenotransplantation because it entails risks such as transmission of unknown viruses and other infectious diseases from the pigs to the human body. Of course, some complications could be acceptable though the receiver of a pig organ may get higher life quality, but an infection could be contagious for the people nearest the patient and possibly even to society. Therefore I would prefer another solution to the lack of organs. Public information about the lack of organs and discussions about the consequences of xenotransplantation would help. I think a lot of people would change their mind if they were informed. The problem with the lack of organs should also be presented for children at school so that they from an early age get used on the thought of donating their organs. That way more people would be ready to donate their organs and such need for organs that exist today would not exist.
Another reason to why I am against the development of xenotransplantation is the thought on how xenotransplantation could be used by the companies that have spent money on research on xenotransplantation. I mean that those who are going to be the sellers of the gene manipulated pig organs will try to make big business on them without carrying on the ethical consequences. One must realise that those companies are not charitable institutions, and that it is therefore possible that poor people in the third world would not have access to these organs, which would lead to an increase of injustice in our world. This make me wonder: Who would indeed be most benefited by xenotransplantation? Would it be the patient, the seller, the whole society or no one? I think the most benefited would be the seller and the less the patient, by being infected by viruses or similar diseases, and society with the increasing of injustice as a consequence of the greed of the sellers. In this case xenotransplantation does not fill any function and should not therefore exist. 
Another thing that makes me critical against xenotransplantation is that the ""donator-pigs"" are exposed to a lot of pain. They suffer when they are used as patients in experimental transplantations with a lot of medicine that restrains the immune defence. Even genetical operations are painful for the pigs. The pigs used for xenotransplantation are not able to live a happy pig life either, as they are not allowed to root on the ground. I believe that humans do not have the right to change animals' genes and living conditions to get them suitable as donors of organ. We must think about how we would like to be treated ourselves and we should stoop utilising animals the way xenotransplantation does. 
What I have mentioned above are some of the reasons why I do not like to see xenotransplantation as the solution to the lack of organs. The development of xenotransplantation is too dangerous since pig's viruses could infect people. It is unfair since the sellers' greed would lead to an increase of injustice in our world. It is unfair, also, because it causes much pain for the pigs. I believe that if people who do not want to donate their organs reflect on their decision and change their mind it would be easier to stop the development of xenotransplantation and all the bad consequences of it.",0

The most important thing in a country are you - the people. The people who together make the society work. Unfortunely, there are people who have fallen out of the system - people in poverty. Some of them don't even have a home. I can't afford to give them all a new home - but I do want to give them a second chance. I want more shelters to be build and I want to introduce a program where people in poverty can be brought back to a decent way of living. Let us all help each other!

To help another human being is one of the best things you can do in life. Today there is a place where just a little help would turn it out to a much safer and nicer place. I'm talking about a place we all know - the school. My solution is very simple - I want the older pupils to look after the younger pupils. Everyone should from the first day in school have an older friend who helps them, when help is needed. They should also have some classes together to get to know each other. The age difference should only be a year. I'm positive to the fact that in this way the school will be a place where we learn from the beginning to respect and take care of each other. Let us all help each other!

In this country there are a lot of people from all over the world. We may not all come from America, but we all do live in America. The way we treat each other sometimes, because of our different country of origin is frightening. We must start acting against this and realize that all the different nationalities are a part of the new American culture. Therefore I'm going to introduce a program that will imply ways to stop the segregation and it will be easier for the ""new Americans"" to be a part of the new America. We are all a part of this country and we should all have the same rights - no matter what. Let us all help each other!

I want to help you, the people of America. That is my ambition. To help people who needs help the most - the poor, the children in school and the ""new Americans"". Unfortunely there is an obstacle in my way to accomplish all my plans. My worst enemy is not my political ideology it is the fact that I am a woman. I'm paid attention more to the fact that I am a woman, than what I'm actually saying. I want you, the people of America to listen to me, without you I would be nothing. With your support, I'm standing on the shoulders of giants. Together we can make anything happen. My name is Hilary Clinton and I want you to help me to achieve my goal - to become the president of the United States. Thank you and God bless you.",0
291,4040.a2.txt,Can you feel the scent of paper in our Electronic world?,"Book (originally a disk made of wood with carved writing), stitched pages, with writing or printing beyond a certain amount of pages. The limit between books and stitched booklet is vague (the minimal number of pages within the library society is in general about 30 and 100). (Bonniers Lexikon 1966:2)
 In our practical time we have come up with practical inventions. Therefor almost all of us have computers in our homes. Some computers we don't even know we have! They are inside the electrical machines we have, the things that are supposed to make our life easy and filled with pleasure. Some of the things are very nice to have around. Still, I want you to think of a home without all these things, wouldn't it be kind of practical? Not a lot of things braking down all the time! I'm not saying that we shall clear out our homes from all of the ""needful"" gadget we do have. No, I'm only saying that maybe we should say stop. Stop, to the things that take out the pleasures of our lives. For example the electric book. It is nothing more than a screen, with buttons, were you turn page. A book that is not indeed a book. 
 A book it self is like a old friend, that is, a book that you like. It is never less true, that you may not like all of you so called old friends either. Still it is still a good feeling to know that you have them around. A book can be like a lover. You can't wait until you lie down with it and escape from the everyday life. It wouldn't be the same thing to bring the computer to the bed. There is nothing romantic about a computer (now I can imagine that a lot of people don't agree with me. But as a side track I would like to mention that a romance over the internet is a big illusion by it self. You get to know a character in a book a great deal better than a person over the net). To return to the old friend, isn't it true that you look at your bookcase with something that can be described as legitimated pride? These books are your friends, you have read them, you know them. You may not know all of them by name, but you know that they are there for you if you need them.
 I have only mentioned the things that have with feelings to do. But we are not to forget the health aspect of this issue. We know that computers, telephones and televisions are a centre of radiation. And we do expose our body with this radiation that has, with the electronic lifestyle, become a part of our lives. There is not conclusive evidence that speak for that we get cancer from computers and phones. Still we should not be subject to radiant power more than necessary. A book can never harm you in any way (if you don't get cut by one of the pages). To read a book include more than just reading, it is relaxing and you can forget troubles and sorrow for a moment and visit another world. It might be a world full with love and happiness and it do rub off, if just for a little while. Overall a book make you feel good. I believe that there can never be the same feeling and enchantment to read from a screen and push a button every time to turn page.
 Finally I want to say that you dive into a book in a way that you never can do with a pocket computer. You can never obtain the glorious feeling, of turning over to the last page of a book, and get the unravelling of the drama, that has taken place right in front of you, without the feeling of the actual book in your hands. A book radiate more than a computer ever can, but in a harmless (but overwhelming) way!",0
292,4041.a2.txt,Why we need students grants,"Being a student in Sweden means going through some hard financial years. The choice one makes though, does not only mean temporarily less income, but also a huge rate of the future income directly drawn to pay off the loans for years to come. This paper will deal with the problems connected to the issue. Firstly I will discuss the troublesome fact that a degree does not guarantee neither getting a job, nor an improved wage if one gets a job. Secondly I think that Sweden ought to show appreciation to those who are eager to learn, and realise how important it is to keep our intellectuality high. The third topic will be not risking people overworking themselves by having jobs and studies at the same time. I will sum up by presenting a possible solution to the following problem with people misusing the system if grants were to be introduced. 
I will start with what I hold as the most important reason of having students' grants. People who want money do best not going to the university at all. During the years of studies one has to cope with a lot less than what one could get at a low-paid job. Getting into the market after university studies, there is little difference in salary between jobs, which demand a degree and those not. Of course there are well-paid professions, but the overall difference is negligible compared with the situation in other countries. Including the loans, you end up at about the same level if you have a long education. This leaves us the reasonable conclusion that many of those studying, do it for pleasure and personal development, since the money profit is a joke. I do not imply that these are insufficient reasons, but I do feel that there ought to be some difference on the pay roll.
I also think it is important to show the awareness of the advantages of an educated nation. If Sweden wants to stay at the top of the world in economic and social domains, we need to keep up intellectually with the other industrial countries. I think this involves increasing the salaries too, but I will not get into that discussion here. Giving people a chance to get an education without ending up in a difficult situation financially, should make a significant difference in itself.
A risk that follows the economic disadvantage of being a student is the fact that many students both work and study at the same time. I can assert that it is rather tough to keep up in school, and in the acquiring of knowledge one does not have the time to become at all full-filled. I know that there are lots of students having problems grasping what they should in their education, and of course, having an income has to be the main issue.
As a last topic, I would like to come with a suggestion how to solve one of the greatest problems of having students' grants instead of loans; removing the risk of people taking advantage of the system. If there were no demands on the students, many people would probably just fool around studying a little bit of this and a little bit of that. To make this impossible, there could be loans from the beginning, that were to be written off when a student got a degree. There could be a certain amount of terms paid for, as there are today, so that it would be impossible to stay in the system forever. For those never reaching a degree, the loan would stay as a good reason not to give up. Today if you move abroad and do not pay tax in Sweden, they do not draw money to pay off your loan. I suggest the opposite; those who take their knowledge away from the country, would have to pay for their studies even if they have received a degree. Why should the state pay for something that is not of use to the country?
To sum up, I feel that Sweden would benefit in many areas by removing the only reason there is not to study: the loans. I think it is of great importance to keep developing your intellect to be able to develop psychologically. I therefore think Sweden would do best realising the need to show appreciation of those interested in getting an education by making the studies free with grants. To restrict the use of the grants, both to sift out the ones not serious in their studies and to reduce the expenses, I suggest that only those actually reaching a degree get the grants. To keep the country with what I reckon is one of the most aware people on earth, I think education has to be a central tool, available to everyone.",0
293,4042.a2.txt,Girls and boys in separate classes?,"During the last couple of years there have been discussions concerning separate classes for boys and girls in junior high school. This means that there would be one class for girls and one class for boys at each level. Despite this separation they will work according to the same curriculum and have the same subjects. Is this a good or a bad idea? Will this give them a true picture of what today's society look like? I believe that separate classes take away many important things from the students.
One of these things is different experiences and with that I mean different ways of looking at things. Boys and girls have various experiences due to the way they have been brought up and the way they have been treated by the people around them. Some children have good memories and some have bad memories but the thing is that the memories, or experiences, are not the same. 
Why is this so important then? Well, I believe that this divergence gives the lessons a bit of nuance. Boys and girls can contribute with their own views and thoughts, their own peculiarities. The teacher can use these differences during the lessons as examples or maybe as a good basis in a class discussion where the students learn that there are differences between boys and girls but they also learn that they are all equally important in the classroom and also in our society. 
For many years we have been striving for an equal society and we are on our way towards this goal. To join in on this journey you have to be able to co-operate with both males and females without any prejudice. Do you think this is possible if you have been attending a school in which boys and girls are separated thus taking away your chances to learn how to function in a situation which requires that kind of social competence? I would not think so. 
I think that a school like this teaches the students that it is right to separate girls from boys, that there are differences between the sexes in the way they learn things. Maybe the students get the idea that, for example, boys are better than girls, that this is the reason why they are separated. Thoughts like these would only take us back in time and not forward towards the equal society that we are working so hard to achieve. 
So why do some people advocate for this separation? They say that there are a lot of advantages with this kind of class. We all know that boys and girls are not the same. There is no point in denying that. The spokesman for this type of school says that the students are given more time to develop and find themselves. The boys do not have to ""show off"" in front of the girls. Instead they can put all of their time and effort into the schoolwork. The girls are also looked upon as winners in this system. They do not have to compete with the boys for the teacher's attention and they are given more room. 
What I have to say about the arguments for this kind of school is that I do not believe all of them. You develop into one person in the all-girls class and then, when you go out into the society, you have to change into another person who can work with both sexes. And who says that a little competition between boys and girls is bad? I believe that competition is necessary for everyone in order to turn them into strong human beings. 
If I were to give my opinion today on this question about separate classes for boys and girls at junior high school I would be against it. I feel that mixed classes have more to offer and teach students. They give them the opportunity to learn how to co-operate with people of the opposite sex. There is also a competition in the mixed classes that encourages students to develop and improve themselves and that is what school is all about, I believe.",0
294,4043.a2.txt,The Elderly Need the State,"When a person gets older it is important for him or her to have someone to rely on. About a hundred years ago it was rather obvious that the family should take care of the elderly. Today, however, the situation is completely different because in our society it is difficult for us to look after the elderly. So, we need help and this is where the state comes in. 
There are many reasons why a family cannot take care of the elderly. Firstly, most families have small children to look after and they need all the time and attention they can get from their parents. We all know that children can be very exhausting and demanding, which makes it impossible to concentrate on another person. If you are not fully dedicated to give the old people your help, it can end with disaster. Also, it can be even more difficult to take care of a person if he is handicapped and cannot manage by himself at all. It is a responsibility that few people can handle.
Secondly, most adults today need to work to make a living; therefore they cannot stay at home as often as they did before. Their work takes all of their time. Also, one thing that has changed radically if you look back in time is that some people have to travel a long time to their work. Maybe they have to work in a big city, or in another country. When they finally come home in the evenings they are often exhausted and need to rest. For an elderly person to ask for help can be difficult because he might feel that he is in the way. In such situations it is easy to start a quarrel, which can lead to anger between the family members. Such a relationship can be very stressful but above all not healthy. The elderly need someone who has time to spare. At an old people's home they often get the opportunity to relax, which means a lot to them. 
As mentioned before, it is a huge responsibility to take care of another human being. Imagine if something would happen. The elderly need special care, and you cannot offer that at home. It would be so much easier for you and them, but above all, safer if they stayed somewhere where help is close. 
The state can offer special care, which the elderly need so much. They have people who are educated and want to help the person that you love so much. Also, they have all the special equipment needed. Several old people's homes today can offer excellent medical care. It is something that they did not have a hundred years ago, and we should take advantage of that. There are so many people who care about the elderly and they can offer so much more. People can argue that families do not care about their elderly if they send them to a home with strangers. But it is actually the other way around. If you know in your heart that you cannot offer someone else your help, the best thing you can do is to let someone else step in. It is also important that the family tries to visit as often as they can because it means the world to old people. Regularly visits can actually improve the relationship between the elderly and the family. It is mentally hard for the elderly to know that they are dependent on someone else to survive because people do not want to rely on others. In other words, it is important to know that you can manage on your own, without causing concern for your family. We all need to feel independent in some way, both young and old. This is the way people work. To keep your head high and not give up are many people's philosophy today. 
All in all, elderly people need someone who can give them full attention, but most families today cannot do that. Therefore, it is not wrong to let the state take over. It is for the best, not only for you but for the elderly too.",0
295,4044.a2.txt,Should the family look after the elderly?,"It has been proposed that the family, and not the state, should look after the elderly. It seems like a natural thing to do when you first think about it. The children would grow up with their grandparents nearby and perhaps the understanding between old people and youths would improve. However, the society we live in today can not really be called natural and such heroic deeds do no longer fit in with people's lifestyles. It sounds to me just like a way for the state to save money and place a lot of extra work on the already overworked people and therefor I'm against it. 

The main reason why I don't agree with the proposition is that people in today's society have enough problems to worry about. Many men and women already feel overloaded with work, which includes both of them managing a full-time job, taking care of a home, a relationship and possibly of children. Apart from these chores, time has to be set aside for personal well-being in order to prevent collapses and other stress symptoms that are increasingly common these days. Therefore, I see no possibility in managing yet another task, especially one that demands a lot of work and responsibility.

Taking on the responsibility to care for one's elderly means that geographical mobility is out of the question, something that many people, including me, saw as an advantage when joining the European Union and a matter of personal freedom. Due to their task and their conscience, people would have to live their lives in the same geographical area as where they grew up. Let us look at an example: Ellen is a Swedish girl and an only child from a small village in the south of Sweden called N√§ttraby. She wants to become a French teacher and to improve her French she goes off to work in Paris for a year. While waiting tables in Paris she falls in love with Guillaume, a French cook. She decides to stay, marries Guillaume and they later have twins. When the children have reached the age of 10, her mother dies and her retired father has difficulties taking care of himself due to back problems. Since Ellen is the only family left and the family carries the responsibility to care for the elderly in Sweden, she feels obligated to return to N√§ttraby to look after her father. I strongly oppose the idea that Ellen or any other people would have to choose between their present family on one hand and the parents on the other, when there are state institutions with adequately educated staff to do so. 
 
If the state leaves it entirely up to families to look after their elders, what happens to the elders who don't have a family? Because of expenses of having children many women prefer to get a good education leading to a well-paying job first. This may mean they do not have children at all since there is not enough time to find a life partner and have babies before the menopause. Many women and men are also unable to have children due to physical or even mental reasons. Thus, there would have to be some sort of institution anyway to take care of the childless elders. Institutions for the elderly is something we can not live without in our modern and demanding society.",0
296,4045.a2.txt,What about Systembolaget?,"I thought it would only be fair to give my opinion on the much discussed topic of ""Systembolagets"" significance, both considering the issues of alcoholism and free enterprise. Since the discussion is so hot right now, it is in everyones interest, to speak their piece. So in the name of democracy I will give you my piece. 
Systembolaget is a great institution in Swedish culture, it has existed since somewhere around the 1950s and has always been trustworthy. I believe that keeping Systembolaget would be a favour to the Swedish nation, and to its inhabitants. 
First of all I'd like to point out that hardly anywhere in the world, one can purchase alcohol with such great variety of quality spirits, beer or/and wine, as one can in the Swedish Systembolaget. This is so, due to the fact that Systembolaget is a monopoly franchise with a lack of competition. The market is then friendly and withholds great variety. The prices, however, can be thought of as to excessive. I very much feel that it is the price one simply has to pay, if the high quality is to be maintained.
I understand people who don't agree with me, people who argues that alcohol should be sold in ordinary stores. It is a fine democratic thought. It wouldn't be better though. Think about it. Wouldn't liquor become a commodity like any other? I believe it would. And by becoming that impoverish the market so almost only standard brands would be available. The lesser quality alcohol would be more common and even cheaper, and the alcohol of higher quality would be noticeably more rare, and naturally a lot more expensive. That's not the way I like it. Look at Denmark there they have very few brands in their supermarkets. Cheap? Yes!, good? Not particularly, not at all in the same league as the Swedish Systembolagets.
If we move forward to the question of whether alcoholism would increase if we turned to an open market or if, in fact, there would be less problems caused by alcohol in a more open environment. I don't think things would change at all. Why would they? The core of the problem of alcoholism lies in the fact that alcohol exists. Also that it's been drunk for thousands of years. It has been in our culture as long as we can date it back. The only thing that could decrease the consumption of alcohol is if it was made illegal. But then again that would never happen, since such a large amount of tax-money comes from Swedens strict alcohol policy. The whole Swedish society would anyway protest such a motion and it would never win any political ground. 
If anything should be done about Systembolaget it is having it open on Saturdays. That is tried in chosen towns, but I think they should just keep it open in all towns. Otherwise Systembolaget is open Monday to Friday. People who don't like Systembolaget often uses that argument to make a point. The argument being, of course, you can not go there everyday, which restricts your individual rights, or something like that. I find that being a big heap of horse-manure, if you excuse the metaphor. Anyone with at least intelligence below average can plan the week so that time is set aside for the purchase of alcoholic beverages. 559
As a final subject there is the moonshine. Do people drink moonshine, well of course they do. Is that related to Systembolaget by any chance? In some aspects it is. However, I think that is the same as with the issue of alcoholism, it wouldn't really matter either way. Hearing me say that it wouldn't matter either way, may cause you to think ""then set it free, you have no argument"". Look then to my first argument and you will see that it is the only vital argument in this entire affair. The restaurants, night-clubs, pubs and such will still be there.
When you conclude this it's fairly easy to see where the common sense is. In this case of course, in the keeping of Systembolaget. Seeing it as an undemocratic institution can never be done with seriousness. With some planing you will have time to buy what you need during ordinary open-hours. Finally, the variety of flavours and brands will be uncompromised by the greed of, as the Americans say, the almighty dollar.",0
297,4048.a2.txt,THE IMPORTANCE OF SCHOOL GYMNASTICS,"In the last couple of years you might have heard a lot about school gymnastics, whether we should or should not have it as a compulsory subject on the schedule in the Swedish comprehensive schools. 

When the schools unfortunately have been forced to do severe cut-downs amongst teachers and classes (mostly by economic reasons), it seems like gymnastics has been one of the most frequent classes to be cancelled. Most people have argued for the importance of maintaining this subject in school, but still there has been a few people claiming that compulsory gym-classes are unnecessary and a waste of pupils time.

Today's living is far different from the way earlier generations have lived their life. Physic work were part of the ordinary day for them through labour and other daily occupations. Today it is not so, we live a far more lazy and convenient life and the food we eat contains about three times more fat than our ancestor's food did. As a result of this people have grown fatter and fatter through the years. Studies have shown that children in the ages of seven to twelve who do not have gymnastics at their timetable in school suffer a greater risk of being overweight when the are grownups, than children who do have gymnastics.

It is also important to remember that it is in the early years of living you lay the grounds for a good condition. And often also the basis for a great interest! Because it is supposed to be fun too! Many children find their future hobby during gym-class. In fact, a study amongst children in the ages of thirteen to eighteen a couple of years ago revealed that sports (school's gym-class included) made the pupils feel healthier both physical and psychological. The test revealed that the students that were active in some kind of sport, believed that without their hobby they would probably be more interested in 'bad things', such as smoking and drinking. The test also revealed that girls of this age rather would date someone who was active in some kind of sport than someone doing such 'bad things'.

As I said, schools have been forced to do rather big cut-downs, and people supporting cut-downs made in the gymnastics lessons in the schedule often claim that this is the least important part of the school system. Most of them feel that this physical part of the education is rather important, but also that it would be an even greater loss if we removed, for example, mathematics or biology from the schedule. Another argument is that in today's society you can find a local Gym almost anywhere, that parents should be responsible for their children visiting such places on a regular basis. (Like a school subject, but without any supervising teachers and no grades.) I think most parents will strike out this suggestion as soon as they have found out about the prices most these places have got.

It is a well known fact that a whole week of sitting still and studying can make anyone crazy. By Wednesday no one will have the strength of focusing and concentrating. The pupils performances in the ordinary school subjects will get worse and worse and of course the average grade will drop to a lower level. If there should be a government decision to solve this problem, that only some schools should keep gym-classes in their education, pupils in the schools without it, would suffer from it. Their final grades would probably be much lower than pupils from the schools with maintained gymnastics and they would have a much harder time competing into higher education.

I think we have got evidence enough that a removal of gymnastics classes from the compulsory schedule would be a great mistake, and that pupils would get affected by it in the long run. Therefore it is necessary to find alternative ways to solve this money problem. Maybe the compulsory schools should not be totally free anymore and there should be a small fee for every student. Or maybe it is up to the government to reconsider how they distribute the tax payers money...",0
298,5001.a2.txt,SWEDEN IS NOT YET A TRUE DEMOCRACY!,"Why do we still have a monarchy in Sweden? We claim that our country is democratic, that our country in fact is one of the most democratic countries in the world, but still we keep this antiquated institution - a royal family, set apart from the rest of the people, which creates an aberration in the Swedish democratic system. Monarchy should therefore no longer have a place in the Swedish society. 

True, the royal family has a strong support in our country. Many are those who rise to defend monarchy and the usefulness of having the royal family to represent our country, both as PR-ambassadors to other countries, as well as in internal ceremonies. They immediately point to the facts that monarchy has a long tradition in this country, and that the king and queen also fill a function as symbols for Sweden, which is very good for public relations with the outside world. They also mention that we are also one of the few remaining monarchies in the world, and thus very exotic for foreigners that visit us. The regent should furthermore not be seen as a threat to democracy, as he/she does not wield any true power, but merely fills a representative role. 
 
 It is true that the regent does not have any executive power any more, but still, the monarchic concept is not democratic, and therefore, Sweden is not a fully democratic nation. The opportunity to become regent and head of state is limited to a very few, and it is not likely that anyone outside the family of Bernadotte will ever fill the position as regent of Sweden. A more democratic Sweden would open the possibility to become head of state to a far greater number of its citizen than today's monarchy does.
 Monarchy is also undemocratic for the royal family. The heir to the throne has hardly any choice than to accept to reign, and has hardly any opportunity to live a normal life, without any attention from the media to everything that he or she does. 
 And is the royal family of Bernadotte truly traditional? They are not even of noble blood in the traditional sense of the word. They descend from a commoner whom formerly had the position of one of Napoleon's generals, and not from Gustav Vasa, the founder of the Swedish country, whom all other Swedish royalty descended from since his time. And Vasa was no mere warlord, but of a Swedish noble family, one of those from which the ranks of the chosen kings of Svea and Goetha realms were drawn for hundreds of years before the unification and liberation of Sweden, making his family's claim to the throne truly traditional.
 As for the aspect of the royal family's effect on public relations, and other's opinion of Sweden, what would be the result if something really scandalous happened within the royal family? What if the king was found to be a pederast, or if the princess Madeleine happened to stab somebody to death at a rave party? The name of the royal family would then be tainted, and I can well imagine what effect it would have on other countries' opinion and relations with us, if we continued to send our royal represents around the world after such events. 
 
Sweden needs another system of government, as it should be impossible for a country to be both monarchy and democracy, as these two are fundamentally different. A democracy should hold for everybody the opportunity to become head of state, and not hinder its citizens from the possibility to become what they want, no matter if they are royal family or not. Does not the position as, say, president fit this description much more than that of royal regent? Would it not be an good thing to one day see the daughter of a pizza cook become head of state, instead of the descendant of a general, whose father was a lawyer.",0
299,5002.a2.txt,"Subject: The family, not the state, should look after elderly. A social problem.","There have been a lot of discussions and debates for the last few years when it comes to question who are responsible of taking care of the elderly. Should it be the State or the family? It is a little bit complex because there is obviously a for and an against. Maybe the both sides are actually right but what I am going to do in my essay is to try to focus on these points and to analyse to see more clearly why the state should look after the elderly or on the contrary why the family has the responsibility of taking care of their parents when they grow older. 
In the first part I will focus on the state and see what it should be done to help making it easier for the elderly. Then in the second part I will concentrate on the family and the responsibility it has when it comes to looking after the elderly. Then in the third part, I will compare these two points and see if there is a way between these two cases to make the best for the elderly. Because the questions are: Is the family, nowadays ready to sacrifice their own life to their parents when they grow older? Does the state feel itself responsible for the elderly? There can be a kind of conflict between the family and the state when it has to deal with the elderly. But it has, of course to be assessed.
This subject dealing with the elderly is really a social problem nowadays, people are much more independent. Obviously it depends on what countries we are talking about. I think that the south countries in Europe are much more attached to their family and in this case I think that the families take much more care of their parents. They have this Family notion in their culture; their duty is to look after their parents when they are old even if themselves have a family to take care of, according to this culture, it is evidence. It can be different in countries like Sweden. Swedish people are more independent and that's the reason why the family thinks at first of itself than of their parents. But this is just a hypothesis; in my experience, I have seen that the state takes generally good care of the elderly here in Sweden. They get a lot of help to find people who take care of them even if they stay at home. The care centre here in Sweden hire people as nurses, and home-help service who help the elderly with everything from nursing to laundry, keeping them company and so on. I think that the state here in Sweden feels responsible for the elderly. They maybe pay more attention to them comparing to the south of Europe where there, the state maybe relies to much on the family because it knows that they have a culture like this, their duty is to have this responsibility.
Personally speaking, I think that we have to draw some limits when it comes to this subject. What I mean by that is that, I would and I will be ready to take care of my parents but as I say it has its limits. I think that I would be ready to take care of my parents if they became handicapped in some way. But I really do not know if I would be capable to have them in my home and if my parents would accept it either. It is easy to tell this when you do not have a family on your own. I really understand the persons who do not want to sacrifice their family because of their parents. But you can help them without taking the full responsibility for them; the state is present as well, to help the people in anyways. So in fact, there has to be a sort of cooperation between the family and the state. I think that the state has to help elderly in a practical way while the family has to be present to give love, consideration and support.
I think that everyone has a duty to perform in relation with their nearest. But I don't think that we have to sacrifice everything when a parent gets worse. They have lived their lives and I think that they really understand that. The children do not need, according to me, to do the nurse's job, the main thing and the most important is to be there with them even if they live in a retirement pension or someplace else. The state does generally a good job here in Sweden and it is very difficult to say if I am for or against the family to take care of the elderly because as I can see, the state and the family has to collaborate.",0
300,5003.a2.txt,Let kids try the game before they have to spell it!,"For the past few decades the importance of good education has increased considerably and lead to decisions such as letting six-year-olds or younger attend school. The sooner they learn how to read and write the better!?

That is most questionable, indicating the children's need to be children and not having to make faster progress or take greater responsibility than is actually necessary.

Being a child of six years or less, much time is devoted to explore the closest surroundings and adapt to a suiting role in the family. It's hardly fair to put them in school, forcing them to sit still for long periods and obey their teachers, who are too few in numbers and thus not able to prevent or end the, more oftenly, noisy and unpleasant environment. To some children this can be very distracting and they get very worked up missing out on individual progress, as persons, as well as on apprehending what's taught in class.

The actual knowledge achieved in class can also be discussed. Authorities want a complete curriculum with Swedish, Mathematics, Science, History and even English! Despite lack of literacy in Swedish they are meant to learn English. (Making sure they are familiar with the language, so a third language can be introduced as soon as possible.)

This easily creates greater gaps between gifted and non-gifted children, which is already an extensive problem. For both groups the higher demands are often connected to more responsibility which at this age are simply too much to ask for. Self-criticism, low self-esteem, loss of faith and apathy towards education, are common effects on this, unfortunate aim for great progress. 

Thus, accounts must be taken for mental effects as well. So far it has all been focused on the educative aspects, but the children's ability to adapt socially, can by no means be left out.

To start with, leaving the safety of the home can be very bewildering, as being away from the parents, who has been their only fixed point in life, so far. Put in school they're thrust into a miniature society with fix rules, expectations and set models. They are deprived their own chance to experience and explore this fascinating life itself.

If they're given the possibility to spend more time at home with their parents, that would create a more harmonic and natural environment for all parts, the parents indulged in a well-needed brake from the hectic working life, as an example.

A last aspect to this is the financial aspect, which is profitable as well, since expenses for education; teachers, materials, food, buses, will decrease and the individual family could profit from lower taxes, and possibly smaller amounts on fashionable clothes, contributions to school trips and other activities.

This part might be contradicted by many, since a lot of people probably think there'll be a loss of income if the parents spend more time at home with their children, instead of working, but with active planning of ones' work that can be prevented.

The opinion, of many opponents, that not attending to school and having too much freetime and lack of settled daily routine would invite them to adopt bad habits, can only be defended by the fact that the parents are present and regulate these factors.

Knowing, most of us want the best for the children and their future it is quite clear that school attendance should not be commenced by the age of six or earlier. They would become more harmonic, distressed and happy if they could spend more time in their home environment together with neighbourhood friends and parents. Life is precious and should not be wasted or hasten through. Make it possible for kids to see what life is really all about, before it has passed them by.",0
301,5004.a2.txt,"Please, show more about the starvation on the television!","For about two weeks the television and the newspaper have had the terror attack against the US as their biggest news. You can't turn the television on without hearing about where bin Laden is hiding, how the US is going to find him and if the US is going to declare a war against the terror. It was almost 7000 people who died in the terror attack and everybody feels sorry for them. At the same time, 30000 children are starving to death, every day. There is absolutely no defence for what the terrorists did to the US, but it is time that we think about other problems. If you feel sorry for the relatives and friends to them who died in World Trade Centre and Pentagon, think about the persons in for example Buenos Aires, who has to go through a lost of a child maybe not only once, but twice. It is time that we fight against the really big problem; it is time that we fight against the starvation.

In short, there is absolutely nothing you or I can do alone, to stop the malnutrition in the whole world. The hunger makes the children defenceless against every bacterium. But together we can give the children a better start of their lives, but people tend to forget about all the starving children in other countries. All we think of right now is the terror attack in the US. Things that are not shown on television we don't find as real. The starving children are just something we hear about, but we cant really imagine how it is like in the poorest countries.

Therefore I think that all the countries that support the US should think twice on what they are spending their money on. If there are going to be a war, several innocent people will have to offer their lives. And what if this war against the terror turn out to be something much bigger, World War Three, for example. Do we want to offer innocent lives in a war against the terror, or is it better to try to save innocent life in the war against starvation? The children do not need much money at all to survive and I think that it is better to spend the millions this war will cost, to save these innocent children's life.

All of you that send money to the victims of the terror in the US please don't. Or do at least send half of them to the poor countries fight against the starvation. If you are sending your money to the US you are helping them to build some new buildings. If you are sending them to children in need, you might save lives. We have to think about what the most important thing is: that New York will look the same as it did before, or if it is more important to save lives. My opinion is that there is nothing that could be more important than to save children's life, because they are our future. World Trade Centre was just a building.

As I mentioned before, there is absolutely no defence for the terror attack against the United States in New York and Washington. But it could be an idea to think about that they that killed them and thousands of other people knew that this was going to be showed on the television. The murders knew one thing. This is going to be good televisions for several weeks.

The ones who are starving to death are not thinking about the television. They are thinking about how they are going to find food to survive. After some they give up and die.

Finally I would like to say that it would be good if the media could focus more on the starvation that continues in the poorest countries every day. As it is today, the starvation is set aside. The one who think that it is not real because it is not showed on the television need to think about what power the television has over our mind.",0
302,5005.a2.txt,CHANGE THE AGE LIMIT FOR BUYING ALCOHOL,"Have you ever thought about, just like I have, why we in Sweden have the odd legislation that people are allowed to buy alcohol in a bar the day they are 18 years old but they have to wait until they are 20 to go to ""Systembolaget""? it is very difficult for me to see the reasons why there should not be a change in the law in order to let people from the age of 18 buy alcohol at ""Systembolaget"".

To obtain alcohol is not a problem when you are 18 years old. Almost everyone knows someone who is 20 and, even though it is unlawful to peddle liquor, it is not seen as a big crime if the one you peddle to is over the age of 18. Many of my friends had parents who acted like peddlers after the day their sons and daughters were 18 years old, some of them even before that. The parents did this because they in this way thought they had control over how much their children drank. I also think they tried to tell their children that they trusted them and show them that they, in the eyes of the parents, had came a piece of the way to the life as an adult.

Another reason for parents buying alcohol to their children is the fear of illicitly distilled liquor. This is another motive for me to say that the age limit for buying alcohol at ""Systembolaget"" should be lowered. It is easy to get hold of home distilled liquor and if the youths can not obtain alcohol from ""Systembolaget"", which most of them prefer even though it is more expensive, they turn to the dangerous illicitly distilled liquor.

I return to what I mentioned in the beginning of the essay; that people in the ages between 18 and 20 are permitted to go to a bar and have a drink, but are not allowed to go to the state liquor shop to buy a few beers. I think the main reason to why we have not already got a change in the law is the fear that youths will easier be able to obtain alcohol if the age limit would be lower. This might be true, to get alcohol is already quite easy for many youths. Nevertheless, I do not think a change in the law would make any major differences in the possibilities for the young people to obtain alcohol. Furthermore I do not think that youths will drink more than they do today.

Look at France and Great Britain, for example. The age limit for buying alcohol is lower there than in Sweden, but young people do not drink more because of that. Can the reason be that a part of the excitement is taken away when it is legal? In Sweden, the youths tend to take every given possibility to get drunk, partly because it is unlawful.
According to one of my friends who just came back from one year as an au pair in the United States is the situation much worse there than here in Sweden. In most states, it is illegal to drink alcohol before you are 21 years old, but many people drink before that age anyway. She says that the sad thing in the United States is that the youths are not sufficiently informed about the dangers that follows alcohol consumption. There are not many countries with so many car accidents involving drunk drivers as there are in the United States. 

Whereas the opposition argues that the reason for having different age limits in bars and at ""Systembolaget"" is that the consumption is under control when you are in a bar, the people who want a change in the law maintain that this is not the case. I have asked a few friends and they, just like me, had to admit that you rarely notice a bartender or a guard telling a guest not to drink more because he or she is too drunk. 

Not only would an age limit lowering for buying alcohol at ""Systembolaget"" make things easier for the young people between age 18 and 20, it would also make much more sense. I think we have to face the fact that young people will always drink, in Sweden as well as in other countries, even if we legislate against it or not. More information about the dangers may help, but I think that a part of the fun with drinking when you are young is that it is illegal...",0
303,5006.a2.txt,EU- The new Sovjet-union,"Intruduction
All since Sweden joined the EU, there have been political discussions whether it is good for the country or not. What have we benefited from the membership and is it worth all the money that has been invested. Many people are disappointed and do not think the membership corresponds to all the promises that were connected with the membership. There have also occurred different problems connected to the EU- meetings like demonstrations and violence, that was not expected in advance.

The bureaucracy
The EU parliament is a huge machine and costs a large amount of money to run. There are salaries for all the politicians involved and allowance for expenses but also expenses for travelling. The bureaucracy is a big problem. To have an influence in the EU is very hard, because it is a very large political body. The system works so that large countries get greater influence than smaller countries. In reality it means that small countries have very little influence and can be voted down on in many issues. It is hard for a small country to raise a question because it is difficult to get enough support. It is also difficult for an individual to have an influence either on politicians, or to raise an issue through legal channel. There are many EU politicians at many different levels such as commissioners ministers or parliamentarian. Some of them have been found to be corrupted in meaning to take advantages, or benefit on behalf of their position. There are examples of incorrect wages and wrong employments or other examples of unsuitable behaviour.

EU-regulations
In Sweden, we have come far ahead of many European countries in issues concerning pollution, the environment, the prevention of cruelty to animals, job equality and other questions of big importance. But it is difficult to make laws that are applicable for every single country. Furthermore many regulations or directives are simply not adaptable to specific countries. To EU adapt whole society costs a large amount of money and does more harm than good in many cases. The food industry have many directives and standards to adjust to, and it affect Swedish food so that it becomes less healthy. Local Swedish agriculture gets competition from abroad and less subsidies from the state, with the free trade agreement. This affects most of all animals, because it is impossible to provide good care of animals when the prices are pressed down to minimum.

Criminality
According to the free mobility for inhabitants between EU countries, a new market has been created for criminality. Illicit traffic flourishes nearly uncontrollably with big networks of criminal gangs involved. They are often run from abroad where they are hard to control. This problem affects society in a very negative way and it includes large costs both from a human perspective and in economic terms. Violence in connection with major EU meetings has become a big problem. It brings insecurity to the citizens and causes substantial materiel damage.

Summary
 Western Europe consists of sharply demarcated territories and they form strong and self-supporting nations with strong identities, so there is no need to form a union with already strong units. EU only seems to create more problems than advantages. A better solution to global problems would be to form smaller geographical units of cooperation. With nations which are naturally demarcated to the same area, and often have to deal with similar kind of issues. One example could be the Scandinavian countries. And then small countries would be stronger and have greater chance to influence conditions in different issues. In this report, I have tried to focus on some major problems that occur when a political union becomes a political centre.",0
304,5007.a2.txt,THE CARE FOR THE ELDERLY IS THE STATES RESPONSIBILITY,"Introduction:The question about how the elderly in our society should be taken care of is important. I have thought a lot about this and come to a conclusion that it is the states responsibility to take care of the elderly. 

If you compare our modern society today with what it was like 100 years ago, when most people were farmers and worked in, or near the home, it was natural that the elderly lived together with the family and could be taken care of in the home. Today people work or go to school away from the home, to make a living and it would be impossible to nurse an old person at home.

It is expensive and most familys can not afford the care for their olderrelatives. It can all so be difficult to nurse an old person if she or he have disabilities, suffer from an illness, like for example alzheimers disease or any other difficult medical illness that need special treatment in a hospital or by nursing staff. 

Another important thing is the nursinghomes, which in my oppinionoffers a high quality of care, even though exeptions exists. I think thestate must give more money to education for care of elderly as well as to the nursing homes. That will lead to higher salarys, more educatedworkers, a larger staff, because more people are incouraged to work inthe old-age care and that will in the end lead to better care. 

Some elderly wish to be nursed and want to live at home untill they die. This issue should be supported by the state and a possibility for those who wishes. There are elderly that does not have any relatives and they are in greater need of the state. 

There are however people that do not trust the state, because of the cases of mismanagement of elderly that the media brought up.Because of that, the state must concentrate and examine the carebetter. 

Conclution:It is the states responsibility to see to the elderlys need and supportthe familys in ur society which might want to take care of their elderlybut are unabel to do so.",0
305,5008.a2.txt,"University students should be given grants, not loans, to finance their studies.","Today employers ask for educated people to join their staff. Sometimes they have difficulties to find the persons they want, because there are not enough skilled workers in many areas. At the same time universities and high schools have trouble to get students to the courses they arrange. I am convinced that a main reason for many young people not to study is that the students have to finance their studies mainly by loans. Therefore, I would like to suggest higher grants instead of loans.
  The salaries for educated people are not very high in comparison to a usual worker. Everyone who has taken study loans have to pay them back. At first the tax must be paid and then the loan. This is of course much more expensive than the other way around. The result is that the educated person has less money left than the worker after taxes and study debts are paid. This situation does not encourage anyone to go to higher education. The future prospects of getting an interesting labour after academic studies are of course better, but young people sometimes do not realize that. Some are also frightened of being in debt for many years, so they choose to begin to work very early in life.
Of course, to give grants to the students would cost much for the state. On the other hand in the long run the salaries can be kept on a somewhat lower level. Swedish products and services would be more competitive on the international market. Another effect of lower salaries is that the inflation would be kept at a lower rate. Education is for a society a good investment. If entrepreneurs can find qualified workers, they have better possibilities to expand. Another effect is that it also would be easier to compare salaries between different working categories. 
Today there is a small grant given to the students. I would argue that it should be at the same level as public assistence plus a sum for the course literature. This would not give the students a very comfortable life. For expensive leisure activities they would have to come up on their own. I would propose that they worked for some hours a week. That would be a good break in the routine. Studies might be monotonous and tedious and another activity may help. The situation would be different from today, when many students work a lot because they do not want to have the burden of loans later on in life. This has a very bad influence on their study results. With grants the students would be capable of finishing their studies in due time. This is good for the students, but also for the society. The studnets would become employed and the places at university open for new students. 
I would prefer a system with a different grant for the students who managed to get 15 points the previous term and a higher one for the students with 20 points. In connection to this there must as well be a social security system for the students if they become ill or cannot continue their studies for other reasons. Some people would argue, that studies paid by grant would have as a result that too many would like to study. On the other hand, if the labour market does not need more people in a field, the universities and high schools would not be given the money from the state to provide further study places. If the demand for studies will grow the institutions will have the possibility to choose the student with the best merits.
To sum up I see a lot of advantages in studies mainly financed by grants. The society will gain on it through a more well-educated population, less unemployment, lower inflation and a more competitive market. The students would not be forced to live with debts, the study time will become shorter and more relaxed.",0
306,5010.a2.txt,Should the US bomb Afghanistan?,"The historical events that took place at the World Trade Centre in New York and in Pentagon only a week ago are still very hard to grasp. Now feelings of hatred and anger are spreading through the democratic world, especially in the US. Many want revenge and retaliation and the guilty to be punished. The US really seems to be preparing for war and seemingly the majority of the people in the country are in favour, though attacking Afghanistan may show to be a huge risk. People are in anger and many think that what happened on September eleven is like a declaration of war on the US. It is comparable to the attack on Pearl Harbour that led the Americans to go to war in 1940. This time the free world is not facing an ordinary enemy, though. The enemy this time is not as well defined and is not only a specific country.
First of all we have to question whether the US has enough proof to be able to attack Afghanistan. The US has declared war against all terrorism. This includes everyone involved in terrorism and every country that either supports or protects terrorists. Right now the main goals are Usama Bin Laden and the Taliban regime. We have to realise that the US forces are out to fight a limited number of devoted enemies. It is not like they are at war with the entire nation of Afghanistan. The US are on the hunt for the terrorist Usama bin Laden and his followers, presuming he is quilty of the terror attacks, even though no proof of him being responsible has actually been shown clearly to the world. They don't even know whether he is actually in Afghanistan or not, all though most facts points to that he is. The US has also declared war against the Taliban regime because they are not willing to hand out Usama bin Laden and his followers. The Taliban regime refuses to do that because the US hasn't given any proof that his organisation is actually responsible. The US needs more proof!
We also have to consider the fact that an attack doesn't assure that the US troops will be able to catch Usama Bin Laden. If the US attacks Afghanistan it will probably cause the death of a huge amount of innocent people, people who oppose terrorism and who oppose the Taliban regime will die. This will lead to even more hatred against the US. People related to victims will always relate the US with killing their innocent relatives and will feel hatred towards them, which itself will create new terrorists and fanatics with the US as the main target. It will also lead to even more hatred among people who already oppose the US. In the political and religious environment that Afghanistan represent, major attacks will only give terrorists and fanatics such as Usama Bin Laden even more reasons to attack the US. 
Right now the American nation demands that the rest of the world supports them in their fight against terrorism. This also puts pressure on the USA. The American government can't expect the rest of the world to support their fight against terrorism if they do it by killing innocent people. It would be better to show the world that the US really wants a solution to the Palestine problem instead of, like up to now, basically only support the Israeli side.
The US should realise that fighting terrorism is not only about military action. It will demand politic changes which goals should be peace in the Middle East and other critic areas. Money should be spent on economical development instead of military aid. The US should also be more willing to cooperate with the United Nations, which is something the US has tended not to in the past.
The eighteen suicide Muslims in the attacks of September eleven were probably not stupid guys, they were probably intelligent, devoted and highly motivated after own experiences of violence to their own families, relatives and nations. It is most likely that these eighteen persons were not the only ones planning this attack but only ""the point of the sword"". There are probably more of the likes to perform more terrorist attacks in the future if the US retaliates blindly and in anger. There is probably also a lot of money in the Muslim world willing to back up such terrorist actions in the future if the Muslim world is bombed.
The thing to do instead, to keep the sympathy up for the US cause, would rather be to isolate the terrorists politically, like NATO and England now for the first time in 20 years are doing, negotiating with the former enemy Iran, who's politics only a few years ago regarded the US and Nato as Satan. The other thing of course would be to seriously put pressure on Israel to produce a solution to the Palestine problem that will also be regarded as a reasonable and honourable solution to the Palestine nation.
Otherwise there will be more terrorist attacks all over the world in the future. Violence will undoubtedly produce more violence.
Since a military action against Afghanistan most certainly will create only more hate against the US in the Muslim world, bombing Afghanistan will only result in more terrorist attacks in the future. Therefore the solution to the Taliban problem and Usama bin Laden is not a military one but a political one.",0
307,5011.a2.txt,"Is it necessary to have a monarchy in Sweden? Do we need the King, the Queen and the whole Royal family? Isn't it hopelessly old-fashioned to inherit a title and an occupation like the kings and the queens do and doesn't all that belong to the past? It is rather easy to answer yes to these questions and to find counter arguments for the monarchy but nevertheless I'm definitely for it.","Sweden got to have a ceremonial head of state who can represent the country outside Sweden. I think the royal couple is doing a great job and I don't think that a president or a prime minister is better suited for the task. The King and the Queen of Sweden are well educated and well prepared for their duties and furthermore they are very devoted and they are surely doing the best they can for Sweden when it comes to public relations. The Queen is also involved in different charity work. They are creating a lot of goodwill for Sweden throughout the world. They also serve for life, which is good under the circumstances. I mean, Sweden is a small country and I think it's important that our royal couple is well known. It's easier to become well known if you serve for life than if you are elected for a period of four years like the prime minister in Sweden. Another important thing is that the monarch has no political power, as I think it is in all the kingdoms in Europe. The monarchs have to be politically neutral.
A counter argument often heard is that the monarchy costs a lot of money but I'm sure that a president and all the other persons it would be necessary to appoint or elect to do the work that the Royal family does now, will cost just as much. The financial situation for the taxpayers would not change if we had a presidency instead of a monarchy, at least the tax wouldn't be reduced.
Another reason to keep the monarchy is that the citizens of Sweden still want them. A great majority of the Swedish people is for the monarchy and the royal family is extremely popular. Polls reveal that the royal family rates very high in people's esteem. Many people follow every step they take by reading magazines and watching television programmes. Their interest in the royal family is a great source of amusement for them. I can imagine that instead of reading fairy-tales or fantasy books some of them follow the princes and princesses in all they are doing, and the love affairs, of course, is the most interesting. This curiosity that people have for their private lives must be rather annoying. To be constantly followed by journalists, photographers and other media people must be utterly embarrassing and make them angry, even furious at times. In Sweden I don't think the mass media is as offensive as one has heard of elsewhere. They do respect the privacy of the royal family to a certain point. We haven't heard so much of the paparazzi in Sweden like we heard when Lady Di had her accident and so unfortunately passed away. I think it is unethical to chase royalties and other famous people just to find scandalous things to publish. In Sweden the magazines and the evening papers go beyond the limit sometimes, but the situation is not so bad, at least not yet.
If we were to choose between a presidency and a monarchy today and we had had neither of the two I would certainly choose a presidency but actually we have a monarchy and there is no reason to get rid of it. We have it since several centuries and the Bernadotte family for many generations. They are doing a great job. As long as they obtain such popularity and do their part for the best of Sweden I see no reason to put them aside. I also consider the fact, that the monarch lost political power a long time ago and has no longer any influence in politics at all, very important. I'm totally convinced that at the moment, we have nothing to win by changing the monarchy into a presidency.",0
308,5012.a2.txt,A healthier approach to life,"Todays food industry is big business with large profits to gain. The variety is vast, to the point were consumers get lost and often buy products that they have no need for. TV bombards us with the repeated message that our lives will become so much easier once we purchase their products. Most people give in to commercial pressure, unaware of the manipulation and still they are left unsatisfied. Health is on a decline and most of us are plagued by an inherent sense of lack of direction. There are however some signs of awakening. People are looking for alternatives but many still feel they have no good choices as they have little knowledge of other diets and life stiles. Here I would like to present them with a good alternative, namely the vegetarian diet.
Young people base their choice to become vegetarians on moral/ethical grounds. They are presently joining ranks in the animal rights movement, much as a reaction to gruesome and deeply disturbing footage of animal mismanagement. To them, vegetarianism is a way to show their disgust at the way the industry treats animals. The meat industry, like all other enterprise, is powered by greed. With profit in mind, live stock are stripped of all their dignity. I would like to point out that consumers need to take responsibility too as they demand high quality product for the lowest possible price. Industry complies and one of the consequences we have witnessed is the transportation of livestock in overcrowded trucks moving across the European continent. This type of unnatural experience produces stress reactions in livestock, severely injuring them and even causing deaths.
A similar disrespect for natures ways may be observed in the poultry industry. In a zealous attempt to improve profit-margins, poultry are fed growth hormones and antibiotics. Subsequently their muscle mass increases at a rate far faster then nature designed. Some of us have seen footage of chickens weighing three times their natural weight and as a result their bones literally crack under the pressure. Beef and milking cows are also fed antibiotic and steroid hormones, added to prevent infection and increase weight quickly. These medications are then passed on to the consumer and are in turn associated with a decreased responsiveness to antibiotic therapy in human patients.
The problem with meat today, then, is perhaps not that it is meat, but that it is adulterated meat, from sick and over medicated animals. What amounts to the worst case of blatant disrespect to natures ways, is the repulsive practice of feeding pulverised carcasses to cattle. Today we have to live with the terrible repercussions of this questionable practice. This leads me to the second reason for opting for a vegetarian diet namely the health benefits. By restraining from eating meat one eliminate the risk of contracting BSE. However, it is said that the risks are minimal. Saturated fats and cholesterol, on the other hand, do scare people and animal products contain a high level of both. Medical research have shown the strong links between high consumption of meats and arteriosclerosis and even some types of cancer. Charcoal grilled steaks are indeed classified as highly carcinogenic.
Obesity is yet another symptom of high intake of saturated fats. It has become so prevalent that even children are victims. Institutions such as the US summer camps have had to include courses where children receive help to break their destructive eating habits. There are of course other factors that contribute to obesity such as the relatively recent introduction of fast foods, sodas and mass availability of junk food. However, I would strongly suggest that a conscious decision to follow a well balanced vegetarian diet would not only keep weight at check but most certainly improve the general state of health. A word of caution is called for here. Vegetable and grain crops are increasingly being irradiated and pesticides and fertilisers are still used in large amounts. Therefore it is important to buy ecologically grown produce whenever possible. This will give us a product with a higher vitamin and mineral content and as an added benefit one will have helped to protect the environment. 
With an increased energy level, resulting from a reduced burden on the digestive system, vegetarians frequently find a subtle shift in consciousness. Some leave it at that, whilst others may investigate further and find they have become more in tune with their intuition. For this reason, many religions advocate a diet void of animal products. The vegetarian Hindus are one of them and so are the Buddhists. Even some philosophers have found an enhanced sensibility and increased mental power as a result of eating mostly vegetables and grains. Indeed two such prominent philosophers as Plato and Pythagoras were both vegetarians. The spiritual aspect is a strong incentive but has yet to influence the main population.
I have offered a choice and mentioned reasons that will lead you on the road to improved health and increased awareness. My definition of a good human is one that takes positive steps to incorporated love and compassion in every aspect of their life. I sincerely hope no one embarks on vegetarian diet simply to become slim, or to be politically correct. Indeed those who are capable of unconditional love at all times are forever healthy.",0
309,5013.a2.txt,MORE WOMENSOCCER IN MEDIA!,"""Well, this was a lot of fun - to be on national television that is"". That was what Tina Nordlund said on TV when she received the ""Diamondball"" for being the best swedish female soccerplayer, at the Swedish Soccerawards last fall. The truth in these words can hardly be mistaken, especially since they were said at an socceraward where two of the awardwinners were women while seven or eight were men. How many then knew who Tina Nordlund was? Compare that number of people with the number of those who do not know who Magnus Hedman is, who got awarded for being the best male soccerplayer. You really have to look for womensoccer and you hardly hear or see it mentioned anywhere. This strongly shows that womensoccer needs more space in media!

Equality is something that is very highly valuated in the society of today and theissue develops all the time. Women have the same rights, they are almost getting paid as much to do a job as their male collegues. This is why there should be equality in the media too - at least some kind of it anyway. Women have the rights to vote, to have careers and well-paid jobs, but not to forget talent, soccershoes and shinpads - just like men do.Women have managed to deal with their voting-right, their careers and well-paid jobs good - just like men do. Give the women a chance to use their talents out on the soccerfield and give us a chance to find out about it! Womensoccer needs more room in media!

The argument against having more womensoccer in media is usually that people are not interested in womensoccer. That is why expensive space in media is not used for things that does not sell. Fine, there is a point there; people are not interested because they hardly know it exists. With more womensoccer in media the interest would increase and in the same time be a much bigger issue for media to deal with. More spectators and more sponsors will make more people willing to invest in it, which makes the whole thing better and more interesting both for senders and receivers. We have to get the ball rolling, literary speaking.

You can read about trotting in the sportpages. But honestly, how many people are really interested in trotting? Obviously some, but far from everyone. Nobody can demand that everyone should like everything. That is impossible.

The swedish women soccerteam is actually quite good. Thinking about the fact that they came on third place in the Summer Olympic's '96 and they lost the European championship-final last summer. That is pretty impressive. Though I wonder how many people that actually know about that. Media does not seem to care much about it, but try to find someone who does not know that the swedish male soccerteam came third in the World championship the summer of '94 in the U.S. Maybe you will find a few. When we have a good women soccerteam like this, why not show it?!

We need more equality in the soccermedia! Let the women show us what they can do, we owe them that chance! Swedish malesoccer has been focused on in media for a long period of time. The society is developing, don't you think it is time to invest in the women now?MORE WOMENSOCCER IN MEDIA!",0
310,5014.a2.txt,Down with the King,"I claim the king together with the entire royal family do not belong in a democratic country as Sweden. Ever since almost anyone can remember we have had a king who in... some sense has governed Sweden. But times have changed. It is with no hesitation that I argue for Sweden to leave our monarchy influenced constitution and there will be no doubt you will agree with me after reading this essay. 
The king of Sweden does not posses any real power in that way he can make decisions on national or even local levels. The country of Sweden, so to say, employs him. On the surface you can easily believe he is just a face out towards the people of Sweden and other countries, holding speeches and cutting band at opening ceremonies. The powers possessed by the king are not that obvious. Our king possesses power. In fact he is one of Sweden's most influent opinion-makers. As a king he gets lots of attention from media, which makes him very powerful. The power he possesses is, without any doubts, due to the fact that he is king, a position that he has inherited. No matter if he likes it or not he influences the people a lot with his actions and statements; he is a powerful leader of peoples minds. The question is if whether a democratic country like Sweden can have a strong opinion-maker that inherit his power. It is with my biggest convention that I maintain that that this is totally against all thinking in a democratic country. It makes me feel ill at ease when I think of power that is inherited, and of course that cannot be acceptable. Just to emphasise this main and very crucial point, a hereditary position that entails great power over the people does not belong in a democratic country. We must never forget the importance of that, thus we cannot have a king who inherit his position.
Of course there might be some people that do not see the issue. Some may say ""-Yeah, yeah. He might influence the opinion, but I like him though. He is nice."" The king is popular, especially amongst the elderly in our society. The king is a down-to-earth person with simple hobbies that many of the elderly can identify with. Hence it might be hard to see why anybody would have a problem with this harmless fellow. So let me give an example why I am concerned with the way he influences the thinking of people's minds. One of his hobbies is to hunt. Every year he goes hunting elk. I am one of those people who do not eat meat because I do not consider us humans to have any right to eat other animals. Every now and then we follow the king broadcasted on television, out hunting elk with his ever happy and smiling hunting friends. This portrait of the king and his habits strengthen the right to act in a manner, which I consider awkward. To hunt down and kill animals righteous many peoples habits of eating meat and killing animals. There is no way I just can sit back and watch this man, the man who should represent the whole country, without reacting. I do not want that man to represent Sweden, but there is nothing I can do about it. This argumentation essay is not about issues concerning eating meat or not, nonetheless I think I have maid my point clear. A man employed by the country of Sweden ought to express the opinions of the majority and hence has to be elected by the people. With this not said we would have someone we would all like, but that is the way it has to work in a democratic country. 
So to conclude my standpoint I have to say there can be no place for inherited monarchy in a democratic country like Sweden. A man in this position has to represent the people. It is not acceptable that a man possessing power as a direct cause by the fact that he is employed by the country of Sweden is not elected by us all.",0
311,5016.a2.txt,Allow homosexuals to adopt children,"Homosexuals in Sweden can not adopt children. It does not matter how loving they are or how much the child needs them; the law does not give couples of the same sex the right to adopt children. This must be changed.
The main reason I have for making this statement is that if you do not give homosexuals the same rights as heterosexuals it is discrimination and discrimination of any kind are against the law. Everyone should have the same rights to adopt a child; if you are gay or straight has nothing to do with your capacity to be a good parent.
Moreover it should be said that adopting a child is nothing you do over night, not even if you are a heterosexual. The process of adopting a child is long, you and your partner will be studied to see if you are suitable for becoming parents and you will not be approved if you have not thought your decision to adopt trough. Adoptive parents have planned and prepared a long time for their child, they will love and care for it, no matter if they are heterosexual or not. 
Adoption, and the close study of you and your partner that comes with it, is for most homosexual couples the only way to get a child. Compare this with the fact that a lot of children today are brought up by parents who do not love them, who abuse them and who, in other ways, do not give their them what they need. In addition to this there are children all over the world that do not have a home, who are raised in orpanhages or in other terrible conditions. What would not these children do for a chance to be a part of a loving family, gay or straight. By not allowing homosexuals to adopt we let our prejudice get in the way of the welfare of the children. This is not the way it should be, and I think you all agree with me when I say that it is better for a child to grow up with homosexual, loving parents than to starve to death.
One thing that many people uses as an argument against homosexual adoptions is that the children being brought up in an environment like this runs a greater risk to be teased and harassed than children that are being adopted by heterosexual parents. In today's society that may be true, but we can not overcome the prejudices if we bend for them. Racism is a problem in Sweden, like in many other countries, but that do not stop us from adopting black children even though there is a risk that they could be victims of racism. We can not let the prejudices stop us from doing what is right.
Another argument that is sometimes given by people who do not want homosexuals to have the right to adopt is that a child needs both a male and a female role model in its life. This may also be right, but it does not have to be the parents playing this role. Far from all children today grows up with both a father and a mother, but that does not mean they do not have someone from both sexes to look up to. Role models in today's society can be grandparents, neighbors, teachers or anyone else that the child might have good contact with.
Finally I would just like to say that even if we can not stop inappropriate individuals, such as drug addicts, from having children, we can, and we should, stop the discrimination of the homosexuals and give them the same right as the heterosexuals to adopt children.",0
312,5017.a2.txt,Fruit is evil,"As we all know, bad health is one of the greatest threats to the wealth of the western world. Overweight, sickness associated with too high cholesterol values, constant tiredness and exhaustion are well-known problems most commonly caused by inappropriate manners in eating. Many blame fast food and lack of descent cooking for this, but I'd like to point out another, much worse felon: fruit. Most people claim that this is an essential part of a nutritious diet, but I will prove such is not the case. 15 months ago, I deliberately ceased to eat all kinds of raw fruit. The result: I feel great.
I do agree that fruits contain many vitamins that are necessary for physical well-being, but these could easily be found elsewhere (in vegetables and pills for instance; the latter is by the way a very rational source, since a pill a day is all you need to swallow). What made me an opponent to fruit eating, however, was a profound consideration of certain human aspects. Almost all fruit consumed here is grown in gigantic plantations, in many ways similar to Nazi concentration camps. Bananas and oranges are forced to grow up in a totally unnatural environment, where intoxication of both themselves and the people collecting them is common due to the implementation of chemicals. After reaching desirable sizes, the fruits are transported in such great misery it makes the shipping of slaves in the 1700s look almost luxurious. Apart from being intoxicated, plantation workers suffer seriously because of hazardous wages, working and living conditions. One might wonder whether those working at the plantations really have a choice. At the moment, I'm afraid they don't, since the countries they live in are mostly poorly developed ones. 
The underdevelopment of fruit producing countries is of utmost interest. May it not be that these countries are poor because they grow fruit? You might think that this isn't a realistic thought, but I dare say, it is surely a thrilling one. Of course, all exporters of fruit aren't poor. New Zealand and Israel, for instance, are wealthy nations that sell a considerable amount of oranges and apples. I reckon this has two major reasons: most importantly, there are a lot of foreign workers here, who don't think getting well paid is a prerequisite (that probably goes for the typical Kibbutz worker). Furthermore, wealthy fruit-growers were already in possession of a highly developed infrastructure before they started exporting the controversial goods. Poor exporters have hardly got anything one could call infrastructure, and therefor get locked into a pattern. In order to break that pattern the country needs new industries, something that often requires foreign investments. Such are usually hard to attract if your infrastructure is poor. An evil circle, indeed, and fruit is to blame. 
However, the actual sinner isn't the fruit itself, but us, eating it without having a thought of what we're really doing. Celebrating the suffering of others, that is. Undemocratic, corrupted governments get our support. In fact, we are paying for the imprisonment of fruits and workers. This is obviously unknown to most fruit-eaters; at least I hope so. Otherwise, nearly everyone in the western world has got a certain amount of fascistic sympathies. If that is the case, I am deeply terrified of what shapes this could take in the future. Who is nothing but a fruit-eater today, might be the Himmler of next decade. 
This terrible future scenario could easily be avoided. Human beings do not need fruit. I know this for sure, since no fruit whatsoever has passed my throat for over a year. My intellect is at its peak, and I hardly ever get a cold. There might be people out there who couldn't give up fruit eating because of the taste, but as I recall, there are no tasty fruits. What strikes me is that many vegetarians have stopped eating cows because of the same reasons that stopped my eating fruit. I find this rather curious, since it's obvious that a cow pacing the rich fields of Scania suffers less than a trapped banana in a miserable Latin American plantation. By now, I really hope I've convinced you that eating fruit is simply wrong. There is no point in it, and it causes pain. Please join me in my struggle. Do not eat fruit!",0
313,5018.a2.txt,It isn't all about laughs,"When I was a kid I read comic books. Of course I did, who didn't? My parents thought I would stop when I got older since it was all nonsense anyway. But what they were unaware of, and so are most people I meet, was that there is a great world of literature in the comic form, hidden away from the public eye for different reasons that are the topic of another essay altogether. It is my opinion that comics should be put to use in education of children (and perhaps also adults but that also will be left out here). My reasons are simply that all involved, children, comics and education, will benefit from such an arrangement.
It may not be obvious to the uninformed but reading a comic book is not something that is necessarily the most banal form of escapism. In reading the comic book you take in the combined effort of image and text. This is obviously something that makes the reading easier. Illustrations are already used frequently in children's books, to lighten the reading, to enrich the reading. No one questions this. But if the text were to wander in to the image it is suddenly something silly, a ""low"" form of culture. The way I see it, it's the other way around. When you read text and image at the same time, the mind can assimilate more information, understand more on both a facts-level and an emotional level. In the comic, a medium with as much international variety as the novel, children can find education and information about the world and about human beings. Of course it is not in itself a very good technique in teaching math but even there it might be used as a supplement.
Maybe someone feels like arguing that the larger gain is on the other side of exchange, the comic book will benefit the most. This may to the general public be a marginal argument for putting comics to use in schools. However, I hope to turn you all around and make you see that the world would be a little happier if the comic book wasn't such an obscured medium. ""Obscured"" I can hear someone muttering, ""They're always in the papers."" Certainly, the regular comic strip appears in newspapers every day but there is an abundance of comic books, little independent creations only read by a few. If the comic book was used in schools, they would soon rise in status and more people would read all kinds of comics. This would result in more money to publishers and creators of course, which isn't necessarily a good thing. But I believe that when money and a rise in status is combined there is a good chance in even greater work being done. Because there is indeed some grounds to present status of the comic book, much of what is produced and sold on the newsstands lacks in quality. The situation would improve if people had another attitude towards comics, access to the good stuff would be better.
Furthermore, I believe that even the education itself would be better. This might seem a daring statement but bare with me and see if you don't agree. Often enough to worry us all we hear reports on how difficult the situation is in our schools. Now, I'm not suggesting that I have the solution to the hardships of being a teacher but still, couldn't this be a tool? Let's say a teacher has a few troublesome pupils in class. They are likely to take up much of the teachers time and thus creating an unfair situation where quieter pupils find themselves unpriviliged. Perhaps the comic book, which I hope I have established here as a medium with information-qualities as well as being something that will fascinate readers, can be of use. 
In conclusion I would just like to say that it's odd to me how the comic book has been overlooked in educational environment. To me it has always been the joy of reading and experiencing one thing that led me to new endeavors. This is basically what made me sure that children will benefit from reading comics in school, they will find joy in learning. The fact that the comic medium will benefit from this is perhaps of secondary nature but a better education should at least capture the eyes of the teaching community.",0
315,5021.a2.txt,Laboratory Convicts,"You're walking down an eerie aisle in a laboratory. On each side there are cages, hundreds of them, and it doesn't seem to have an end. Several pairs of sad, lonely eyes looks out on you from behind the bars. Some of the animals lay on their sides, shaking in some unimaginable pain. Their faces lights up with fear as you approach them, and they scream.

The next thing you know, you're walking down a corridor in another building, and you hear laughter. The people in this place eat good food, sleep in nice beds, earn some money, watch television, work out in the gym and read good books. They have it all. They have to stay in the building, though. These men and women have all done terrible things. They have robbed people, mistreated animals, been dealing with illegal business or maybe they've even killed people.

The animals in the beginning are laboratory animals, they are trapped in cages that is too small, they are being tied down and force-fed chemicals and poisons, just so that we humans will know the effects, and side-effects, of some drug. Why not do the experiments on the prisoners instead? Let's think about it;

If the laboratory animal is in pain due to the experiment, you have to cut the animal open to see the effects of the drug. A convict, on the other hand, can tell you exactly when, where and how it hurts, and thereby help the scientists to do their work faster. Also, you wouldn't have to test the product once more to find out if it's harmless to people, because you would get the human side-effects at the same test.The animals are born into the world of pain, and it's not fair. They haven't done anything wrong. Why do humans treat their co-beings so badly? We're supposed to be the superior race of this planet! 

The people in the jails are, apart from the animals, not innocent. They have done many different things, but those are not good things. Some of the people are in jail for life, and some even for death. It is mostly these people I'm talking about. The ones who are sentenced to death could be given a choice; either die, or let science use their body. I'm not suggesting that the testing should be painful or humiliating, the convicts would be treated kindly. It would be a great way to make up for the damage they've caused society. Why should murderers and rapists have a better life than little innocent animals? The tests should be performed on those who deserve it!

The fact that something like that awaits you when you go to jail might make people more afraid, and not very eager to commit a crime. In this world, the jails are good. So good that some of the homeless people on the streets commit crimes just to have a roof over their head in the winter. I think that is absurd. The prison should be a dreaded place, a place you don't want to go to. But in our society I can understand that the crimelevel is very high, because you live a better life in jail.If we were to introduce this type of punishment, maybe it would discourage the minor criminals, and perhaps the major criminals too. 

Of course we will need animal testing as well. I have no problem with pharmaceutical use of the animals. It's the cosmetic tests I don't like. They pour mascara in the rabbit's eyes, force-feed the guinea pig with nailpolish, rub sunblock on the mice's backs and let them lay under a hot lamp until their skin boils. I love animals, it hurts me so much to know that they are suffering. These unnecessary tests could easily be done on convicts. Let them eat skinlotion and spray hairspray in their eyes.I'm for more severe punishments, and this is one of them. It sounds heartless, but think about what we are doing to the animals, if that isn't heartless, then what is? Next time you walk down that laboratory aisle, you may notice a big difference; the cages are almost all empty. And that's because the laboratories don't need as many animals as before. Thanks to the new project, millions of animals won't suffer, and the aisle won't be so eerie.",0
316,5022.a2.txt,The end of the monarchy,"It is time to abolish the too long borne paradox of having a hereditary head of a democratic country like Sweden. How can it be defended? As I see it, and as I will show here, there are no reasons why the monarchy should not be dismantled as soon as possible. Firstly it is a hypocritical blot on our democratic to have a hereditary head of state. Secondly it is stupefying not to recognise that the reasons for keeping it now are simply a romantic admiration for aristocracy and thirdly that there would be no damages or affections in a hypothetical dismantlement.
The most fundamental reason for abolishing the monarchy is of course the preposterousness of the post, as national and international representative for a democratic country, being hereditary. It is a paradox which makes the entire democratic debate loose credibility. The Swedish monarchy is of course no immediate threat to the democracy, but if no reasons are left for keeping it, then it seems strange not to follow the transition through. Some may say that the monarch is only the ceremonial leader - but is it not a matter of principle rather than actual power, since the king/queen has no political influence anyway? 
This lack of power makes the monarchy superfluous. Its uselessness and out-datedness can be seen through the screen of historic and fictional fascination, but in the real world this only leads to the kind of awkward position we are in today where a monarch without any power is still treated as superior because of old times sake. In role-plays and fantasies- fine, but it does not belong in reality. Keeping the monarchy shows a dullness and a stupidity. I say stupidity, because what else has possessed us to keep it? It is kept due only to a romantic notion of an aristocratic system which has not been up to date since the dark ages and even then it symbolised tyranny and feudal repression. It is time to take the step and admit that it no longer has a place in our society.
Being thus stupefying, the monarchy has nevertheless kept its foot in through this romantic want for tradition and perhaps also a misguided protectiveness towards the people. But the truth is no one would really be affected, were the monarchy to repealed, except for the royal family itself, being deprived of the already humiliating task of cutting ribbons at openings, and parts of the older generation who enrich their lives with the latest society gossip. The former might experience a passing feeling of being at a loss, but some representative commission could be organised for them as a transitional solution. The latter group should be satisfied by all the new gossip ensuing from this upheaval of the family they associate themselves with to such an extent. On the international level the results of an abolishment would be even pettier.
Seeing that these are very modest consequences, there is no real need for a substitute. As far as international matters are concerned, the monarchs neutrality already limit him/her to dealing with humanity questions, something which could be handled by the appropriate minister. In national matters the monarchs' role as ceremonial leader would have to go to either the prime-minister or some other (not necessarily political) Swedish authority, local or national, depending on the circumstances.
There reasons for abolishing the monarchy thus carries far greater weight than any arguments for keeping it. There are, as I have shown, no defendable draw-backs to its dismantlement. Getting rid of this hypocrisy would strengthen our moral conscience and amplify our belief in democracy. Shall we allow a blot like this to make us if not liars, at least contradictory, simply because it is the way it has always been? The monarchy is long since outdated and remains now only as a romantic notion of past times. It is not unreasonable to ask weather it is not time to take an active stand in the question of the monarchy's future and breaking the long passive acceptance of such a bizarre institution.",0
317,5023.a2.txt,ABOLISH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT!,"Even though we have now entered the 21th century the capital punishment is still being used in several parts of the world. Usually, this sentence is used when a murder has taken place (although, in some parts of the world, you can be sentenced to death for far less serious crimes), but what is such a penalty if not murder? Who gave us humans the right to decide over life and death? What exactly makes us think that we have the right to take another person's life? Some people might refer to the Bible, which confirms this kind of punishment. However, relying on the Bible may not be the best of decisions since it also considers it a right to sell your own children. We don't even know whether the Bible really is a historically correct production or just fiction. Even if it would turn out to be historically correct we can not follow the rules of a society that existed 2000 years ago.
Today, many innocent people are sentenced to their death every year. In most cases the internee will not even be proven innocent until it's too late. Imagine to be accused of a crime you haven't committed, and then imagine being sentenced to death for it. It may not be the execution itself that would be the most frightening experience, but the waiting for it. Many internees have to wait several years before the sentence is carried out. I imagine you must feel such terror knowing that for each day that passes you get one day closer to the day of your own death. This treatment of the inernees can not be considered as anything else but inhumane.
Inhumanity is certainly not something that belongs in the society of today, or in any society at all for that matter. Through the years the world has seen so much injustice and inhumanity that one is surprised to see that not much change has yet taken place. We might not be able to stop all of the injustices in the world, no matter how much effort we put in, but we can at least start by abolishing the injustice carried out in the name of the law. The capital punishment should be someting of the past, not the present. The world must realize that taking one life does not bring back another.
A life sentence, however, should be a far better choice than the death penalty. If you get sentenced to life you know that you are never getting out of prison, you will never be free again. You will have to spend the rest of your life thinking about your actions, and you will never be able to escape from your own conscience like you would if you were executed. I assume that the whole point of the legal system is to create justice and to punish the guilty. What better punishment is there than to make sure that the guilty never forgets what he/she has done?
As mentioned in other words earlier, the capital punishment violates the human rights. Everyone should have the right to be treated with dignity. A murder is an extremely serious and horrible crime and should naturally be punished severly, but it should not be punished by death. We have to stop using the ""eye for an eye"" system. The world is definitely not perfect, and will most certainly never be perfect for that matter, but we have to start somewhere. In this time of ours there is no room for a legal system that justifies execution. If we want the world to make a change towards the better we can not just sit around and wait for this change to appear by itself. We have to take action and a good way to start is to abolish the capital punishment.",0
318,5024.a2.txt,Long live the Majesty!,"The monarchy is always a recurrent issue of debate in Sweden. Some argue that it is an old-fashioned institution which there is no room for in today's Sweden. Others are stating that we would be better off with a president elected by the people. I am not so sure that they are right. Why change a concept that has proved successful? 
The monarchy is a good symbol for our country. The royal family, and perhaps the King, Carl XIV Gustav, in particular, represents Sweden on various occasions both in Sweden and abroad. A representative of the royal family is often seen at openings of various kinds, attending exhibitions, engaging in different matters, and so on. As representatives of Sweden, the King and Queen Silvia, and sometimes Princess Victoria too goes on state visits. Queen Silvia is specially interested in children's rights and that is contributing to keep up Sweden's good and caring name in the world. Here in Sweden she even has her own fund, raising money for helping disadvantaged children. The King and his family is also politically neutral, and it is therefore suitable that they continue to be our representatives and remain symbols and spokesmen for our country.
Some might argue that monarchy is out of fashion and that there is no place for a monarchy in a modern country like Sweden. I do not agree! Our monarchy is one of the oldest in the world and the whole institution is a fine example of keeping of traditions. The house is fabulously vivid, today as well as hundreds of years ago. This is not outmoded, it rather indicates stability, continuity and security in our country. It is an institution we can trust, and that gives a signal that Sweden as well is a country to be trusted. Imagine what it would be like if we were to elect a new head of State every other year! The United States has proved that elections could be a really confusing and tedious procedure. Also, apart from the fact that it is boring and tiresome to select a candidate, there might be a risk that Sweden would be entirely represented by men. Just compare with the United States and France for example, where there has never been a female president. A change in the constitution in 1980 changed the order of succession, so that the oldest child of the Monarch is to become head of State, like Princess Victoria. The House of Bernadotte is also well-known in Europe and the rest of the world. If we were to change all of a sudden, people would get confused and ask 'who is the head of State in Sweden, anyway?' It would also entail a lot of complicated administrational work if we decided to switch form of government.
At last, I would like to point out the popularity of the monarchy in our country, and especially the popularity of our present Royal family. People trust their King and his family. It is not only here in Sweden they have gained popularity, but also abroad. Our house is very popular in, for example Spain where, according to a poll, they seem to like Princess Madeleine particularly much. This raises our status abroad, and makes more and more people aware of the fact that there is a small country up north called Sweden, which is worth counting on!
By this, I should have proved that there really is no need to change from monarchy to republic. Our royal family is a splendid, well-recognised symbol of our country, it stands for stability and tradition and is very popular both in Sweden and in the rest of the world. Imagine the Nobel Prize ceremony and the party without our King! Imagine all traditions that would be lost, and how empty it would feel. As I wondered above: Why change a concept that has proved successful?",0
319,5025.a2.txt,There is no place for a monarchy in a democratic country like Sweden,"Once upon a time there was a nobleman named Gustav Eriksson, who made himself king in order to take control over Sweden and its citizens. That was almost 500 years ago. Today we have a fully developed democracy except for the monarch who sits just as safe on his throne as Gustav once did. Although without any real power, there is no place for a king in a modern democratic society. I will focus mainly on three issues namely: equality among people, the kings contribution to the class society and lastly on the tremendous financial burden the monarch is for the country.
The world, especially the richest part is constantly evolving into a more individualistic society. Consequences that can be seen are that you are only responsible for your own actions and not of those inflicted by people who happen to share some of your genetic code. We have left the right to inherit an office long ago, however that is not the case with the king. For some reason we elect the prime minister but not the monarch. What is there to say that Mr Persson's heir is less qualified as prime minister than Victoria is as queen? If we aim for equality at birth should we not eradicate the right to inherit the office of monarchy? This rest of the old class society is not healthy for the equality among people.
One might think the old structure of classes is gone, but it has merely undergone a change. It used to be king, nobles, merchants and peasants; now this has changed into a system largely based on wealth with the king still on top. This might have been reasonable under the former dictatorship in earlier centuries, but it is clearly obsolete now, especially when the monarch does not have any real power and is not even considered to be the leader of the country. I maintain that the king is a symbol for the class society, and if we want to decrease class importance, one step in the right direction is to get rid of the monarch. Why spend money on a bad symbol that has become obsolete a long time ago?
In a time where welfare systems are being threatened do we really want to spend money on something as useless as keeping an old relic? The royal family cost annually 300 million crowns. The royalties are the only ones that have gotten a fortune without earning it. How can we really justify this luxury when there are people suffering? Let them work like the rest of us. It is not like they are poor or anything. I bet the former king would be quite popular as some kind of spokesperson or entertainer. He would have no problem earning his living. Maybe they would be more useful to Sweden as free individuals than as royalties, with all the useless receptions and inaugurations. We already have normal people performing these duties perfectly well, showing us that there is simply no need for a royal family.
I have been trying to show that we really do not need monarchy. It is an old relic reminding us of days when society was living under oppression of a dictator like regime. A world where we were not created as equals, but in a world of strongly enforced segregation. There is a reason we do not inherit professions any more and that is to keep us as free as possible. I actually feel sorry for Victoria to have this obligation as a crown princess just because she happens to be the oldest offspring of our king and queen. She will never experience the joy of opportunities that lies ahead of any other person her age. All in all there is no use in paying for something that promotes old discarded traditions that undermines the progress of our society, especially when it might not even be desirable by the royalties themselves.",0
320,5026.a2.txt,Make English the 'lingua franca' of the European Union.,"The European Union's budget is a common topic for debate in various medias often with focus on the enormous expenses for the agricultural policy. However, a couple of months ago, the cost of translators and other expenses deriving from the language diversity within the Union, passed the provisions policy in the monthly overview in the EU's budget. Currently being Europ-ean Union's third largest expense, the language problem is no longer a concealed internal issue but a burning official matter that must be debated in all countries and levels within the EU. It is time to choose a language to be used in all professional situations of the Union! For most of us that language should naturally be English. 
Obviously it is no longer economically defendable for people working within the Union to speak their native languages at work but we must decide on one. We don't need to look very far or make deep analyses to notice that English is the superior practicable 2nd language among all the member states and the countries, with France in the lead, unwilling to realize this must try to lay down their pride and see to the best of the Union. It must here be clarified that the idea is not to give up our own languages but simply to find a new area where we can unite in times of separation. The war in former Yugoslavia not only tested the EU as an organization but also threatened the solidarity and stability that took us so long to create. Furthermore, there seem to be a widely spread fear of selecting English as a common language mainly based on thoughts of one country 'ruling' Europe again, a scenario hardly probable with a common market and Monetary Union just to mention a few of ties between member states. Similarly one is stating that Great Britain would be privileged in the work of the Union seeming to believe that it would be some kind of ongoing 'competition' of using the best grammar, neatest accent etc.
To make English the 'lingua franca' of EU would also make the decision making more efficient, this being looked upon as an almost ridiculously long process with many and serious misunderstandings due to the different languages used. For instance, almost a week of work in an Italian committee was recently done in vain when predicting tax-income on fruit and vegetables, meant to be fruit only. The Italians use the same word for fruit and vegetables. Ironically one of the main arguments for still using our own languages is stated to be just to avoid misunderstandings.
Often argued is that the reason for speaking our native languages in, for example the parliament, is to be able to express what one 'wants' to say but not just what one 'can' say. It would for certain see to the best of the Union if all politicians could express themselves in English, the language being the superior used one in international affairs. But the implement of 'English-only' would of course demand better knowledge of the language among our politicians but also, and more important, create a greater command of English amongst the citizens in general, something that is necessary to participate and take advantage of the new ""Free Europe"". The citizens in the countries where English is not stressed as a 2nd language suffer involuntary lock out from the possibilities of today's Europe, rather being separated than united with the rest of us.
It is no longer justifiable to put national pride and prestige at the expense of the Union's efficiency and common interest. Choosing English as a common language would evidently not only save money and make the work more efficient but would also be a new exciting area where we can unite with nothing to loose. It would be a long process but entirely positive, creating a broader general command of English among the citizens and give the same opportunities for everyone. Isn't equality and stability some of what the Union stand for, or at least wants to create? It is time for the EU to decide what path to walk; either continue wasting the organization's money and let an obstinate narrow outlook dominate the work of our Union or change the language problem to a source of greater feelings of solidarity at the same time as developing the European Union as an organization. There is no need to stop at this crossroad.",0
321,5027.a2.txt,Give the elderly a decent treatment,"The whole idea of having the elderly at their respective families instead of having them at a home for the aged is absurd. Although if the two alternatives may give an equal amount of arguments I can't see why there can be any doubt of which side to take in comparison of the two options.

To begin with, who in each family should be responsible of taking care of that the elder will be getting the right medicine at the right moment. On the other hand, you can always educate people in general medicine. But, you will never reach the same trust like you do if a real nurse is taking care of it. Moreover, accidents come whether you want them or not. And in situations of that kind you can count on a proper behaviour when it comes to solving it, if your elder is surrounded by professionals instead of amateurs.

Secondly, how can a family have a twenty-four hours control as you have in state care. Of course, it is just to split the hours between the familymembers and go on with this schedule every week. As a result of this solution comes the inevitable question of how much each familymember are willing to sacrifice to secure this twenty-four hours control. You can't guarantee that everyone always will be able, or want to follow a schedule like that. In contrast, if you just use persons who are educated and trained for a specific task, they will do all that is required from them. Because why would they otherwise choose it as their profession. Therefore it would be wrong to even think that a family can be as reliable as a home for the aged. Relationship is indeed something valuable, but it is simply not just enough in this issue.

In addition to how it will be for the familymembers to give up a certain bit of their spare-time to manage to solve it, you must look on the other side of the coin. No one can possibly come and say that any elder, who has been brought up to get things done, would like an situation where he or she would be a burden instead of an asset for the family. The elderly will with no doubt feel that they are limiting the other familymembers wills to do stuff which they get more satisfaction from, when they have to be stuck at home watching them instead. These two statements may assume to that any kind if sickness has to be involved to create this understanding. But, in fact that is not necessary at all. Just the thing that the elderly can't be home alone even though that they are in great condition is enough to describe why it is like that. For who can you blame if something happens to your old relative when you or someone else not are present. This fact is just another thing you can avoid if you leave it to the professionals.

Next problem which will appear if we let the elderly become a family matter is unemployment. Homes for the aged is one of the largest working places in our current society. Because if the families should look after the elderly they can't hire anyone else to do it for them. And then there won't be any similar place to go to for all the people who are working at any home for the aged at the moment. For this reason they won't be out of options but it is not easy to find something else to do just like that. Everyone will not have the will or the potential, which is demand if they want to avoid unemployment.

Thus, the elderly deserves to feel that they can contribute with something and that they fill a function without interfering some other person. The elderly must get good treatment at any time and they should feel confident that they are in safe hands if something happens to them. This is not an illusion, it is how the reality should look like when everyone reaches an higher age. But it will just be an illusion if the elderly becomes a family matter.",0
322,5028.a2.txt,EU - THE WORLD'S CHANCE FOR PEACE,"In recent times the whole debate about Sweden's membership in the European Union has revived. The riot in Gothenburg in the beginning of this summer was only one of many expressions of this and how some people argue that Sweden should now leave the EU. The sad thing, though, is that the same people, who think they are fighting for democracy and against a control of a sovereign power, might actually be the ones who are the greatest danger against democracy in our country. The thirteenth of November 1994 Sweden decided, in a democratic way, that Sweden wanted to be a part of the European Union. So if now Sweden, through a democratic election, has come to the solution that we want to join the rest of Europe and together work for a better world. How come then that some people want to break that up, through mainly peaceful actions but also actions of violence, and call that a defence of this same democracy? That is absolutely ridiculous. The question we also need to ask is; if now Sweden would leave the EU, besides the ridicule from the nations around that we would receive, what are we actually leaving and can we afford it? So often the resistance of the European Union is built on ignorance and a lack of knowledge. It's easy to be against something just for the sake of it. But what really are we against?

The core thought of the European Union is peace. Just after the Second World War, when big areas of the European continent were in despair and collapse, some people from key-nations in Europe gathered together to find a solution and to hinder war from ever returning into the heart of Europe again. Out of this came the unity of nations that during history has changed its shape many times, but kept its core focus, and today is what we call the European Union. Through a political union of sovereign but united states Europe has the chance not just to hinder the outburst of war, but also to eradicate the very heart of conflict itself - division. I strongly believe that the European Union together with the United Nations is the strongest force at work today that is able and strong enough to be something of a key in the process of world peace. We must not forget that the two World Wars have taken place based on the European continent. Here the very force of evil itself has been centred. Surely the history has been cruel to Europe, but finally we seem to have learned from it. What was at that time caused by division can today be healed through unity. The European Union enables peace to be a reality and not just a good dream. With the European nations united as one there is no way that a new World War would break out, at least not with its centre on the European continent. So therefore for Sweden to leave the EU would be a big mistake and would also indicate that Sweden is against this very matter of peace on the European continent. It would not be the first time that Sweden did this kind of mistake. During the Second World War, instead of uniting with the allies to see an end to the war, we opened our boarders up to the Germans to let them pass by so that they could invade our neighbours and we go free. We called it neutrality. I do believe we don't want that to happen again. But outside and separated from the EU we would not be able to guarantee our standing against that, rather we would be weak, vulnerable and open for compromises of all sorts. To be alone has never meant to be strong.

In the view of this our place in the European Union is pretty obvious. It shouldn't take that much effort for anyone to understand and see that. Sweden has always spoken warmly about peace, justice and freedom. These are ""our"" words. Therefore we also need to prove ourselves to be faithful those high confessions of ours. Now the world peace needs and is dependent on a strong Europe that is united and not separated and divided. Therefore also our decisions in Sweden must reflect that.",0
323,5029.a2.txt,Monarchy- an archaic tradition,"Sweden has been a democracy since the 1920s but I believe one cannot consider Sweden to be truly democratically governed until the head of state is elected by the people. The time has now come to shed the archaic tradition of monarchy and realise the importance of democratic values. 
Democracy is a cornerstone in today's society and most people would not want their country governed in any other way. Yet the people in Sweden are not allowed to elect the head of state, a person who represents our country in various situations. That fact violates the right of the people and to some extent also weakens our democracy. Today the Monarch merely serves as a symbol for our realm, a role that an elected head of state could play with equal or more success. If one also take into account the enormous amount of money the royal family cost the Swedish society, one have to agree that all taxpayers should be granted the ability to influence which person to spend that money on. 
Furthermore, one have to consider the burden forced upon the royal family.. To begin with, the firstborn, destined to be king or queen, have basically no other option than to accept the decision made for him or her while still in the uterus. Taking away someone's free will in that manner, cannot be considered otherwise than completely immoral and must be thought of as an abomination. Of course, one might argue that Victoria might very well grow up to be an excellent queen, who enjoys her job, but who can tell what path she would have chosen in life, if given the opportunity. Secondly, it is not only the monarch himself or herself who carries the heavy burden of not having the liberty to choose. It is, unfortunately, inflicted upon the whole royal family,. who are all being scrupulously exploited by tabloid media. The media examines every word the royalties utter and pays no respect to privacy. Surely one must agree, that the decision of being such a public person must be made of choice. Moreover, one can ponder about another duty forced upon royalties, namely the duty of producing heirs to the realm. In today's society it is not an uncommon choice to not have children, would it be possible for the monarch to make such decision. And consider a scenario where the monarch is unable to have biological children or if the firstborn child suffers a handicap. What would happen to the succession? Today the crown would probably be handed over to some other poor soul, who happens to share genetic patterns with the monarch. 
Having read all the arguments above, one might argue that the monarch of today has no real power, he or she does not rule the country. To a certain extent, however, there is some power conserved within monarch. The views and opinions of the royal family still influence the, luckily enough, decreasing number of royalists. The argument mostly used in this debate seem to be that we should not abandon our tradition, but since both good and bad tradition exists in the world today, it cannot be regarded as a good argument. After all, the main argument the people who opposed to democracy used, was that it was not the tradition.
It might take some time to introduce a new system. One have to give much thought to what kind of responsibilities an elected head of state should have. Should it be the same ones as the former monarch or is it better if the person has more power? Finding a satisfactory election system will take time and effort as well, but even so I am certain that in a few decades Sweden will be a republic.
To conclude, the process of democratisation is enormously important and should stand, by itself, as a reason to abolish monarchy. The arguments for keeping it are far to weak and a inherited post of head of state must be recognised as a thing of the past.. Let us remove the heavy load placed upon the royal family and unite the Swedish people in a republic!",0
324,5030.a2.txt,Monarchy - a symbol of injustice,"During the Middle Ages different families in what later would be known as Sweden were trying to make their own head of family to the king of Sweden. If one keep in mind all the different wills from different families, the leader of the country had to be strong or else civil war would break out. In this situation a hereditary monarch was a very good solution to keep the peace and make it clear for everyone who had the right to the crown. However things have changed since the Dark Ages and luckily Sweden doesn't have to have a strong leader anymore and that's one of the reasons why the monarch no longer has any political powers. But one thing hasn't changed; Sweden still has a non-elected monarch in the position as the head of state. In a supposed democratic society like Sweden this is basically undemocratic. The hereditary system is not only unfair for the public; it's also unfair for the crown prince or the crown princess, in Sweden's case Victoria. Victoria has known all her upbringing that she hasn't got any career choice, her future is to become the head of state in Sweden. This has caused Victoria to feel so much pressure that she for a time became anorectic and even moved out of Sweden for a while. To put so much pressure on a person is inhumane and that reason alone should be enough to abolish monarchy. 
Not only is the system with a monarch out of date and inhumane, it's also based on a terrifying idea that some people, just because they are born into a certain family is superior to others. In a constitutional monarchy like Sweden it's not the power to rule the country that is inherited instead it's the wealth and that you become a celebrity without doing anything at all. The Bernadotte family must have an extraordinary set of genes if they are rewarded with these kinds of advantages toward the rest of the population without having accomplished anything. Of course this isn't the case and non-of them are superior to the rest of the population just because their ancestor happens to have been chosen to be king. This way of having a head of state that for centuries have been believed superior to others is to legitimate class differences and is the ultimate symbol of injustice. 
A latent danger in a constitutional monarchy would be if a monarch were brought up in believing that he's superior to others. If the political situation is really unstable at the moment there are a potential danger that the monarch tries to seize power by force and make an end to democracy. This is of course a very unlikely set of events, but you never know what the future brings. 
The last reason why Sweden should abolish monarchy is the large amount of money the royal family gets from the taxpayers. Each member of the royal family gets a salary from the state that is much more than what a usual worker gets, even though an ordinary worker certainly does a more important job than the royal family. I believe that this money could be spent much more wise and would do more good if it was to be distributed to, for example, the educational system, to help the poor or to raise the standard on health care even more. 
To summon up what I have written. I said in the beginning that monarchy was a thing of the past when the system worked perfectly well and a country needed a strong person to lead it. But in a society of today I see monarchy as inhumane for the crown princess that can't choose her own way of life. I believe that the ideas that the royal family is better than the rest of us belong in fascistic thinking, and I find it clear that the money that are spent every year on the royal family can absolutely be used somewhere where they are better needed. I'm of the opinion that both the royal family and democracy would come out as winners if monarchy was abolished.",0
325,5031.a2.txt,"""Equal rights for women to wear lounge suits""","Ladies, how many times do you not cry over the horror of picking something appropriate to wear? Gentlemen, don't you find yourself lucky, or incredible tired, as you watch your lady friend(s) run about like crazy chickens before a party to assemble a suitable get-up they dare to wear? Men have their suits, lounge suits, dress suits and tail dress coats... Women have fancy dresses, ball gowns and evening dresses; all made in a million styles and of different standards. -It is all tradition. Is it not in time for us, in the new millennia and all, to widen the possibilities? Bring forth equal rights (for women) to wear lounge suits at fancy parties!

Why would women want to dress like a man -in a suit? Most likely most women wouldn't want to dress in a suit the same way men does. In our rapidly changing society the sexual roles and definitions of the sex is becoming more and more loose and in many groups women already wear suits like any man would. Yet, your average female would most likely tell you that wear a suit like a man (and so more or less 'be a man') is not something to seek for; but to wear a suit like a woman... is a whole different matter and might be something to look into. 

Since the so-called Victorian age we have the dark suit as a symbol of a 'man in proper dress'. The suit is always stylish and always in fashion. ""Women loves a man in a uniform"" -as the saying goes- and the suit is without doubt the uniform of the gentleman, the businessman, and the man experienced in the ways of the world. I think it is safe to say women have no counterpart in names of clothing.

For the last two decades at least, women have been wearing suit jackets and suit-styled business dresses so why would there even be a need to argue about this -isn't women already wearing suits? -Not really. The women's business suit is a piece of clothing adapted from the male suit into an every-day business clothing for women, originating from the movement to equal men and women in positions on the formerly (and still) mainly man-dominated jobs markets. The women's suit is seldom seen as a fancy dress wear in the same way we view a male dress suit, for example. 

The advantages of a formal wear like a suit (and likeness') is clear -it is a kind of uniform; there is little to question over how to wear it. You might argue that the suit, just like any traditional female eveningwear comes in many different shapes and sizes and standards. However, a suit is still a suit and always has a standard and 'classics' look which is never out of date. One well fitting suit properly taken care of may last for years and years without loosing its touch or shaming its owner. Beside the suit itself there is its additional pieces of clothing that is required of course; such as shirts, ties, shoes and so on. This very important but still additional clothing is used to bring forth the styles of the suit and give it a personal feel. A man unsure of his style may of course fuss over these additional choices like any women before deciding what to wear. Still, once chosen and bought he doesn't have to worry about feeling shame or insecurity over turning up at a party dressed in the same suit, shirt and bow several times in a row. A fresh looking shirt or two, a pair of nice shoes, a suit, and maybe a tie or two as well -and a man has his evening styles in working order. Very few women have the courage and strength to wear the same dress or eveningwear too many times and can always worry of over-dress or under-dress the requirements. Of course, many women just don't have the budget to keep an up-to-date wardrobe diverse enough to supply a need that includes wear for many dinners or fancy dress parties, and is more or less forced to manage them troubles anyway.

Money is something deeply connected with fancy dressing. One can't overlook the fact that most suits cost a small fortune these days -especially if you want one of decent quality. Women's dresses usually come cheaper, but then there it is again -the fact that you can make due just fine with one suit only, but hardly with just one dress. That is, if you plan to attend more than one party or dinner with a dress code in a shorter period of time. A suit is much like an investment when you think about it that way. 

The difference between the dress codes and styles of men and women is strong and a part of the charms of fancy dressing, -is it really desirable to remove it? To remove it, is a strong term and in the name of the human trait of love and fascination of tradition I dare say it wouldn't be something to desire. Many women love dressing like they always have, wouldn't feel comfortable in anything else, and wouldn't trade it in even for the relieved psychological and financial pressure of a suit. Many women also wouldn't feel comfortable in anything like a suit. Still, I dare to keep saying that a lounge suit for women -is something both desirable and about time, too.

A lounge suit is the key word. The right to wear something in said fashion is what it is all about. What is needed is a lounge suit for women! -An eveningwear that is not just another fancier dress, but a standard for a formal female dress/suit. Such a choice for dressing would open the option for women of a ""fancy dress uniform"" with variations, but first we need the right for women to wear anything like this merged into our terminology for dress codes. Moreover, the already cramped fashion industry would most likely love the idea of such a new dress code option for women -imagine the possibilities of the designs on such a female version of the lounge suit and it's likeness'... 

However, for us to get this desirable right or option for women to dress, no legislation or simple change of term meaning would do the trick. What would be needed would be for women to start to dare to challenge the ideals of the dress codes and to crave additions and changes in what the market has to offer. A revolution never starts with an official change after all.",0
326,5032.a2.txt,Death Penalty - Legalized Murder,"Death penalty is practised all over the world. Half of the world is still using it as legal punishment. It is mainly used in Asia and in Muslim countries but also in America. There are many reasons why the death penalty should be abolished. There are numerous arguments against the death penalty and it is difficult to point to any single fact or argument as the most important. Below are a number of extremely valid reasons why the practice of capital punishment should be eradicated.
Capital punishment does not deter crime. There are several scientific studies that has failed to demonstrate that executions deter people from committing crime. People who commit crimes normally don't expect to get caught and therefore the threat of capital punishment hasn't got any deterrent effect. If someone wants to commit a crime severe enough to result in a death sentence he/she would be most unlikely to regard any consequences of such an act. 
Courts are unable to prevent accidental execution of innocent people. On several occasions innocent prisoners have been executed. There are countless cases where evidence has come up proving the executed person's innocence. An execution is irrevocable and should absolutely not be carried through unless the evidences are hundred per cent positive. Normally they never are. It has occurred too many times that evidence or some witness has appeared after trial or in worse, after the sentence has been carried out.
Executions are sometimes torture. Prisoners who have been executed in the electric chair (in the United States) sometimes didn't die immediately. On some occasions the hair begun to burn or the eyes popped out of their heads. It has happened several times that a prisoner's heartbeat has continued even after the power had been switched off
Race plays a role in who gets the death sentence. Death penalty discriminates. If the victim is black or white often plays an important role of whom being charged with capital murder or receiving death penalty. This means that those who murdered whites are more likely to be sentenced to death than those who murdered blacks. It's also proven that black murderers killing a white person runs a higher risk of being executed than white killers murdering a black person. Among the charged persons receiving a death sentence the majority are poor and they are usually members of an ethnic or religious minority.
Executions are very expensive. It is actually more expensive to execute a prisoner than keep him/her imprisoned for life (which normally means 40 years). In Texas for example they can keep three persons in prison for life at the same costs as one execution. 
The alternatives are preferable. By ending a convict's life the state also eliminates the possibility of getting some important answers. What is it that transforms a man into a killer? How has the convict been affected by his surroundings such as family, neighbourhood, work etc. Maybe the answers would be to uncomfortable. Perhaps they would point at social injustice and racial discrimination? Maybe a long-term psychological investigation in some cases would show that the perpetrator is also a victim. Another argument for imprisonment instead of death is (maybe surprisingly) that it's an easy escape. It's agonizing and maybe painful during a brief moment but then it's all over whereas imprisonment for life under poor conditions with no chance of ever getting out seems far worse. Further, during the time of imprisonment convicts can be taught up as unskilled workers, giving them a chance to repay to society at least a small portion of the damage they've caused. 
It's my firm conviction that the death penalty is neither a humane nor an effective way of dealing with crime. It seems to me that this cruel punishment is a result of our desire of vengeance rather than to satisfy a need for justice and peace. The death penalty is nothing but an evident confirmation of the old saying ""violence begets violence"".",0
327,5033.a2.txt,Swedish students and their education,"Isn't it wonderful that we in Sweden can go to universities without paying fees? But did you know that you only can get loans for six years (240 weeks) of studying? What about the loans, how long does it take to pay them back?
What if you want to become a doctor and you also would like to study English for one year? That takes at least six and a half year of studying and you can only get loans for the first six years. How will you manage the last twenty weeks on the doctor's education? You can't study and work at the same time, not on a tough program like that.
I thought it was good to have a wide education, so that you have better chances to get a more interesting job. I personally like to study and would like to do that for many years.
I'm going to apply fore veterinary studies next autumn and then I need loans for 220 weeks. I also take loans to finance this English course. That means that I can't get loans to study, for example, English B this spring. I would also like to study a language abroad, but how can I finance that, when I can't take more loans?
I personally think that it's important that people study on the university. It would be good if you could get loans for all the courses and programs that you would like to take. But you must, of course, pass your course/program to get loans for another one.
At the moment the loans are up to 1062 SEK per week and the grants are 557 SEK per week. Can you actually live on that? Yes, you can, but it's often harder if you live in a bigger and more expensive city like Stockholm for example.
We often hear people talk about their study loans that they still, many years after graduation, have to amortise. How much do you actually pay back? I did a simulation, on the internet at CSN's homepage (www.csn.se), to see how big my loan would be if I studied to become a vet. If I take the maximum loan (1062 SEK per week), that would, in the end of the education, be loans for 254 880 SEK and that would give me a dept to pay back at 284 041 SEK On this loan you have an interest that changes from year to year and you also have an interest that raises your annual amount with 2 per cent each year. This means that you lose money every year that you have never been given; unfortunately this frightens young people to go on and study at the university after upper secondary school.
One idea is that you would get a salary from the state when you study at the university. But what if the students, after graduating, move to another country and work there? Then the Swedish state wouldn't get anything back through taxes, and would therefor lose on giving grants to the students. A better idea is to give loans and if the students, after graduating, work in Sweden for a couple of year, then they could write off the loan. I think that would make more people apply fore higher education. It also would make more students stay and work here in Sweden. For example many nurses have moved to other countries like Norway, because the salaries are higher there. I think that we on this way can get, at least, some of them to stay in Sweden.
This autumn the number of people searching to higher education got lower. As I say; the state must do something to keep young people to search to the universities. If they can't raise the grants, then they at least could arrange so that your loan writes off if you work in Sweden for a couple of years. If a person would like to study for more then six years they must be able to get loans and grants for that. Don't we want more people to be educated? Then the state must do something about it, otherwise more and more people will be uneducated!",0
328,5034.a2.txt,Credit Cards are bringing financial heartache upon young users,"Young people are often eager shoppers who want the latest in fashion, but most often they don't have enough money to acquire all those things they want. Companies aggressively target these young new customers, by offering credits with low monthly payments and no interest. In other words, they try to make them spend money they don't have on things they dont really need. Tempted by this, many young people fill out and send in every creditcard application they receive. 

What they don't notice, is the the terms of payment written in small type on the back of their application. It is here you receive the important information about what will happen when your period of grace has ended. Susan, 18, had just started a new job when she got her first credit card. She used the credit card to buy a new TV, and also a new bookshelf to her new appartment. In the first printed statement she could see the purchases she had made, the total amount that she owed, and the minimum required amount she was required to pay, which was quite low. Susan thought this was great, and the following months she bought a video and some octher fancy things. One year later, her depth was over 50.000 SKR and constantly raising. By that time, financial fees started to be charged, and before she realized it, the minimum required amount of payment didn't pay for much more than the interest.

Is Susan here an extraordinary rash and irresponsible young person? Hardly. She is not the only one who has fallen into such a financial trap. In Stockholm, today more than 75.000 people, both young and adult, are registrered in the sheriffs because of their unpaid credit card bills. Many of them owe the credit companies so large sums that they won't get rid of them in their lifetime. When buying with credit card, people doesn't seem understand that it is still real money they're spending. Borrowed money that they inevitable one day will have to pay back - with interest! That little piece of plastic become like a ""financial drug"". 

True, the credit cards have both rewards and risks. A creditcard can for example be advantageous in emergency situations or when you don't want to carry too much cash. I suppose that is one of the main reasons why they've become so popular. But wouldn't it be enough with one credit card? And why use it for evert little purchase you make? Actually, having plastic cards doesn't give you any guarantees of security, even though it might be safer than carrying cash. A new type of financial criminals, specialized on credit cards, have entered the scene. So never give out your credit card number and expiration date over the phone unless you're sure who you're talking to, or never loan it to anyone. 

Who, then, can be held responsible for young people literally heading toward financial peril because of those credit cards? The credit company who approved their application, their parents, or the individual? One might think that the companies should take some form of responsibility and try to give some help. But no. In the end it is the individual card owner only who is affected. And trapped.

With this in mind, never have an ""buy now, pay later"" attitude to shopping. Note down every purchase ypu make. Before buying something, ask yourself if you really need it, and if you really need it now. Susan, mentioned obove, had to pay almost double as much for everything she bought because of the interest and all the financial charges. If she would continued to pay the minimum required amount each month, it would take her eight years to pay off the dept for a TV, a bookshelf and som fancy things that are probably already out of fashion. So, if you want to avoid a financial heartache in the future, use your credit card with responsibility and respect.",0
329,5035.a2.txt,Relieve our burden!,"For a long time now, it has been a widespread myth that students of today are quite well off, that they can easily afford to do most of the things they want to do in their spare time, and that they have a brilliant future to look forward to. Recently, there has also been some concern about the way students experience the new Swedish system of students' loans. Let me here propose and argue for a new system of student financiation, where students' loans are replaced by grants.
As of today, the old argument that students, upon graduation, always get a better salary when compared to people who haven't studied at the university, is, and has for a long time been, outmoded. As a matter of fact, the surfacing of some new sectors of our enterprise culture - mainly concerned with IT and self-employed businesses - have clearly shown, that nowadays salaries are increasingly rarely dependent on higher education, although that is still often the case. There are quite a lot of students who, after years spent at the university, take the first cautious steps out to the labour-market just to discover that most people of the same age get better paid regardless of whether they have studied at the university or not. This applies to several sectors, of course, but becomes even more blatant when considering jobs related to the humanities; the loans are often seen as an extra burden that the former student has to deal with beyond the problem of getting a proper job, and this is hardly a way to get more people to study at the university, which seems to be a general goal in recent politics.
If students were able to concentrate more on their studies and worry less about their future financial situations, they would most certainly achieve better results in their studies. This would also, indirectly, relieve society of some common inconveniences that are related to students' stress, such as insomnia, nervous disorders, gastric ulcers, etc., which are most likely consequences of students worrying about future salaries with which to repay their loans. The frequently repeated claim, that this reform would be too expensive for society, is easily countered by the fact that there is a considerable loss of public money on the large number of students who drop out of university - without completing their studies and thus getting their degrees - just in order to get jobs outright and be able to pay back their loans before they are eventually written off upon retiring. In fact, there is a possibility that society as a whole would benefit from students getting grants instead of loans, when taking into account all the time that would be saved and better spent on successful studies instead of sheer anxiety. There is no guessing as to how much time students spend on contemplating their outlook, and it goes without saying that much of this time could be put to better use.
Lastly, if students got grants instead of loans, this would probably encourage more people who lack an academic background to study at the university. People who are, under the present system, afraid of taking loans would, with a generous grant-system, at least have a chance to see if university level studies have anything to offer, and in the long run perhaps level out the now existing, somewhat oblique recruitment to the university.
All this goes to show that society would almost certainly benefit a whole lot if students were given grants instead of loans to finance their studies. The times have changed, and nowadays it is often a drawback to have spent several years at the university when considering how much money the average student owes the State and how many people can get a better-paid job without studying at the university. This is hardly encouraging people to go to the university, which could, in the long run, be rather devastating to future academic achievements.",0
330,5036.a2.txt,Why students should be given grants - not loans,"To students money is of great importance, and in order to finance their studies at the university they must either have savings of their own or take loans - and by taking loans they commit theirselves to the life-long work of repaying them. But if this was to be changed and students were to be given grants from the state government instead of loans, I believe that it would lead to great social improvments. The grants would not necessarily have to be as large as the loans that are taken by the students today, but they should be sufficient enough to cover up for rent, books and some personal pleasures. 

The most obvious and important reason to why students should be given grants is because it would give everybody - wealthy people as well as poor - a chance to further education. In today's society the numbers of applications to the universities are decreasing, while at the same time the differences between social classes are increasing. This shows that fewer young people can afford studying at a university and instead a lot of them choose a low-salary work, which does not require any education. I believe that the prospect of future / life-long repayments is frightening to a lot of people and therefor they do not continue their educations. For many people this is the question of fullfilling their dream or not. In a democratic country like Sweden, the question of equal opportunity to education is of fundamental character. 

A second and important reason is that a lot of professions in today's society require many years of studies at a university. This means that huge loans must be taken - and repayed after the studies are finished. In the future this may lead to difficulties in the society such as: Fewer applicants for these professions - which leads to a substantial lack of skilled labour. Those who finish their studies may feel the need to repay their debts ""as quickly as possible"" and therefore overwork themselves, with stress and illnesses as result. 

A third reason why students should be given grants is that it would give them the opportunity to try different educations at the university in order to find out which education that fits them the best. That is, of course, possible today but the huge expenses associated with studying a few terms at each different education might be frightening, so instead many students apply for an education which they believe is ""the right one"" and continue with that one even though perhaps it was not the right one. 

When reading this essay, one might argue that these grants would be just another great expense for the government, and of course that goes without saying. But when considering the consequenses of ""free"" education and the equal opportunity for everybody to further education, I regard this expense as one well worth. One of the problems that may appear is that more foreign students would apply for Swedish universities (because of the ""free"" studies), which would lead to harder competition for Swedish students. But this could easily be regulated by some sort of legislation that would permit only Swedish students these grants. Another aspect of this is, that an increasing number of foreign students would provide Swedish universities with a greater exchange of different cultures, languages and ideas. Another problem could be that of students who tend to study their whole life (by changing courses and classes) and never reach an exam in order to enter working life. But this could also be regulated by legislation which limited the number of years studying at a university. 

As for the conclusion, I would like to point out the fact that everybody should have the same opportunity to further education. In the society of today everyone is permitted to apply to the university, but the expenses that are associated with these studies make a lot of people hesitate. I believe that the only way to ensure an educational system of equal opportunity is to ensure state funded grants.",0
331,5037.a2.txt,The insanity of monarchy,"Sweden, a country that's been a democracy for almost a century. A country with a vivid peoples movement, with elections where over ninety percent of the population votes and with a domination of leftwing (supposed to be anti-royalist) governments for over sixty years - is a monarchy! And proud of it too! The people speaks highly of the beautiful and glamorous royal family and cheers happily and celebrates the monarch on his fiftieth birthday. Comparing this love of the royalties with the facts stated earlier you can't help but wonder: ""How sane is this?"".

The Swedish monarch only possess symbolic powers but still: The country has a chief of state that's not elected by the people. A fact that really should be distressing for most people but apparently isn't. Further, this person hasn't even chosen the job for himself, he or she has inherited it! If the monarch at least had been someone who had applied for or taken the post by a revolution, the people would at least know that the person who is the monarch actually wants to be a monarch and chief of state! 

Personally I can't imagine any other job in the Swedish society that one usually gets by inheriting it. That's probably mainly because of two reasons: First of all, it's impossible to judge from an infant if it's suitable for a certain job. And second: People in general prefers to make their own decisions considering their choice of carrier. People rarely feel good or do their best when being forced, most people tend to feel repressed by that. Considering this you can't help but feeling sympathy for this people who's forced to stand in the centre of attention as monarchs at all times. Being a monarch is probably a tough job and here this people are, with no choice but taking the job on!

Another thing to consider is what the monarch and his, and in the future her, family cost the Swedish society. A society that's running under an increasingly tight budget and can do without the costs of the royal family. Think about all the parties that's being held in the honour of the royal family and what about the expenses involving the castles, education in foreign countries, security, expensive clothes a s o. Most of this is paid with the peoples tax money which is not reasonable.

What do the Swedish society and the monarchs gain from this ancient system then? The Swedish society is awarded with a lot of publicity since royalties often is considered exotic in countries that don't have them. This publicity might generate some income through tourists and maybe ocasionally a Swedish company can be helped by this attention to get an order from a foreign company. To a certain extent they also play a unifying role within the country. Cultural symbols that help Sweden and it's inhibitors to withhold their national identity. What the monarchs gain is obvious: a lot of money, nice houses and the people's love.

But seriously, wouldn't Sweden and the royal family be better off if the people had the power to elect or choose the person who possess the post of chief of state? In other words: a president? First of all, we would then get someone for chief of state who really wanted and had fought for the job. We also would get someone that would be educated, skilled and hopefully have talents that suited the job. Seriously, how well suited is our current king for the job as king? From a democratic view an end of monarchy would be a great victory that would put an end to a system that's kind of romantic but belonging to another era - Monarchs don't belong in democratic countries, elected presidents do! And last but not least: the persons that now are bound to be monarchs for the rest of their lives could start leading their own lives as people of free will.

With all these arguments and facts given above, you have to agree when I say that the fact that Sweden still is a monarchy and loving it, is totally and absolutely insane and have to join in when I say ""The monarchy is dead! Long live the republic!""",0
332,5038.a2.txt,My thoughts about homosexuals right to adoption,"A while ago I read an article in Dagens Nyheter in which six major Swedish political youth associations made a statement in the matter about whether or not homosexual couples should be allowed to adopt children. The chairmen of the six major political youth parties all agreed that homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals when it comes to adopting children. They also thought that adoption by homosexuals should be allowed in Sweden. I found this a bit awkward since my own opinion about the matter differs very much from what seems to be what most people in my age believes according to the news paper. My intentions are to shed light on this matter and also clarify my own opinion.
It feels like the question about whether or not homosexuals should be allowed adoption of children other than their own is just another bump in the road on the way to total equality in the Swedish society. We seem to strive so badly for equality that no one can really see the problems a ""little"" issue like this one can cause in the future. To me this is scary. It's obvious that we have to fight against oppression and prejudices, however it's wrong to use children as tools to reach our goals, furthermore to solve our problems at their expense. Homosexual couples need to accept that they are different when it comes to the human procreative faculty. Since they would not be able to produce children under any natural circumstances they should not qualify as adoptive parents. But what about heterosexual adoptive parents, why should they be able to adopt? Well, since they theoretically would be able to have their own children they should have right to adopt, and they have. 
It's a shame that most of the criticism against homosexuals' right to adopt children is neglected because it is said to be pure homophobia. People should pay more attention to the criticism and examine it's content to gather information about the matter before making up their minds. It's hard to tell what kind of problems a child who will grow up with homosexual parents will suffer from, if there will be any problems at all. Surely we can think that an adoption in any form is for the best of the child, if the parents are accepted as adoptive parents and so on, because the child will most likely have a better childhood. But the childhood of a child whose parents are homosexuals will most definitely be a tough one. The ones in the Swedish society who differs a little bit from the average are often social outcasts, more or less, especially during the school age. Therefore there's a risk that a child whose both parents are of the same sexual gender will have an unpleasant youth. Most people are clever enough to realize that a child with homosexual parents will most likely be bullied for it sometime during its childhood. 
Some people say that everybody should have the same rights no matter what. In other words: of course homosexuals should be able to get married and have children as well as heterosexuals. Thoughts like these don't pay any regards to the children what so ever. If we want to know the children's point of view we either accept adoption by homosexuals or take a look at countries were it's already frequent. Then, if the majority of the children adopted by homosexuals feel as good as children with heterosexual parents while a minority is suffering from different problems, is it defendable to accept adoption by homosexuals?
I find it terrifying that a great deal of political youth associations in Sweden are so convinced about what is right in a matter were I and many others totally disagree. I find it reasonable to let homosexuals adopt each others children, as in letting ones partner be guardian of children from earlier heterosexual relationships. But I don't think that a homosexual couple should be able to adopt other children than their own, it's a totally different matter. The chance of the children getting hurt is too great. I think the matter should be put on hold for a while until we know more about the alternative damages it might cause.",0
333,5039.a2.txt,Echelon - Eavesdroppers Galore,"Privacy, freedom of speech and freedom of opinion are some of the most jealously guarded rights of people in democratic countries all over the world. Democratic governments, at least those in the 'western' world, are presumed by their citizens to adhere to those basic principles of democracy. Citizens who have suggested that 'Big Brother is watching us', have generally been dismissed as paranoid conspiracy theorists. As it turns out, they may not have been too far from the truth. The last few years have shown news items about a global spy network, nicknamed Echelon, operated by the US National Security Agency with the co-operation of the UK, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. 
Echelon is a fully automated intercept and relaying network that listens for certain keywords and catch phrases in Internet and telephone traffic, satellite communications and radio transmissions. If a transmission contains a keyword that the system is set to look for, it will be forwarded to a human operator for further scrutiny. 
The system was originally devised to gather signal intelligence from the east bloc during the cold war, but has grown enormously in scope since that time. It can be used today for completely different tasks, including industrial, financial, and political espionage against virtually every nation, business or individual on earth that has access to a communications network of some kind. The inherent dangers to such a system should be evident.
The dangers lie not so much in the way Echelon is used today (although it is hard to determine the extent of its use; the nations involved are very secretive about its functions and how they use it), but in how it could be used. Claims are being made that the five nations trade intelligence information gathered through Echelon with each other, to the extent that they actually spy on one another's citizens. In effect, this would mean that in the case of the NSA, the fourth amendment to the constitution of the United States has been completely bypassed. A citizen of the United States should not be subject to investigation unless there is probable cause, and even then, he should not be subject to a search of his person or premises, nor should he be tapped unless so ordered by a court of law. Echelon taps everybody, all the time, and there is no one to turn to with complaints. The NSA does not spy on its country's citizens, but e.g. the UK does. The UK then shares the information with the NSA, leaving the issue of legal jurisdiction muddled. Should these allegations of crimes against the constitutional safeguards prove correct, one could argue that the totalitarian system of government in Orwell's '1984' is unpleasantly close.
We might not be controlled by Big Brother yet, but there are alarming tendencies. The only way to foil the Echelon network is to encrypt any and all information that is transmitted electronically. Strong cryptography is essential for online privacy. The best known cryptographic software available to private consumers is PGP, Pretty Good Privacy, written by American programmer Phil Zimmerman. PGP is free, easy to use, and offers good privacy for Internet communications. When Zimmerman first released PGP to the public, he was sued by the American government on the charge that releasing such strong cryptographic software to the enemies of the United States was a threat to national security. The charges were eventually dropped, but the international version of PGP does not offer as strong cryptography as the one for use in America and Canada.. Apparently, the NSA does not wish to be impeded in its eavesdropping. 
Echelon is designed specifically to eavesdrop on everyone that uses any form of electronic communication. Its operators seem to be less than interested in following the laws of their respective countries. It is a serious threat to individual as well as corporate privacy. Should the allegations currently lodged against the Echelon operators turn out to be true, the only right thing to do is to move for immediate termination of the network in its current form. The violation of privacy inherent in the system far outweighs any advantage.",0
334,5040.a2.txt,Having two mums or two dads must be better than growing up in an orphanage or maybe not growing up at all!,"On TV debates you often hear people who think that homosexuals aren¬Çt suited to adopt children say things like: ¬âA child deserves to grow up with both a mother and a father¬â. And of course that¬Çs something we all agree with, but that just isn¬Çt possible even if it is what we all want for our children. So to those with that argument I¬Çd like to ask a question which I think is an important question to think about: Is it better to have spent your entire childhood in an orphanage rather than to come to a family with two mothers or fathers? To me the answer to this question is easy, no it isn¬Çt and here¬Çs why:

When you think about all the children around the world living in orphanages that can¬Çt even provide the most essential medications for their children when they get sick, you feel uncomfortable, because some of them even die before they reach their teens. All over the world there¬Çs orphanages with few means to take care of children in the way we all think that they deserve to be taken care of. But still, a homosexual couple in Sweden can¬Çt give one of them a better life and a family. There are so many children that won¬Çt have a family at all because of that. The number of children without parents around the world is enormous, adoptions might not make the problem go away, but if we allowed homosexual couples to adopt like other couples these numbers would at least decline. Even if it meant that only a small number of children got better conditions to live in, that should be reason enough to make us consider giving homosexuals the chance to be adoptive parents.

Those against homosexual couples adopting says that children should have the right to grow up with both a mum and a dad. However the problem with that opinion is that children already live in Sweden without both a mum and a dad. Just look at the divorce rates, the number of single mums in this country is increasing every year. So I think that a child in a family with homosexual parents can have the same chances in life as a child who lives with just their mum or dad. People living in what¬Çs called ¬Ñnuclear families¬â are becoming unusual. That is a fact, so why does it have to be such a big deal that adopted children doesn¬Çt have that kind of families either?

The importance of having both male and female role models while growing up is as often discussed as having both a mum and a dad, and the issues are of course linked together. I can see why a boy who¬Çs only male role models come from action series on TV might be a big problem. Therefore when it comes to a child to homosexual parents and the lack of role models I simply can¬Çt see that as a bigger issue than if it has to do with a boy living alone with just his heterosexual mother. Actually I suspect that a homosexual couple planning to adopt a child would be better prepared for this problem than a newly divorced mother to an eleven year old son. If you know that your child will have two parents with the same sex you¬Çre likely to look to other family members for support. You might for example have a great grandfather or brother who will be a perfect role model. 

You can have endless discussions about issues like this one. The problem is that while I am arguing with someone who might be against the whole idea of homosexuals taking care of children just because of his or hers own prejudice, children die because they don¬Çt have anyone to take care of them. Can it possibly be that hard to find a way to give children from orphanages good homes with loving parents, whether there are a mum and a dad, or two mums or two dads in the picture? Obviously it¬Çs a problem, but my point is that it shouldn¬Çt have to be this hard to take care of children who just want to have a family, any family.",0
335,5041.a2.txt,OLD PEOPLE'S HOMES - GOOD OR BAD?,"The last couple of months we have heard reports concerning negligence of our elders who live in old people's homes. We have read frightening stories in the newspaper where people haven't been taken care of properly. Sometimes this have even led to death. What can be done to improve the situation? How can we make the elders feel more secure?
The scene is often that nurses and doctors are very busy. They tend to have many people to take car of on a work day which can lead to that some elders don't get that much attention. If an old person's needs aren't being taken care of, he or she may feel isolated and cut out from the outside world. One also has to take into account that it may be difficult for them to express their feelings about a certain situation due to any illnesses or other problems. Newly employed staff have in many cases not managed to ease the amount of work load that is required of them. One of the reasons is of course that more people are getting older these days and that it is hard to take care of everyone's needs. So how are the nurses supposed to know what a certain person's needs are if he or she is unable to tell what is really on his or her mind? Can we avoid cases where people suffer from malnurishment or negligence?
This is why it would be better for the elderly if they could be taken care of by their own family. They would then find themselves in the center of attention where everyone is looking out for their best interest. They need to live in an environment where they know that someone cares and have the time for them and also where they feel that they belong. Of course the family knows best what their special needs are and how to make them feel able to cope with what old age has in store. The sense of togetherness would be an invaluable gift to them. Another good thing by having the family close by is in case they experience pain. The family would do everything to help ease it even if it might take a lot of time and effort. If one compares this way of living to that of having an appartment at an old people's home this is of course a much better solution for the individual. It would hopefully minimize boredom and loneliness that they may have experienced earlier to a great extent.
For reasons stated above, it would be better if families could take on the responsibilities that go with taking care of their elders. This could also be advantageous to other people in our society. For instance, if these houses could turn into student's rooms that would be an enormous help to those who come from other cities to get an education and can't find an accommodation that suits them. Obviously, they need to feel secure and have somewhere decent to live to be able to do well on the courses they take. This would therefore be really good news for them. Accommodations for students have become an increasing problem in our big university cities around the country that is not going to go away. Students cannot be expected to wait for new houses to be built in order for them to feel at ease. So even though the cities strive for the well-being of their students the problems sometimes become insurmountable. By letting the elders be looked after by the family is a step in the right direction to try and come to terms with the problems that faces many students.
When considering the well-being of the elderly it is important that they be taken care of by the family. They need to spend the remains of their days in familiar surroundings with people who not only care but also find the time to deal with their special needs.",0
336,5042.a2.txt,Give your child a good childhood,"With a reduced number of personnel at day-care centres and therefore larger groups of children, every child do not get the attention they are in great need of. This absence of personnel who dedicate time to each child can make the child feel insecure and can lead to aggressiveness and other mental disturbances. If you want your child to feel secure and if you want to be the one who give your child a good childhood, stay home from work and take care of your child the first couple of years of its life.
I think that more parents should stay home with their child the first couple of years of its life instead of letting some one else, or maybe no one because of the large groups at day-care centers, taking care of them. They main argument why you should stay home with your own child is the increase of the number of children who are supposed two be taking care of by every employee at a day-care center. If a child do not get the attention they are in demand of they can feel insecure. It is also hard to learn how to act in a variety of situations in life if you do not have anyone observing you and showing what is right or wrong. Maybe a small boy or girl do not know that he or she is loved if he or she has to spend the whole day without somebody taking enough care. This can lead to strange behaviour like agressiveness, introverted character or some other kind of disturbances. This is in the first place not good for, and very unfair to, the small boy or girl but do make things harder for the whole family and also have bad influence on the society. People with mental disturbances need a lot of help from relatives, friends and the society.
It is to be hoped that parents really do love their child and a god way of letting a child notice that is to stay home from work instead of letting someone else taking care of the upbringing. That is for one thing important for a small boy or girl. Small children have a biological need of being with their parents.
Parents probably require the presence of their child to. It is valuable for a mother or a father to get to know his or her child as good as possible, to have the feeling of being one of few people who really know that little boy or girl. The connection between parents and their child as a small child is very significant when it comes to future relationships.
The main argument against a society were most part of parents stay home with their child, would presumably be that parents have to go to work. From the economical viewpoint this could be hard but I think that a good solution of that problem would be to reduce the taxes for families with a small child or children, in fact this system works in Germany. Another way to make it easier for families with only one working parent, would be to give them some kind of allowance. If a great number of parents would take care of their own children the need of day nurseries would smaller and a big part the money that earlier financed day-care centers could be used as allowances to the parents. 
It could seem like a sacrifice by a mother or a father to abandon work and stay home taking care of a child but there are ways to combine work and time at home. If there are two parents in a family both could work fifty percent each and share the responsibility of taking care of a child. A single parent could try to co-operate with other parents.
There are, as described before, ways to make it work for a parent or parents who wants to raise their own child full-time but of course there are sacrifices in connection with it. I think this is a question of what a mother, or a father give priority to. If parents do not want to jeopardize their careers because of a child maybe they should question if they are the right persons to have a child. I think the most important thing when it comes to giving birth to an infant is to do the best to give it a secure childhood.",0
337,5043.a2.txt,GIVE THE STUDENTS GRANTS - NOT LOANS,"Students in most countries have to take loans to finance their university studies. In Sweden we have free education, but students still have to take loans to be able to pay for rent, food, course literature etc. during their time at university. As a result the newly graduated students start their working lives with considerable debts to the state. Is this really to everyone's best? I do not think so. In my opinion it would be more beneficial, not only to the individual, but also to our whole society, if students were given grants instead of loans.
Firstly, I think that there is a risk that the current system conserves inequality. Not all people get the same opportunity to get an academic education. Let us have a look at the situation in Sweden today. To get a 'Master of Arts' degree you have to study for at least four years. You then owe the state approximately 170.000 kronor, which you must start to pay back once you have finished your studies and started working. With this future in mind there is a rather strong risk that people from certain groups choose not to study at all. 
For example, I believe that people from families without an educational tradition hesitate to study when they have to finance their studies on their own, while people from academic families tend to see the education as an investment. Another discriminated group is the large amount of people who, from different reasons, want or need to start their studies relatively late in life. If you start your studies late you have less time to pay back your loans. Thus you have to pay a larger part each month. In many cases this might be such a big burden that you choose not to study at all.
Moreover, we live in a world that changes fast. It is often claimed that in the future we will have to be more flexible. Because of the continuously changing needs of society we may have to change occupation at least once in our lives, often with a need of retraining as a result. Apart from what I have already mentioned about greater economical pressure when you take loans at a higher age, this also means that people might have to take loans for more than one education, again with the possible consequence of people choosing not to study.
As mentioned above, I believe that a change of systems would benefit our society. If people choose not to study we run a risk of lacking people with certain professions. Knowing that your studies will result in great debts may be all right if you know that they also will lead to a well-paid job. There are, however, lot of professions that require rather high education, but are not well paid at all. One example of this is the teachers. What education will our children get if we do not have enough teachers?
What is more, we need an educated and competent population to be able to compete properly in the fast development of science and technology in the world. Leading companies in Sweden claim that they already have a lack of educated personnel. We need people to study, and this does not only mean the young ones and people from families with academic traditions. In my opinion the only way to increase the number of students is to give them grants instead of loans. 
It can be argued that giving grant to students will be too expensive. However, we have to look at this in relation to the costs of a population without sufficient education. As the employers nowadays want more qualified employees, it becomes more and more difficult to get a job without a university degree. This might lead to severe costs for unemployment if we cannot rise the average level of education.
To sum up, I believe it is time to rethink and revalue the importance of education. We do not only study for our own benefits. More important is the need of an educated population in our society.",0
338,5044.a2.txt,"Smoking ban in restaurants, caf√©s and bars","Smoking is no longer a smokers own business. It has shown after several researches that passive smoking is almost as unhealthy as smoking a cigarette. Everyone should have the possibility to enjoy a smoke-free environment. Most places which are exposed to a lot of smoke are restaurants, caf√©s and bars where innocent non-smokers inhale the smoke.
Jobs in the food and beverage industry includes late hours and a smoky environment. If one could prevent the smoky working environment jobs in restaurants, caf√©s and bars would become more attractive. This would be favouring the catering trade. The food and beverage sector have always had a high turnover rate. This change could lead to an improvement in the restaurant's recruiting-problem. Since they could offer healthier working conditions. 
The furniture in restaurants would last longer if they were not reeking with smoke and full of burn-marks from cigarettes. Restaurants could cut costs for new furniture purchases or having the furniture frequently re-covered. In regards to the cleaning issues the catering trade will save plenty of time when cleaning the floors which normally are covered in butts. The washing-up would also be easier if there are no ashtrays and butts in glasses and on plates. 
The restaurants, caf√©s and bars would increase the sale of snacks since the smokers can not light a cigarette after dinner and have to order snacks or perhaps a dessert to prevent their restlessness. Purchases of ashtrays are not necessary. The guests of the restaurants would be more satisfied when they are walking home with lovely smelling clothes, and not as the present situation, when clothes are reeking from cigarettes. 
A smoking ban would not only favour the catering trade but also the society. For many people smoking is an activity they do when they are socialising with other smokers in restaurants and bars. The prohibition of smoking would decrease the ""social smoking"" in public places and could also result in an increasing number of non-smokers. The society would be able to save costs spent on smoke related diseases. The allergy sufferers would perhaps not have any symptoms of the allergy if they were not exposed to smoke in public places and therefor many hospital visits could be avoided.
Of course it exists counter arguments. The government receives a lot of taxes from the cigarette sales and a prohibition of smoking in restaurants, caf√©s and bar could decrease the sale and would therefore decrease the amount of taxes to the government. But the money the government spends on medical cost related to smoke disease would probably exceed the money collected from taxes. Some smokers argue that it is their right to smoke if they want to. But when it is proved that passive-smokers also run the risk of getting diseases related to smoke, it is no longer the smokers own decision. The present situation makes it difficult for certain people. Instead of having a smoke ban in restaurants and letting the smokers go outside when they feel tempted to smoke, they keep out allergy sufferer, pregnant women and people who can not put up with smoke. Restaurants make small attempts to have smoke-free areas for the people who can not stand smoke. But it is difficult to shut out smoke from one room/corner to another. The smoke still bother the people in the designated non-smoking areas.
The city of Vancouver in Canada initiated the ban of smoking in western Canada three years ago. It is still an issue under debate, since the people have not gotten used to it yet. Spending two weeks in Vancouver gave a deeper insight of the smoking ban. Barowners argue that they have lost sales because people visits the bar less, since they can not enjoy a cigarette while having a drink. However, in the long run people will become used to the idea of smoke-free bars. 
Since Sweden is such a health conscious country the idea to ban smoking in restaurants, bars and caf√©s should come as no surprise to the Swedish population.",0
339,5045.a2.txt,Mars-A giant leap for mankind,"Since the beginning of mankind we have always been curious and ready to endure extreme ordeals to discover new worlds. Take early explorers like the Vikings. They went out from Scandinavia as far away as the center of Russia to the East, as far as Greece to the South and all the way to North America in the West. Consider all expeditions to remote areas such as Antarctica, Mount Everest and the bottom of the oceans, to name but a few. We have thoroughly explored this planet, more than thirty years have passed since we set foot on the moon. It's high time for mankind to conquer our nearest neighbor in the planetary system: Mars. That's why I propose a large scale commitment to a manned mission to Mars. Let us establish a permanent colony on Mars! Sending a mission to Mars to establish the first extraterrestrial colony in the history of man would truly be an enormous project. Something like the 60's great Lunar Project in the USA. Though, what I'm proposing isn't a one-nation effort, but instead a project to engage the entire world community. 
A mission to Mars would be a giant project, and that means more cooperation among nations. The more people of different origin cooperates, the greater the possibility becomes of them recognizing their similarities rather than their differences, thus promoting understanding between the peoples of the world. In this respect a project like this can actually act as a preserver of peace, much like the cooperation among European countries in the European Union. Another aspect of the project has to do with the environment. Just like when man got his first view of Earth from the moon, I think that a settlement on Mars could open our eyes to see what a small and fragile planet we live on. I believe a new perspective on our planet would spark renewed effort to save it. As has been stated in recent years, saving the environment is a global issue. The new network of decision makers involved in the Mars effort would probably be of great help in finding new ways of cooperation in this issue as well.
At this stage you might say, 'Hey, wait a minute, isn't this going to be unimaginably expensive? Won't a project like this divert scare resources from other important areas like healthcare, schools and the environment?' Firstly, I think that we must accept that an undertaking of this size will always cost a lot of money. However, I believe that it must be seen in contrast to the achievement. It is not possible to put a price tag on forwarding the boundaries of human civilization. Secondly, the money and other resources spent on this project would not be wasted. Great amounts of money would be spent on research that in the long run would benefit, not only the Mars effort, but also all sorts of different industries. An illustrative example from the Lunar Project is the new material: Gore-Tex. This material was first developed by NASA to be used in space. Later it has become an enormous industry with a multitude of products in a wide range of areas, such as ski clothing and artificial blood vessels. Finally, spending money on research would benefit education. More students would become interested in natural science and higher education in general. That would further promote hi-tech industries, which in turn would help raise productivity levels in the future. So schools and education would not loose recourses because of this project, quite the contrary.
When summarizing the arguments, I recognize three different points of importance: First, our nature as explorers. Establishing outposts in space is the next natural step in the evolution of human civilization. Second, the 'unifying project.' I visualize the project as being something that could help us humans to gain new insights and realize that we live on a small fragile planet, something to help save the environment and keep peace. Third, the economical argument. Whether or not the project would be profitable depends, I suspect, on how you define profitable. Personally I argue that there would be enormous synergy effects form this project and that the money would be well spent. In the end I would give the project an 'all systems go for launch.'",0
340,5046.a2.txt,Why hunting is necessary,"A never-ending discussion in Sweden these days is the question whether it is right to kill and eat animals. In the centre of this discussion is the production animals such as cattle, pigs and poultry. I am going to concentrate on another debate, a little more peripheral, which concerns the game and our right to hunt and kill it. 

Hunting has a long history in human evolution. We were hunters long before we became farmers. Today no one has to hunt to survive though. Instead hunters are often seen as a bunch of merciless murderers (primarily men) who kills innocent animals for their own pleasure. Even people who eat meat themselves can ask me how I can stand killing an animal in cold blood. The irony of that question sometimes makes me want to laugh since it is my opinion that all humans participate in killing the animals they eat. The only difference is that I, as a hunter, do it openly.

One of the problems all hunters including me have is that we do it for fun. There is no denying it. For people who do not know hunting this may seem to be the same as enjoy killing. Before anything else this has to be straightened out. The killing of the game is only an extremely short moment of the whole hunt. The lifestyle of hunters includes so much more. I have a friend who crawled around on his stomach for several hours just so he could get a chance to shoot a goose. He failed and had to go home empty handed. If his only interest had been killing he could have chosen something easier to hunt. Bringing up a dog, watching it grow and training it to be able to use it as a hunting partner someday is also a part of many hunters life which involves no killing.

Enjoying hunting may be an emotionally important issue in this debate, but practically there is something more important. While humans has taken over the land and used it for farming the predators in our land, bears and wolves for example, has been almost extinct. In many parts of Sweden there are no natural enemies left to balance the numbers of our bigger games such as elk and roe deer. Hunting is therefore an important part of the game-preserving. Economically it is very important because of the damages that wild animals make to the growing forests. Keeping an even and not to big fauna is also necessary to control different diseases, which can be spread both to humans and dogs.

Practical and economical reasons are easy to discuss. The ethical part whether it is right or wrong to kill animals for food is harder. Personally I think we have that right. It has to be under good conditions though. In the society we live in today economy determines a lot of things and the value of a good life often comes in second hand, not only for animals, but in some cases even for humans. That is why hunting is very important for me. The animals I hunt have, for good or bad, lived their lives as natural as possible. My biggest responsibility is to kill them as clean as possible. That responsibility seems to be too much for some people to handle. There are always going to be persons who hurt animals when hunting because they are careless. The majority of the hunters in Sweden have a good education and a lot of common sense and care for their game, as they should.

Personally I only hunt animals that I eat, but I do not object to people who doesn't follow this. The increase of tourist and business hunting frightens me because I am afraid those persons may not always have the right knowledge that is required for safe hunting. This argumentation will probably not convince the real anti hunters but I hope it can spread some light for the common people who never been in touch with the lifestyle of the hunters.",0
341,5047.a2.txt,Park your car,"Did you have problems finding a parking spot for your car this morning? Was the traffic intense and all you did this morning was standing in front of red lights, starring in the number plate of the car in front. I have the solution for your problems. I know it will not be easy but my advise for you is to leave your car at home and ride your bicycle to work instead. 
The nature has taken a lot of damage the latest decades and scientists expect that man slowly kills the possibilities of future life on earth. The forests are dying and the polar ices are melting and many people believe that this is the result of too big industries and too much car use in the western world. Today we cannot survive without our cars - or can we? Think about all the people in the world that do not have any cars. Are they more unhappy? Of course not. People who live close to their jobs can easily and with great benefits take their bikes to work. Likewise can people with a long way to work travel collectively. Here thought I am going to concentrate on why people should use their bikes instead of cars when going to their nearby job. 
A bicycle is very cheap. In Uppsala one can easily find a used bicycle in good condition for between 500 and 1000 Swedish crowns. One can use the bicycle at an unlimited amount of time without having to pay anything. It is practically free to go to work on your bicycle. The parking problem is another aspect you do not have to think about with your bike, parking places for bicycles is always free. There is no need to even mention how much more expensive it is to buy and own a car. 
As a result of too little exercise people in the western world is becoming heavier and heavier. We know that we do not move enough to keep our bodies in good shape. Despite this facts most workers drive their cars to work in the morning without winning a great deal of time. If everybody would leave their cars and take their bikes to work everybody would become fitter and the air we breath would become cleaner, witch also would make us healthier. It is not just the single individual that would save money while using his/her bike. Think about how much money the government would save when everybody were healthier. When we talk about the money the government would save, think about all the car crashes. Indeed we would be forced to deal with more bicycle crashes but they are rarely mortal. Thousand of lives would be saved. 
Eventually even the production in society would increase. If everybody were exposed to fresh air for half an hour each day before work, they would become much happier and could be able to work harder and more focused. We would become much more creative at our jobs and in our spare time if we saw more of our town and nature every day of the year. Today much talk is about thinking in environmental aspects. I believe we would feel pretty good with ourselves when we knew that each day we contributed to a cleaner world. 
However some new problems would occur in a bicycle dominated world. Many bicyclists today do not follow traffic rules. There is a possibility that some sort of traffic anarchy could be the result if too many bikes covered the streets. This should not have to be a problem if bicyclists were informed of their responsibilities against each other. When the number of the cars in the cities would be dropping the cyclists could move to the streets and since a bike is so much smaller than a car the expected chaos would probably never occur. Another problem that many people would complain about is the fact that one cannot really pack so much things on a bike. This is really a problem if you have the habit of buying food on your way home from work. We solve this with the cycle cart.
Do you not feel tempted to let your car be tomorrow morning? Think about all the things you can do for the money you will save. Think about the nature you saves and think about all the fresh air you would be exposed to. Naturally there would be some problems if we left our cars, but the arguments for the bicycle is so heavy that at least my car will be left in its garage tomorrow. My advise is to dust of your bike, fill the tires with air and get out and stretch your legs.",0
342,5048.a2.txt,Stop smoking!,"Did you know that tobacco is one of the most common causes of premature death? Only in Sweden 8 000 persons every year die of diseases caused by smoking. Do you want to be a number in these statistics or do you want to get free from the devil that poisons your body?
You may say that you cannot stop smoking, but I wonder why. Is it just because it is an old, bad habit, or do you actually like inhaling toxins, just as I once did? But, at last I did stop, and I will try to convince you in the following few paragraphs that you can gain a lot by stop smoking. 
I remember waking up with a terrible taste in my mouth and feeling the phlegm all the way from the bottom of my lungs to the tip of my tongue. I remember coughing all day long. Even when I tried to laugh the cough would stop me. I felt like an 80 years old lady whose best friend has been the cigarette for a quite some time. But still, I didn't quit. 
I will try not to discuss one major disease related to smoking, and that is cancer. I suppose that you have already heard and maybe even read a lot about it. Instead, I will give you some scary information about other afflictions. It is not just coughing and the extra production of phlegm, but also a number of other lung related affections and diseases that you can catch. When you get the chronic obstructive lung disease, which is a combination of chronic bronchitis and tissue damages in the lungs and which makes it very hard to breathe so that you eventually need the oxygen, you might wish that you had never begun to smoke. 
There are gases, particles and fumes in each puff from a cigarette that contain more than 4 000 different substances and chemical compounds. We can see only about five percent of the smoke and the rest is invisible to the eye. Some of the substances contained in the cigarette fumes were used to execute people in gas chambers (hydrogen cyanide). Others are used as cleaning agents and fertilizers (ammoniac), preserving agents (formaldehyde) and nail polish removers (acetone). I could round up a number of different substances, but I know that it would not mean a thing to you. It surely never meant anything to me. 
If I cannot scare you with the diseases and substances, maybe I can deter you by making you aware of how ugly you become when you are a smoker. Take a look at your fingers, the ones in which you hold the cigarette so gently, and see if your skin is turning orange or yellow. I used to scrub my fingers with a lemon hoping that the stains would come out. Of course, they never did. One more thing is the bad looking discoloration of your teeth, which you get whether you want it or not. Last but not least when it comes to your appearance, I do not know if you have noticed, but you are followed by the big, stinking smoke cloud.
If you are still a smoker and you have not been discouraged, then my job is to continue by pointing out what you can gain if you quit smoking. After just a couple of days you will start to notice how your complexion is getting smooth and how the color comes back to your face, so that you do not look ill, pale or yellowish anymore. And you certainly do not go around dragging the big, stinking cloud and your breath is much fresher. If you sometimes felt that your hands or feet were cold, even if it was 25 degrees outside, then the reason to that might be the bad blood circulation. Without the cigarettes, all of a sudden, you can feel your toes and fingers even if it is cold outside. And it is such a pleasant feeling. 
To round off my arguments, I will throw the following figures in your face: imagine that you smoke one pack of cigarettes per day at a cost of 36 Swedish krona. This would mean that in one year you would spend approximately 13 000 Swedish krona. Can you imagine what you could do with so much money?",0
343,5049.a2.txt,Why take the boat when you can fly?,"Ever since the human being discovered that you could travel to foreign countries by boat, the means of transport have been improved. The demand for fast transports has however increased. After some time you wanted to fly. You wanted to be free as a bird. The human being took the challenge to built airplanes and made it. The first ones were fairly slow and uncomfortable. By time has however the airplane's rapidity increased and the service to the passengers has been considerably improved. 

Today we live in a very stressed world and time has been much more important today in our society, then it perhaps was in former times. The current expression ""Time is money"" explains a great deal how we live today. 

To mention the medical treatment in the world the airplanes had had a positive influence. If it's an earthquake somewhere in the world doctors, medication and dogs can arrive very quickly to help. Many more people can be rescued thanks to the doctors' achievement at place. Another example is the transports of sick persons. People that have injured themselves abroad and have to come home fast for operation can do so if they can go by airplane. The same is for organtransports. These have to be transported incredibly fast so they still working when it arrives to the persons that are in great need of them. 

One negative thing about the airplanes is that the environment takes a lot of damage from the airplanes. This is something that should, even if it's hard, be improved. I don't know how but it should work, some how. At the same time the industrial boats leak out incredibly much oil in the world's oceans today and nothing good comes out of that either. Every ocean stops living, like the Mediterranean Sea already has. The world's environmentproblems got to stop!

If you are a businessman with the whole world as your office you got to be effective. You have to make sure you get some contracts signed from different people all over the world, and to get those contracts signed you have to arrive to the different people and places pretty fast so they don't change their mind before you get there. You also have to come home to your company pretty fast so you keep the company's production rolling. You can't do this if you travel by boat. The boat is way too slow.

A transport should go pretty fast. Especially if it's for example expensive goods that are transported to private persons. It won't do that by boat. Transports to electric companies that must have small electric products (ordering products) etc. has to be delivered to the company/ fabric quite fast so it wont stop in it's production. If that is the case people maybe loose their work just because the products hasn't been delivered in time. 

Fast transports are essential. By air the world's areas are shrinking and you have the possibility to have the kind of works that I have recently described, without the familysituation should be affected too much.

The world's tourism has increased year after year. More and more people fly further and further away. Today you can travel to Australia by air at the same time what it takes to England by boat. Today you can travel by air over Europe and if you are headed to, for example, Greece you arrive at the same day. That's impossible by boat. This way you get a longer holiday. Now, some people say that they have their vacation at the boat. That's of course one way of spending your vacation but if you want a longer vacation abroad in a foreign country the airplane is the definitive solution!",0
344,0100.a2.txt,We shouldn't exploit animals.,"Exploiting animals, whether for food, clothing, entertainment, or other purposes, is a controversial issue that has been the subject of much debate in recent years. While some argue that animals are a natural resource to be used for human benefit, others believe that we have a moral obligation not to harm or exploit them. In this essay, I will argue that we should not exploit animals for several reasons, including their capacity for pain and suffering, their ability to experience fear and distress, and the ethical implications of treating them as mere resources for human use.

First and foremost, animals have the capacity for pain and suffering, just like humans do. They have nervous systems and can feel physical and emotional pain. As such, they have the capacity to experience fear, stress, and other negative emotions. To exploit animals is to subject them to unnecessary suffering, which is morally unacceptable.

In addition, animals are sentient beings that are capable of experiencing fear and distress. They have the ability to feel and express emotions, and they can experience a wide range of mental states, including fear, anxiety, and depression. To exploit animals is to disregard their emotional well-being and to subject them to situations that can cause them distress.

Furthermore, exploiting animals raises ethical issues. Treating animals as mere resources for human use is a form of speciesism, the belief that the interests of one species (humans) are morally more important than the interests of other species. This is a problematic viewpoint as all living beings, regardless of species, have the same moral importance.

In conclusion, exploiting animals for human benefit is morally unacceptable for several reasons. Animals have the capacity for pain and suffering, the ability to experience fear and distress, and exploiting them raises ethical issues. As such, we have a moral obligation not to harm or exploit them and should consider alternative ways to meet our needs and wants that do not involve animal exploitation.",1
345,0101.a2.txt,Speed limits- life saver or nuisance?,"Speed limits are set to help ensure the safety of drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. However, many experts believe that current speed limits are often too high and that reducing them would help to reduce the number of traffic accidents and deaths on the roads. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of reducing speed limits and the various strategies that can be used to achieve this goal.

First, it is important to understand the relationship between speed and accidents. Studies have shown that as speed increases, the risk of a crash also increases. At higher speeds, drivers have less time to react to potential hazards, and the force of a collision is much greater, leading to more severe injuries and deaths. Reducing speed limits is one of the most effective ways to reduce the number of accidents and fatalities on the roads.

One strategy for reducing speed limits is through engineering and design changes. This can include measures such as adding traffic signals, street lighting, and rumble strips to alert drivers of potential hazards. Roadway design can be adapted to increase visibility, and to naturally encourage drivers to slow down.

Another strategy is increasing enforcement of speed limits. This can include setting up speed cameras, and having more police patrols in areas where speeding is known to occur. Law enforcement agencies can also conduct targeted enforcement campaigns to raise awareness about the dangers of speeding and the importance of following posted speed limits.

Education and awareness campaigns are also important in reducing speed limits. This may include public service announcements, billboards and social media ads that raise awareness about the dangers of speeding, the importance of following posted speed limits, and the risks associated with speeding. This could be targeted to specific groups such as young and new drivers, to ensure they understand the importance of following speed limits.

Finally, it is important to note that reducing speed limits is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Speed limits must be set taking into account the specific characteristics of the road and traffic conditions, and should be evaluated and adjusted as needed.

In conclusion, reducing speed limits is a cost-effective and efficient way to reduce the number of traffic accidents and fatalities on the roads. By implementing strategies such as engineering and design changes, increased enforcement, education, and awareness campaigns, and evaluating the situation and making the necessary adjustments, we can work towards creating safer roads for everyone.",1
346,0102.a2.txt,"I've chosen a rather complex topic, the Internet, for this essay. It is a topic that is disscussed all over the world. There is a ongoing debate about if it is good or bad. I'm going to argue, as it says in the title, that the Internet is the garden of Eden and not the Hades. I'm very aware of the arguments against it. Everyone of the arguments for the Internet, that I'm going to present, have ""dark"" sides as well. I know that there are a lot of arguments for the Internet but I'm only going to use the arguments that I think are the most important.","The internet has become an integral part of modern life, connecting people from all over the world and providing access to an unprecedented amount of information and resources. However, like any technology, the internet has its pros and cons, and the question of whether it is a ""garden of Eden"" or ""Hades"" is a complex one that has been the subject of much debate. In this essay, I will explore both the positive and negative aspects of the internet, and argue that ultimately, it is up to us to use it responsibly and make the most of its many benefits while minimizing its negative consequences.

On the one hand, the internet can be seen as a ""garden of Eden,"" providing access to a wealth of information and resources that can improve our lives in countless ways. It has opened up new possibilities for communication, education, and commerce, and has given a voice to marginalized groups and individuals. It has also made it possible for people to connect and collaborate in ways that were previously unimaginable.

However, on the other hand, the internet has also been called a ""Hades,"" referring to the negative aspects of the technology. It has been used to spread misinformation, cyberbullying and harassment, invading the privacy and security of people. It has also given rise to addiction and isolation. and the access to the dark web and illegal activities are also major concerns.

To some extent, the internet is both a garden of Eden and a Hades, and whether it is ultimately a force for good or evil depends on how it is used. The key is to use it responsibly and make the most of its many benefits while minimizing its negative consequences. This can include being selective about the sources of information we consume, using privacy and security tools to protect ourselves online, and being mindful of the time we spend online.

Additionally, it is important to acknowledge the societal responsibilities in terms of internet governance, and support the efforts to combat online hate speech, misinformation, and cybercrime. Encouraging Digital Literacy and media education for all, could also help navigate the internet in a responsible manner.

In conclusion, the internet is both a garden of Eden and a Hades. It has the power to connect us and improve our lives in countless ways, but it also has the power to harm us. It is up to us to use it responsibly and make the most of its many benefits while minimizing its negative consequences. By being mindful of our use of the internet, and supporting efforts to govern it responsibly, we can ensure that it continues to be a valuable tool for personal and societal growth.",1
347,0103.a2.txt,Physical Education - An Investment for Life,"Physical education (PE) is an integral part of the education system, yet its importance is often overlooked. Physical education is a crucial component of a well-rounded education because it not only improves physical fitness, but it also has a positive impact on academic performance, mental health, and overall well-being. In this essay, I will explore the importance of physical education, highlighting the various benefits it provides to students and the reasons why it should be given a more prominent role in the education system.

One of the most obvious benefits of physical education is that it improves physical fitness. Regular physical activity is essential for maintaining good health, and physical education classes provide students with the opportunity to engage in regular exercise. Physical education classes can help students develop the necessary physical skills, knowledge, and understanding of health-related fitness, and motivate them to adopt healthy and active lifestyles.

Physical education also has a positive impact on academic performance. Studies have shown that regular physical activity can improve focus, concentration, and memory, as well as reduce stress and anxiety, which in turn can lead to improved academic performance. Regular physical activity improves blood flow to the brain, which can help students stay alert and better absorb the information they learn in the classroom.

Moreover, Physical education is also important for mental health and overall well-being. Regular physical activity can help reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, and improve self-esteem and self-worth. Physical education classes can also provide a safe and supportive environment for students to develop important social and emotional skills, such as teamwork and communication.

Furthermore, Physical education is also a great way to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion, in classrooms and schools. As a subject, physical education can provide opportunities for students to learn, appreciate, and respect the differences among students by encouraging inclusive and cooperative learning experiences.

Despite the numerous benefits of physical education, it is often viewed as less important than subjects such as math, science, and English. However, physical education is an essential component of a well-rounded education, and it should be given a more prominent role in the education system. Properly structured and implemented physical education program can have far-reaching benefits not only for students' physical health but also their overall well-being, academic performance, and social and emotional development.

In conclusion, physical education is an essential part of the education system. Regular physical activity can improve physical fitness, academic performance, mental health, and overall well-being. It can also promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. Therefore, physical education should be given a more prominent role in the education system and should be viewed as an essential subject, just like other core academic subjects.",1
348,0104.a2.txt,To be or not be (a vegetarian),"Being a vegetarian is a personal choice that many people make for a variety of reasons. Some choose to become vegetarians for health reasons, while others do so for ethical, environmental, or religious reasons. Whatever the reason, being a vegetarian can have a significant impact on one's life, and this essay will explore some of the reasons why people choose to become vegetarians, as well as the benefits and challenges of this lifestyle.

One of the main reasons people choose to become vegetarians is for health reasons. A vegetarian diet is typically high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes which provides a wide range of essential nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. A well-planned vegetarian diet can also help reduce the risk of various chronic diseases, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Additionally, plant-based diets have been shown to be associated with lower BMI and weight, as well as improved gut health and microbiome.

Another reason people choose to become vegetarians is for ethical reasons. Many people believe that it is wrong to kill animals for food and that a vegetarian lifestyle is more compassionate to animals. Moreover, factory farming and large-scale meat production can be inhumane to animals and can lead to serious welfare problems for the animals, such as living in overcrowded conditions, and being subject to extreme stress. Additionally, animal agriculture can have a significant environmental impact, including deforestation, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. By choosing plant-based foods, vegetarians can reduce their environmental impact and make more sustainable food choices.

Religious and spiritual reasons are also one of the reasons people choose to become vegetarian. Many religions and spiritual traditions advocate for compassion and nonviolence toward animals, and a vegetarian diet aligns with these beliefs.

However, being a vegetarian also poses some challenges. For example, it can be more difficult to get enough protein, iron, and other nutrients, if not planned carefully. Additionally, eating out or traveling can be more challenging, as there may be fewer vegetarian options available. Furthermore, some people may face social pressures or stigmatization from friends, family, or society at large for choosing a vegetarian lifestyle.

In conclusion, being a vegetarian is a personal choice that many people make for a variety of reasons, such as health, ethical, environmental, or religious reasons. While being a vegetarian poses some challenges, it also has many benefits such as better health outcomes, ethical considerations, and environmental impact. It's important to be aware of the nutrient needs and make sure to eat a well-balanced diet. With proper planning and understanding, a vegetarian diet can provide all necessary nutrients for a healthy and satisfying life.",1
349,0105.a2.txt,UNPAID WORK FOR UNEMPLOYED?,"Unemployment is a major problem in many countries, with millions of people out of work and struggling to make ends meet. One solution that has been proposed to address this problem is to give unpaid work to the unemployed, with the idea being that this will help them gain the skills and experience they need to find paid employment in the future. In this essay, I will explore the pros and cons of this approach, and argue that while unpaid work can have some benefits for the unemployed, it is not a sustainable solution to the problem of unemployment.

One of the main benefits of giving unpaid work to the unemployed is that it can help them gain the skills and experience they need to find paid employment in the future. Many people who are unemployed may have gaps in their work history or lack the skills and experience needed for certain jobs. Unpaid work can provide an opportunity for them to build their resumes and gain experience in a particular field, which can make them more attractive to potential employers. This can help them to increase their chances of finding paid work in the future.

Additionally, unpaid work can also provide a sense of purpose and self-worth for the unemployed. Unemployment can lead to feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness, and unpaid work can provide a sense of accomplishment and self-esteem. It can be an opportunity for the unemployed to do something meaningful and productive, which can be helpful for their mental health.

Furthermore, unpaid work can also provide a solution for employers who are in need of extra help but do not have the budget to hire additional staff. This can be particularly useful for small businesses and non-profit organizations, which may not have the resources to pay for additional staff.

However, there are also some significant downsides to giving unpaid work to the unemployed. One of the main concerns is that unpaid work can be exploitative, as it can take advantage of the vulnerable position of the unemployed, who may be willing to accept unpaid work in order to make ends meet. Moreover, unpaid work can also create unfair competition between those who are willing to work for free and those who are not, which can undermine the wages and working conditions of paid workers.

Furthermore, unpaid work can also be detrimental to the unemployed in the long-term, as it can make it harder for them to find paid work in the future. Employers may be less likely to hire someone who has been working for free, and unpaid work can create a Catch-22 situation where the unemployed are unable to find paid work without experience, but unable to gain experience without paid work.

Another important aspect to consider is that unpaid work might not be a sustainable solution for the unemployed in the long-term. People need to earn a living and support their families, and unpaid work does not provide a stable or reliable income. Furthermore, lack of earning can contribute to poverty and have other negative consequences on the individual and their families.",1
350,0106.a2.txt,Financing studies - Sweden vs. Finland,"The financing of education is a crucial aspect of providing equal opportunities for all students, and it is an issue that is of great importance in both Sweden and Finland. Both countries have similar education systems and are known for their high-quality education, but the way they finance their education systems is quite different. In this essay, I will compare the financing of education in Sweden and Finland, highlighting the key differences and similarities, and discussing the implications of these differences for students, educators, and society as a whole.

In Sweden, the financing of education is primarily done through government funding, with a strong emphasis on equal access to education for all. The Swedish government provides a significant amount of funding for public schools, with the majority of schools being state-funded. This funding is allocated based on the number of students enrolled, with additional funding provided for students with special needs or disabilities. This system helps to ensure that all students, regardless of their socioeconomic background, have access to the same quality of education.

On the other hand, in Finland, the financing of education is primarily done through local municipalities. The Finnish government sets national standards for education, but it is up to each municipality to fund and run their own schools. The municipalities are responsible for allocating resources and funding, and they also decide on the educational policies and programs. This system allows for more flexibility and autonomy at the local level, but it also raises the concern of funding disparities among municipalities and schools.

Both Sweden and Finland have free education for all students, from primary to tertiary level. However, in Sweden, universities have tuition fees for students from other countries outside EU/EEA, whereas in Finland, all students have access to free tertiary education regardless of their residency status.",1
351,0107.a2.txt,Stop commercial breaks on television,"Television commercials have long been a staple of the medium, but in recent years, concerns have been raised about the negative effects they have on viewers. One of the main issues is that commercials disrupt the viewing experience, causing viewers to have to stop what they are watching and wait for the next segment to begin. In this essay, I will explore the reasons why breaks in television should be stopped and argue that eliminating commercials would improve the overall viewing experience for viewers.

First and foremost, breaks in television can be disruptive to the viewing experience. When a commercial break comes on, viewers are forced to stop watching the program they were engaged in and wait for the commercials to finish. This interruption can make it difficult for viewers to fully immerse themselves in the program and can make it harder for them to follow the story or understand the context. Additionally, for people with ADHD or other attention disorders, this disruption can make it hard for them to stay engaged and focused on the program.

Another issue with commercial breaks is that they can make it difficult to watch live events, such as sports or news programs. During live events, viewers often want to stay engaged and up-to-date with what is happening, but commercial breaks force them to miss important moments. This can be particularly frustrating for viewers who have a vested interest in the outcome of a live event and can lead to disappointment or dissatisfaction.

Moreover, commercials themselves can also be seen as a nuisance. Many people fast-forward through commercials or switch channels during commercial breaks to avoid them altogether. This is not only inconvenient for viewers but also detrimental to the companies that have paid to advertise their products or services.

352,0109.a2.txt,Thou shall not kill,"Abortion is a highly controversial and divisive issue, with strong opinions on both sides. The topic of abortion raises a number of ethical, moral, and legal concerns, and it is an issue that has been the subject of much debate and discussion. In this essay, I will explore the various arguments surrounding abortion, including those in favor and those against it, and argue that while there are valid points on both sides, the right to access safe and legal abortion should be protected.

One of the main arguments in favor of abortion is the right to bodily autonomy. This argument states that every person has the right to make decisions about their own body, and that this right should extend to the decision to have an abortion. Proponents of this view argue that a pregnancy is a physical and emotional burden on the person carrying it and that the decision to terminate a pregnancy should be left up to the individual who will be affected by it.

Another argument in favor of abortion is the right to access safe and legal healthcare. Restricting access to abortion can lead to unsafe and illegal procedures, which can put the health and lives of individuals at risk. Ensuring that individuals have access to safe and legal abortion services is an important aspect of providing comprehensive healthcare and protecting the well-being of individuals.

Additionally, some argue that women's right to access to education, work and decision making on how to plan their lives, is also connected to their right to access safe and legal abortion services. Denying access to abortion can limit the economic and educational opportunities of individuals and can perpetuate cycles of poverty and inequality.

On the other hand, those against abortion argue that it is morally and ethically wrong to terminate a pregnancy, as it ends the life of an unborn child. They argue that human life begins at conception and that every unborn child has a right to life, which should be protected.

Furthermore, Some argue that alternative options such as adoption, should be considered instead of abortion and that individuals should be given support and resources to consider these options. They believe that every child has a right to be born and raised in a loving and nurturing environment, and that every effort should be made to ensure that this happens.

It's worth mentioning that there are different",1
353,0110.a2.txt,Time is all we got!,"The traditional 9-to-5 workday has long been the norm in many countries, but there is a growing movement to reduce working hours as a way to improve quality of life, boost productivity, and address issues such as burnout and work-life balance. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of reducing working hours and argue that this is a viable solution to many of the problems facing the modern workforce.

One of the main benefits of reducing working hours is that it can improve work-life balance. Long working hours can lead to burnout and negatively affect mental and physical health, as well as personal relationships and family life. By reducing working hours, individuals have more time to spend with family, pursue hobbies and interests, and take care of their physical and mental health. This can lead to happier and more fulfilled employees, which can in turn lead to increased productivity and job satisfaction.

Another benefit of reducing working hours is that it can boost productivity. Long working hours can lead to fatigue and burnout, which can make it difficult for employees to focus and be productive. By reducing working hours, employees are better able to maintain their focus and energy levels, which can lead to an increase in productivity and job performance.

Moreover, reducing working hours can also help to address issues of unemployment, by creating more job opportunities. By spreading available working hours across more employees, more people can have access to paid employment. It can also be a solution for part-time workers or those seeking for flexible working hours and conditions.

Additionally, reducing working hours can be beneficial for the environment, as it can lead to less energy consumption and fewer emissions from transportation. With shorter working hours, employees would have more time for non-commuting activities, which would lead to less energy consumption and fewer emissions.

However, reducing working hours can also pose some challenges, such as financial constraints, as companies may need to hire more employees to cover the same workload. Moreover, some people may prefer longer working hours, and shorter working hours may not be suitable for some sectors or positions. Additionally, reducing working hours could be seen as a way to decrease labor productivity and have a negative impact on economic growth.

In conclusion, reducing working hours has the potential to provide many benefits to the workforce and society as a whole. It can improve work-life balance, boost productivity, create more job opportunities, and address environmental issues. While there may be some challenges to implementing this change, the potential",1
354,0111.a2.txt,How do you justify executions?,"The death penalty, or capital punishment, is a highly controversial and divisive issue, with strong opinions on both sides. The question of whether or not to use executions as a form of punishment raises a number of ethical, moral, and legal concerns, and it is an issue that has been the subject of much debate and discussion. In this essay, I will explore the arguments for and against the use of the death penalty and argue that while there are valid points on both sides, the use of executions as a form of punishment can be justified in certain circumstances.

One of the main arguments in favor of the death penalty is that it serves as a deterrent for potential criminals. The threat of the death penalty can serve as a powerful deterrent, discouraging individuals from committing serious crimes such as murder, as they understand the severe consequences. This can help to reduce crime rates and keep communities safer. Additionally, it can be argued that execution serves as a deterrent for other criminals who may be considering committing a similar crime, and could potentially prevent more violent acts from happening.

Another argument in favor of the death penalty is that it can provide closure for the victims and their families. For the victims of serious crimes, the death penalty can serve as a form of justice and can help them to find closure and move on with their lives. For the families of victims, the death penalty can be seen as a way to ensure that the perpetrator is held accountable for their actions and that they can no longer harm others.

Moreover, some argue that death penalty is the ultimate form of punishment for the most heinous crimes, it sends a strong message that certain actions will not be tolerated and that justice will be served. Furthermore, it ensures that the perpetrator will not be able to commit the same crimes again, as they will no longer be alive.

On the other hand, those against the death penalty argue that it is morally and ethically wrong to take the life of a person, as it violates their right to life and can lead to miscarriages of justice. There have been cases where innocent people have been sentenced to death and later found to be innocent, or where a person's guilt was not clear beyond a reasonable doubt. Additionally, death penalty can perpetuate cycles of violence and does not address the root causes of crime.

Furthermore, some argue that death penalty does not necessarily provide closure for victims and their families, as it does not address the emotional and psychological harm caused by the crime, and that resources and attention should be focused on helping the victims and their families heal and move on.

It's also worth noting that",1
355,0112.a2.txt,The Right To Children,"The right to have children is a fundamental human right that is protected by various laws and conventions worldwide. This right allows individuals to make decisions about their own bodies and to start a family, without interference from the state or any other external body. In this essay, I will explore the concept of the right to have children and argue that it is a fundamental human right that should be protected and respected.

One of the main components of the right to have children is the right to make decisions about one's own body. This includes the right to make decisions about reproduction, such as the use of contraception, the timing of pregnancy, and the use of assisted reproductive technologies. This right to bodily autonomy means that individuals should have the freedom to make decisions about their own bodies and should not be subject to coercion or manipulation by the state or any other external body.

Another component of the right to have children is the right to form a family. The right to form a family is protected by various laws and conventions, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that ""men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality, or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family."" This right to form a family includes the right to have children, and it is an essential part of human dignity and self-determination.

Additionally, the right to have children also includes the right to access information and services that allow individuals to make informed decisions about reproduction and family planning. This includes access to education, healthcare, and counseling services that provide individuals with the information and support they need to make informed decisions about starting a family.

Furthermore, the right to have children also includes the right to not have children. This is often referred to as the right to access contraception and abortion",1
356,0113.a2.txt,MORE MEN ARE NEEDED IN THE CHILD-CARE SYSTEM,"The child care system is an essential part of ensuring that children receive the care and support they need to develop and thrive. However, it is also an area that is traditionally dominated by women, with men often underrepresented in child care roles. This can have a number of negative consequences, both for the men involved and for the children being cared for. In this essay, I will explore the reasons why more men are needed in the child care system and argue that increasing male involvement in this area is crucial for achieving gender equality and providing the best possible care for children.

One of the main reasons why more men are needed in the child care system is that it can help to promote gender equality. Child care is an area that has traditionally been seen as ""women's work,"" and this perception can lead to a lack of opportunities and support for men who want to enter the field. By encouraging more men to enter child care roles, we can challenge the notion that this is ""women's work"" and create a more equal and diverse workforce.

Another reason why more men are needed in the child care system is that it can provide children with positive role models. Children, especially boys, can benefit greatly from having male role models in their lives, and the child care system is an ideal place for them to find such role models. Men working in child care roles can provide children with a different perspective on life and can help them to see the value of men as nurturing and caregiving figures.

Moreover, encouraging more men to enter child care roles can also break down stereotypes and biases. Men in child care roles may be perceived as unusual or less capable, but by increasing the representation of men in this field, such biases and stereotypes can be broken down. Furthermore, it can also challenge societal norms that assign gender roles and responsibilities, creating a more inclusive and fair society.

Additionally, having more men in child care roles can also lead to more flexible work arrangements for families. As men are increasingly involved in caregiving roles, it can lead to a more equitable distribution of care work, giving women more opportunities to pursue education and career opportunities. This can help to create a more equal and fair society, where both men and women have equal opportunities to pursue their goals and aspirations.

However, it's worth noting that there are some challenges to increasing the number of men in child care roles. One of the main challenges is societal stereotypes, which can discourage men from entering the field, and lack of support from employers and government policies. Furthermore, there are also economic constraints, as child care jobs often pay low wages, which can be unattractive to men with families to support.

In conclusion, more men are needed in the child care system. This will help to promote gender equality, provide children with positive role models, and create a more fair",1
357,0115.a2.txt,License To Pay- the price of state television,"Paying for a license to have a television is a requirement in many countries, and it is a way for governments to ensure that citizens have access to a wide variety of programming options and to ensure that the broadcasters are financially supported. However, there are some arguments against the requirement to pay for a license to have a television. In this essay, we will discuss the reasons for and against paying for a license to have a television.

First, let's look at the reasons for paying for a license to have a television. One of the main reasons is to financially support the broadcasters. Broadcasters provide a valuable service by producing and airing programming that informs, educates, and entertains the public. By paying for a license to have a television, individuals are contributing to the financial support of these broadcasters and ensuring that they can continue to produce high-quality programming.

Additionally, paying for a license to have a television also helps to support the production of local programming. Many countries require that a certain percentage of the programming aired by broadcasters must be produced locally. This means that by paying for a license to have a television, individuals are also supporting the production of local programming, which is important for promoting cultural diversity and allowing citizens to stay informed about their local community.

Another reason for paying for a license to have a television is to ensure that citizens have access to a wide variety of programming options. By requiring that individuals pay for a license to have a television, governments can ensure that broadcasters have the financial resources to produce a wide variety of programming options, including news, sports, entertainment, and educational programming. This ensures that citizens have access to a diverse range of programming options and can stay informed and entertained.

Now, let's consider the arguments against paying for a license to have a television. One of the main arguments is that it is an unnecessary expense for individuals. Many argue that individuals should not be required to pay for something that is a basic necessity, such as access to information and entertainment. Additionally, some argue that the cost of a license is too high, and that it disproportionately affects low-income individuals and families.

Another argument against paying for a license to have a television is that it is no longer necessary in the digital age. With the advent of streaming services, many individuals are able to access a wide variety of programming options without the need for a traditional television or a television license. This means that the requirement to pay for a license is becoming increasingly irrelevant as more and more individuals are turning to streaming services for their entertainment and information needs.

Lastly, some argue that paying for a license to have a television is a form of censorship. Governments often use the requirement to pay for a license as a way to control and regulate the programming that is aired by broadcasters. This can lead to censorship of certain topics or viewpoints, which can be detrimental to a free and open society.

In conclusion, there are both reasons for and against paying for a license to have a television. On one hand, paying for a license helps to financially support the broadcasters and the production of local programming. It also ensures that citizens have access to a wide variety of programming options. However, on the other hand, some argue that it is an unnecessary expense, the cost is too high, it's no longer necessary in the digital age, and it can be a form of censorship. Ultimately, whether or not individuals should be required to pay for a license to have a television is a complex issue that requires consideration of both the benefits and drawbacks.",1
358,0118.a2.txt,slavery system of modern times,"Modern slavery, also known as human trafficking, is a serious issue that affects millions of people around the world. It is defined as the use of force, deception, or coercion to exploit a person for labor or commercial sex. This can include forced labor, domestic servitude, and sexual exploitation. It is a form of abuse that violates human rights and undermines the dignity and worth of the individual. In this essay, we will discuss the causes, consequences, and ways to combat modern slavery.

One of the main causes of modern slavery is poverty. Many individuals and families living in poverty are vulnerable to exploitation and may be more willing to accept low wages or poor working conditions. This is especially true for migrants and refugees, who may be desperate to find work and support their families. In addition, individuals living in poverty may also be more likely to fall prey to false promises of good jobs and better living conditions, which can lead to them being trafficked into slavery.

Another cause of modern slavery is the demand for cheap labor and goods. The global economy is driven by the demand for cheap goods and services, and this has led to a rise in the number of companies that rely on forced labor to keep costs down. This can include factories, farms, and mines, where individuals are forced to work long hours for little or no pay. Additionally, there is also a demand for cheap domestic labor and sexual exploitation which are also considered as forms of modern slavery.

The consequences of modern slavery are severe and far-reaching. For individuals and families affected by modern slavery, the consequences can include physical and psychological trauma, lost income, and social isolation. Furthermore, individuals who are trafficked for sexual exploitation may also be at risk of serious health problems, such as sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies. Additionally, modern slavery undermines the economy, as it can lead to low productivity and reduced economic growth.

To combat modern slavery, there are several actions that can be taken. One of the most important is to increase awareness about the issue and to educate the public about the signs of modern slavery. This can include training for law enforcement, healthcare providers, and other professionals who may come into contact with individuals who are at risk of being exploited. Additionally, governments can also take action by enacting laws and policies that criminalize human trafficking and provide support for victims.

Another important step in combating modern slavery is to target the demand for cheap labor and goods. This can be done by implementing laws and regulations that hold companies accountable for ensuring that their products and services are not produced using forced labor. Additionally, governments and companies can also invest in programs and initiatives that promote fair trade and support sustainable development.

Lastly, to combat modern slavery, it is important to support and empower individuals and communities who are at risk of being exploited. This can include providing job training and education programs, as well as financial assistance and housing. Additionally, governments and NGOs can also provide support for victims of human trafficking, including legal assistance, medical care, and counseling.

In conclusion, modern slavery is a serious issue that affects millions of people around the world. It is caused by poverty and the demand for cheap labor and goods. The consequences of modern slavery are severe and far-reaching, and it is important to take action to combat it. This can include increasing awareness, enacting laws and policies, targeting the demand, and supporting and empowering individuals and communities who are at risk. By taking action, we can work to eliminate modern slavery and ensure that all individuals are treated with dignity and respect.",1
359,0119.a2.txt,Reduce the number of entering foreigners,"Reducing the number of foreigners entering a country is a complex issue that has multiple reasons and implications. It can be driven by concerns about national security, economic stability, and cultural preservation. In this essay, we will explore some of the reasons for wanting to reduce the number of foreigners entering a country and the potential consequences of doing so.

One of the main reasons for wanting to reduce the number of foreigners entering a country is to protect national security. Countries may want to limit the number of foreigners entering their borders to prevent the potential entry of individuals who may pose a threat to national security. This can include individuals who are suspected of being involved in terrorism or other criminal activities. Additionally, countries may also want to limit the number of foreigners entering to prevent the spread of diseases or to protect the country from a potential influx of refugees.

Another reason for wanting to reduce the number of foreigners entering a country is to protect economic stability. Countries may want to limit the number of foreigners entering their borders to prevent the potential influx of individuals who may take jobs away from citizens or strain the country's social welfare system. Additionally, countries may also want to limit the number of foreigners entering to prevent the potential negative impact on the housing market and the environment.

Lastly, some countries may also want to reduce the number of foreigners entering to preserve their culture and way of life. Countries may see a large influx of foreigners as a threat to their cultural identity and may want to limit the number of foreigners entering to prevent the potential erosion of their cultural heritage.

However, reducing the number of foreigners entering a country can also have negative consequences. One of the main consequences is that it can lead to discrimination and prejudice against foreigners. This can include individuals being targeted for verbal or physical abuse, and it can also lead to the creation of a hostile environment for foreigners living in the country. Additionally, reducing the number of foreigners entering a country can also have a negative impact on the country's economy, as it can lead to a reduction in foreign investment, trade, and tourism.

Furthermore, reducing the number of foreigners entering a country can also have a negative impact on the country's social fabric. This can include a reduction in cultural diversity and a lack of understanding and appreciation of different cultures. Additionally, reducing the number of foreigners entering a country can also have a negative impact on the country's education system, as it can lead to a reduction in the number of international students and a lack of exposure to different cultures and perspectives.

Finally, reducing the number of foreigners entering a country can also have negative humanitarian consequences. This can include individuals being separated from their families and loved ones and being unable to access essential services, such as medical care, education and work. Additionally, reducing the number of foreigners entering a country can also have negative consequences for refugees and asylum seekers, who may be unable to flee persecution, war, and violence in their home countries.

In conclusion, reducing the number of foreigners entering a country is a complex issue that has multiple reasons and implications. While countries may want to limit the number of foreigners entering to protect national security, economic stability, and cultural preservation, it can also have negative consequences such as discrimination, prejudice, economic impact, and humanitarian consequences. Therefore, when considering policies to reduce the number of foreigners entering a country, it is important to weigh the potential benefits against the potential consequences and to consider alternative solutions that may be less restrictive.",1

The Swedish monarchy is one of the oldest in the world, with a history dating back over a thousand years. It has played an important role in shaping the cultural identity of Sweden and has been a symbol of continuity and stability throughout the country's history. The Royal Family is also deeply intertwined with Swedish culture and tradition, and they participate in many public events, ceremonies and cultural celebrations that give the country a sense of continuity and tradition.

Just like Hollywood stars, the Swedish royal family also plays an important role in promoting the country's image and culture to the world. The royal family has a significant public presence, and they are often seen at international events, representing Sweden. They are also ambassadors for various charitable organizations and causes, and they have a strong influence on promoting Sweden as a tourist destination.

In addition, the monarchy also plays a role in preserving the country's history and cultural heritage. The Royal Palace in Stockholm, for example, is a popular tourist attraction and a symbol of Sweden's rich cultural heritage. The palace is also used for important state occasions and ceremonies, such as the opening of the Riksdag, the Swedish parliament.

On the other hand, Hollywood stars play an important role in shaping the cultural identity and image of America, as well as the entertainment industry. They are widely recognized and admired for their talent and contributions to the film industry, and they have a significant influence on popular culture. Hollywood stars are also often seen as role models, and they have a strong influence on fashion and style.

Just like the Swedish monarchy, Hollywood stars also play an important role in promoting the country's image and culture to the world.

362,0122.a2.txt,Swedish schools have an unjust grading system.,"The grading system in Swedish schools has been a topic of much debate in recent years, with many arguing that it is unjust and does not accurately reflect the abilities of students. In this essay, we will explore some of the reasons why the grading system in Swedish schools is unjust and the potential consequences of this unjust system.

One of the main reasons why the grading system in Swedish schools is unjust is that it relies heavily on standardized tests. These tests are often viewed as an unreliable measure of a student's knowledge and abilities, as they do not take into account the unique strengths and weaknesses of each individual student. Additionally, these tests are often not aligned with the curriculum and do not accurately measure what students have learned in the classroom.

Another reason why the grading system in Swedish schools is unjust is that it puts a significant amount of pressure on students. The emphasis on grades and test scores can lead to students feeling overwhelmed and stressed, which can negatively impact their mental and physical health. Additionally, the pressure to perform well on standardized tests can also lead to cheating and a lack of motivation to learn.

The grading system in Swedish schools is also unjust because it does not take into account the socioeconomic background of students. Research has shown that students from low-income families tend to perform worse on standardized tests than their more affluent peers. This is often due to a lack of resources, such as access to quality education and adequate support at home. The grading system in Swedish schools does not account for these inequalities and can perpetuate them.

Furthermore, the grading system in Swedish schools is unjust because it does not allow for individualized instruction. The emphasis on standardized tests and grades can lead to a one-size-fits-all approach to education, which can be detrimental to students who learn differently. Additionally, the grading system in Swedish schools can lead to a lack of creativity and critical thinking, as students are not encouraged to think outside the box and explore different perspectives.

The consequences of this unjust grading system in Swedish schools are far-reaching and can have a negative impact on students, teachers, and society as a whole. For students, the consequences can include poor mental and physical health, a lack of motivation to learn, and a lack of opportunities for success in the future. For teachers, the consequences can include a lack of autonomy in the classroom and a lack of creativity in their teaching methods. Additionally, for society as a whole, the consequences can include a lack of creativity and critical thinking, as well as a lack of opportunities for success for students from low-income families.

In conclusion, the grading system in Swedish schools is unjust and does not accurately reflect the abilities of students. It relies heavily on standardized tests, puts a significant amount of pressure on students, does not take into account the socioeconomic background of students, and does not allow for individualized instruction. The consequences of this unjust system are far-reaching and can have a negative impact on students, teachers, and society as a whole. It is important that the grading system in Swedish schools is reevaluated and reformed to ensure that it is fair, accurate, and promotes the success of all students.",1
363,0125.a2.txt,Why don't you have your parents living with you,"Living with one's parents as an adult can be viewed as unconventional, but there are several reasons why it can be beneficial for both the adult and the parents. In this essay, we will explore some of the reasons why adults should consider living with their parents.

One of the main reasons for adults to live with their parents is to provide financial stability. The cost of living, especially housing, has risen significantly in recent years, making it difficult for many adults to afford to live on their own. Living with one's parents can help reduce these costs and allow adults to save money for their future. Additionally, living with parents can also provide adults with the opportunity to pay off any outstanding debts or loans more quickly.

Another reason for adults to live with their parents is to provide emotional and practical support. Parents are often a source of love and support for their adult children, and living with them can provide adults with a sense of security and belonging. Additionally, living with parents can also provide practical support, such as help with household chores and running errands, that can make life easier for the adult.

Living with parents can also be beneficial for the elderly parents. As parents age, they may require additional care and support. Living with adult children can provide them with the companionship, security and help they need. It can also help prevent isolation and loneliness that can occur when parents live alone.

Furthermore, living with parents can also provide adults with the opportunity to strengthen their relationship with their parents. As adults, they can learn more about their parents' life experiences and perspectives, and gain a deeper understanding of their family's history and culture. Additionally, living with parents can also provide adults with the opportunity to bond with their parents over shared interests and activities.

Additionally, living with parents can also be beneficial for the environment. When adult children live with their parents, they are able to share resources such as cars and appliances, which can reduce their environmental footprint. Furthermore, living in a multigenerational household can also be beneficial for energy consumption, as it allows for sharing of energy costs and resources.

However, living with parents may not be suitable for everyone, it is important for both adults and parents to have open and honest communication about the decision to live together. Both adults and parents should establish clear boundaries and respect each other's privacy and independence. Additionally, it is important for adults to be mindful of their parents' needs and to be willing to help out with household chores and other responsibilities.

In conclusion, there are many reasons why adults should consider living with their parents. It can provide financial stability, emotional and practical support, strengthen relationships, and be beneficial for the environment. However, it is important for both adults and parents to have open and honest communication and establish clear boundaries. Living with parents can be a positive experience for everyone involved and can help adults and parents navigate the challenges of adulthood.",1
364,0127.a2.txt,Humans need to stop eating anonymous meat and dying their petpoodles pink.,"Eating meat and dyeing pet's fur are both controversial practices that have significant impacts on the environment, animals, and human health. In this essay, we will explore some of the reasons why humans need to stop consuming meat and dyeing their pets' fur, and the potential consequences of continuing these practices.

One of the main reasons for stopping the consumption of meat is its environmental impact. Animal agriculture is a significant contributor to deforestation, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. It requires large amounts of land, water, and resources to raise and transport animals, which can lead to the destruction of natural habitats and the displacement of native wildlife. Additionally, the production of meat also contributes to the emission of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming.

Another reason for stopping the consumption of meat is its impact on human health. Eating a diet high in red and processed meats is linked to an increased risk of heart disease, cancer, and other chronic diseases. Additionally, meat production also contributes to the spread of foodborne illnesses and the overuse of antibiotics in animal agriculture, which can lead to antibiotic resistance in humans.

In addition to the reasons above, dyeing pets' fur is also harmful to the animals. Dyeing a pet's fur involves using chemicals that can be toxic to the animal and can cause skin irritation, allergic reactions, and even respiratory problems. Additionally, the process of dyeing a pet's fur can also be stressful for the animal and can cause long-term harm.

Another reason for stopping the dyeing of pets' fur is that it is not necessary. Pets have their natural coat, which is designed to protect them from the elements, and dyeing their fur can change the way they feel, smell and even behave. Additionally, it can also change the way they are perceived by other animals, which can lead to social problems.

Furthermore, continuing to eat meat and dye pets' fur can also contribute to the commodification and exploitation of animals. The meat industry views animals as a commodity to be used for human consumption, and the practice of dyeing pets' fur can also be seen as a form of objectifying and exploiting animals for human pleasure.

The consequences of continuing these practices are far-reaching and can have a negative impact on the environment, animals, and human health. For the environment, the consequences can include deforestation, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. For animals, the consequences can include harm, stress, and exploitation. For humans, the consequences can include an increased risk of chronic diseases, foodborne illnesses, and antibiotic resistance.

In conclusion, humans need to stop eating meat and dyeing their pets' fur to reduce the environmental impact, protect animal welfare, and improve human health. These practices are not necessary and can lead to significant harm to the environment, animals, and human health. Instead, humans should consider adopting a plant-based diet and to respect the natural appearance of their pets. It is important for individuals to be mindful of the impact their actions have on the environment, animals and their own health, and to make informed choices that align with their values and beliefs.",1

The Swedish monarchy is a constitutional monarchy, where the monarch serves as the head of state and has limited powers, with the main function of representing the country. In this essay, we will explore the history, role, and significance of the Swedish monarchy.

The history of the Swedish monarchy dates back to the Viking age, where the country was ruled by a system of petty kingdoms. In the late 13th century, the Swedish monarchy was established under King Magnus Ladulås. Throughout the centuries, the Swedish monarchy has undergone significant changes, including the shift from absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy in the late 19th century. Today, the Swedish monarchy is a popular institution that serves as a symbol of continuity and stability.

The role of the Swedish monarchy is primarily ceremonial, with the main function of representing the country at home and abroad. The monarch also serves as a symbol of national unity and acts as a focus for national pride and identity. Additionally, the monarch also has a role in the Swedish government, as they formally appoint the Prime Minister and other government officials, and they also open and close the Riksdag, the Swedish parliament.

366,0130.a2.txt,The Preservation of Wolves - a critical issue,"Wolves are an important species in the ecosystem, playing a crucial role in maintaining a balance in the food chain and preserving biodiversity. However, human activities, such as hunting and habitat destruction, have led to a decline in the population of wolves worldwide. In this essay, we will explore the importance of preserving wolves and the measures that can be taken to protect them.

One of the main reasons why wolves need to be preserved is that they play an important role in maintaining a balance in the food chain. Wolves are apex predators and their presence helps to control the population of herbivores, such as deer and elk, which in turn helps to prevent overgrazing and preserve vegetation. Additionally, wolves also help to control the population of smaller predators, such as coyotes, which can help to protect smaller animals and birds.

Another reason why wolves need to be preserved is that they play a crucial role in preserving biodiversity. Wolves play a key role in shaping the structure of ecosystems and their absence can lead to a decline in biodiversity. For example, the decline of wolves in Yellowstone National Park led to an increase in the population of elk, which in turn led to a decline in the population of beavers, as the elk ate the willows that the beavers depended on.

Additionally, wolves have cultural and spiritual significance for many indigenous people. Many indigenous communities have a deep connection with wolves and see them as a symbol of strength, power, and resilience. Preserving wolves is crucial to maintaining the cultural heritage of these communities and recognizing their spiritual connection to the natural world.

However, human activities such as hunting and habitat destruction have led to a decline in the population of wolves worldwide. In order to preserve wolves, it is important to protect their habitats and to ensure that hunting and trapping of wolves is regulated and sustainable. This can be done through measures such as setting up protected areas for wolves, implementing hunting quotas, and enforcing laws against illegal hunting and trapping.

Another important measure to preserve wolves is to educate the public about the importance of wolves in the ecosystem and to dispel myths and misconceptions about them. Many people fear wolves and see them as a threat to human safety, but in reality, the risk of being attacked by a wolf is extremely low. By educating the public about the importance of wolves, we can help to reduce fear and misunderstanding, and increase support for conservation efforts.

Furthermore, it is also important to collaborate with local communities and organizations to ensure that conservation efforts are sustainable and take into account the needs and concerns of local people. This can be done through measures such as involving local communities in conservation efforts, supporting sustainable livelihoods, and addressing conflicts between wolves and human activities.

In conclusion, preserving wolves is crucial for maintaining a balance in the food chain and preserving biodiversity, as well as for their cultural and spiritual significance for many indigenous people. Human activities such as hunting and habitat destruction have led to a decline in the population of wolves worldwide, but there are measures that can be taken to protect them, such as protecting their habitats, regulating hunting, educating the public, and collaborating with local communities. It is important to take action to preserve wolves and to ensure that they continue to play a vital role in the ecosystem for generations to come.",1
367,0131.a2.txt,ALLOW BASEBALL CAPS IN THE CLASSROOM,"Baseball caps are a popular accessory worn by many individuals, but they are often viewed as a distraction in the classroom and are banned in many schools. However, in this essay, we will explore the reasons why baseball caps should be allowed in the classroom and the potential benefits they can bring to students.

One of the main reasons why baseball caps should be allowed in the classroom is that they can serve as a form of self-expression. Baseball caps can be a way for students to express their individuality and personal style, which can be important for their self-esteem and self-confidence. Additionally, baseball caps can also serve as a symbol of cultural or community identity, which can be important for many students.

Another reason why baseball caps should be allowed in the classroom is that they can serve as a practical tool. Baseball caps can be worn to protect the wearer from the sun and to keep their head warm in cold weather. Additionally, baseball caps can also be worn to conceal a bad hair day, which can be important for students who may feel self-conscious about their appearance.

Furthermore, baseball caps can also serve as a form of support or motivation for students. For example, a student who is a fan of a specific team can wear a baseball cap with the team's logo on it, which can serve as a form of motivation and inspiration for them. Additionally, baseball caps can also be worn to show support for a specific cause or organization, which can be important for students who want to make a difference in their community.

Additionally, allowing baseball caps in the classroom can also foster a positive and inclusive learning environment. By allowing students to wear baseball caps, schools can create an environment where students feel comfortable and respected, regardless of their personal style or cultural background. Furthermore, this can also help to create a sense of community and belonging among students, which can be important for their mental health and well-being.

However, it is important to note that baseball caps should be worn in a respectful and appropriate manner. This means that baseball caps should be worn with the brim facing forward and not worn in a way that can be seen as a distraction or disruptive to the learning environment. Additionally, baseball caps should not be worn with offensive or derogatory slogans or logos, which can be disrespectful to others.

In conclusion, baseball caps should be allowed in the classroom as they can serve as a form of self-expression, practical tool, support, and motivation for students. Additionally, allowing baseball caps in the classroom can foster a positive and inclusive learning environment, where students feel comfortable and respected, regardless of their personal style or cultural background. However, it is important that baseball caps are worn in a respectful and appropriate manner, which means that they should be worn with the brim facing forward, not worn in a way that can be seen as a distraction or disruptive to the learning environment, and not worn with offensive or derogatory slogans or logos.",1

These cars are often seen as a status symbol and a representation of wealth and success. In this essay, we will explore the reasons why new big, shiny, and powerful cars are considered better and the potential benefits they can bring to individuals.

One of the main reasons why new big, shiny, and powerful cars are considered better is that they provide a sense of luxury and comfort. These cars often come with a range of high-end features, such as leather seats, advanced infotainment systems, and powerful engines, which can make the driving experience more enjoyable and comfortable. Additionally, these cars often have a sleek and stylish design, which can make them more visually appealing and attractive.

Another reason why new big, shiny, and powerful cars are considered better is that they provide a sense of power and status. These cars are often seen as a symbol of wealth and success, and owning one can be seen as a way to showcase one's status and achievements. Additionally, the powerful engine and high-performance of these cars can also provide a sense of power and control, which can be appealing to many individuals.

Furthermore, new big, shiny, and powerful cars can also be more reliable and efficient than older models. These cars often come with the latest technology and features, which can make them more reliable and efficient than older models.

369,0134.a2.txt,Monarchy - obsolete in a democratic society,"The Swedish monarchy is one of the oldest in the world, with a history dating back over a thousand years. However, in a democratic society, many argue that the monarchy is obsolete and that it serves little purpose in modern times. In this essay, we will explore some of the reasons why the Swedish monarchy is considered obsolete in a democratic society and the potential drawbacks of maintaining the institution.

One of the main reasons why the Swedish monarchy is considered obsolete in a democratic society is that it represents an outdated system of government. In a democratic society, power is supposed to lie with the people, and they are the ones who choose their leaders through free and fair elections. The monarchy, however, is an inherited position, and the monarch's powers are limited and mostly ceremonial. This means that the monarchy does not have a significant role in the day-to-day governance of the country and does not reflect the principles of democracy.

Another reason why the Swedish monarchy is considered obsolete in a democratic society is that it is a costly institution to maintain. The monarchy requires significant resources, including funding for the royal family, their staff, and the maintenance of their palaces and other properties. These resources could be better used for other public services such as healthcare, education, and social welfare. Additionally, the monarchy also requires significant resources for security and protection, which could also be better used for other public services.

Furthermore, the monarchy is also considered to be an outdated symbol of privilege and inequality. In a democratic society, everyone is supposed to be equal and have the same rights and opportunities. However, the monarchy represents a system where certain individuals are born into privilege and power, while others are not. This can be seen as a symbol of inequality and can be divisive in a society that values equality and fairness.

Moreover, many argue that the Swedish monarchy is no longer necessary for national unity and identity. In a democratic society, national unity and identity are supposed to be based on shared values, beliefs, and institutions. However, the monarchy is seen as a symbol of the past, and it does not reflect the diversity and complexity of modern society. Additionally, the monarchy can also be seen as divisive, as it can be associated with certain groups or regions and can be seen as a symbol of privilege and inequality.

In conclusion, the Swedish monarchy is considered obsolete in a democratic society due to its outdated system of government, its costliness, its representation of privilege and inequality, and its lack of necessity for national unity and identity. In a democratic society, power should lie with the people, and they should have the right to choose their leaders through free and fair elections. The Swedish monarchy is an inherited position, and its powers are limited and mostly ceremonial, which does not reflect the principles of democracy. Additionally, it is costly and can be seen as divisive. Therefore, it is important for society to consider if the maintenance of the monarchy is worth the cost and if it aligns with the principles of democracy, equality and fairness.",1
370,0135.a2.txt,Racism,"Racism is a deeply ingrained and pervasive problem that has affected societies throughout history. It is defined as the belief that certain races are inherently superior or inferior to others, and it often leads to discriminatory and oppressive behaviors towards individuals based on their race. The quote by Timothy Findley, ""Like tribalism, fundamentalism, homophobia and all the other shallow responses of one person to another, racism concentrates on ""what"" you are, and ignores ""who"" you are,"" highlights the destructive and superficial nature of racism. In this essay, we will explore the quote further and discuss the ways in which racism concentrates on ""what"" individuals are and ignores ""who"" they are.

The first way in which racism concentrates on ""what"" individuals are is by focusing on their physical characteristics and ethnic background. Racism is often based on the belief that certain races are inherently different from others, and that these differences are the basis for discrimination and oppression. This means that individuals are judged and treated differently based on their race, rather than their individual qualities, abilities, and actions. This is a shallow and superficial way of looking at individuals, as it ignores the complexities and nuances of their identity and experiences.

Another way in which racism concentrates on ""what"" individuals are is by assuming that their race determines their behavior, values, and abilities. Racism often involves the stereotyping and generalizing of individuals based on their race, which can lead to false assumptions about their behavior, values, and abilities. This can lead to discrimination and prejudice, as individuals are not judged on their own merits, but on the stereotypes associated with their race.

Furthermore, racism concentrates on ""what"" individuals are by ignoring ""who"" they are. Racism focuses on the external characteristics of individuals, such as their race, rather than their internal qualities, such as their character, personality, and experiences. This means that individuals are not seen as unique and complex individuals, but as members of a certain group, which can lead to dehumanization and oppression.

Additionally, racism also ignores the fact that individuals are not just one ""what"" but they are complex individuals with multiple identities. Racism's narrow focus on race ignores the fact that individuals have many different identities, such as their gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and religion. It doesn't take into account that these multiple identities may intersect and create unique experiences and perspectives.

Racism also ignores the fact that individuals are not defined by their race, and that their race is just one aspect of their identity. Racism reinforces the idea that race is the most important aspect of an individual's identity, and that it determines their behavior, values, and abilities. This ignores the fact that individuals are complex and unique, and that their race is just one aspect of who they are.

In conclusion, racism is a destructive and superficial problem that concentrates on ""what"" individuals are and ignores ""who""",1
371,0136.a2.txt,Our Elderly Deserve Qualified Care,"As people age, they often require additional care and support to maintain their health and well-being. The elderly population is a diverse group with different needs and preferences, and it's essential that they receive qualified care that is tailored to their individual needs. In this essay, we will explore the reasons why the elderly deserve qualified care and the potential benefits of providing such care.

One of the main reasons why the elderly deserve qualified care is that they are more vulnerable to health problems and chronic conditions. As people age, their bodies become more susceptible to illness and injury, and they often require specialized care to manage their conditions. Qualified care providers, such as doctors, nurses, and therapists, are trained to understand the specific needs of the elderly population and can provide the necessary care and support to help them maintain their health and well-being.

Another reason why the elderly deserve qualified care is that they often require assistance with daily activities. As people age, they may lose the ability to perform certain tasks, such as bathing, dressing, and cooking, which can make it difficult for them to live independently. Qualified care providers, such as home health aides, can provide the necessary assistance to help the elderly maintain their independence and continue to live in their own homes.

Furthermore, the elderly also deserve qualified care because they often experience feelings of isolation and loneliness. As people age, they may lose friends and family members, and they may find it difficult to maintain social connections. Qualified care providers can provide the necessary support and companionship to help the elderly maintain their social connections and improve their mental and emotional well-being.

Additionally, providing qualified care to the elderly is essential for their overall health and well-being. Qualified care providers are trained to understand the specific needs of the elderly population and can provide the necessary care and support to help them maintain their health and well-being. This can include monitoring their health, administering medication, and providing physical therapy and rehabilitation services.

However, it is important to note that providing qualified care to the elderly can be challenging and costly. Many countries face the challenge of an aging population, and the demand for qualified care providers is increasing, which can make it difficult to provide the necessary care and support to the elderly population. Additionally, providing qualified care can be costly and may not be affordable for all individuals.

In conclusion, the elderly deserve qualified care because they are more vulnerable to health problems and chronic conditions, they often require assistance with daily activities, they experience feelings of isolation and loneliness and providing qualified care is essential for their overall health and well-being. Qualified care providers, such as doctors, nurses, and therapists",1
372,0137.a2.txt,Euthanasia - A Human Right,"Euthanasia, also known as physician-assisted suicide, is the practice of intentionally ending the life of a person who is suffering from an incurable illness or condition. The debate over whether euthanasia should be considered a human right has been ongoing for many years, with supporters arguing that it gives individuals the right to die with dignity and opponents arguing that it goes against the sanctity of life. In this essay, we will explore the arguments for why euthanasia should be considered a human right and the potential benefits it can bring to individuals.

One of the main arguments for why euthanasia should be considered a human right is that it gives individuals the right to die with dignity. Many individuals who are suffering from incurable illnesses or conditions experience a significant decline in their quality of life, and they may wish to end their suffering. Euthanasia gives these individuals the right to make the decision to end their lives in a peaceful and dignified manner, rather than being forced to endure a prolonged and painful death.

Another argument for why euthanasia should be considered a human right is that it allows individuals to have control over their own lives. Many individuals who are suffering from incurable illnesses or conditions feel that they have lost control over their lives and are at the mercy of their illness. Euthanasia gives these individuals the ability to make the decision to end their lives on their own terms and regain control over their lives.

Furthermore, euthanasia can also bring emotional relief to the patient's family members and loved ones. Watching a loved one suffer from an incurable illness or condition can be emotionally taxing and can cause mental health problems like depression and anxiety. Euthanasia allows the patient to die with dignity and can also provide emotional relief to their loved ones who no longer have to watch them suffer.

Additionally, legalizing euthanasia also allows for better regulation and control over the process, ensuring that it is only carried out in specific circumstances and with proper oversight. This can prevent the possibility of abuse or misuse of the practice and ensure that it is only used for individuals who are suffering from incurable illnesses or conditions.

However, it is important to note that there are also valid arguments against euthanasia being considered as a human right. Some argue that it goes against the sanctity of life and that every human life is valuable and should be protected. Additionally, it may also be argued that euthanasia can be misused or abused by individuals or institutions, and that it could be used as a means of eliminating the lives of certain groups of people.

In conclusion, euthanasia, also known as physician-assisted suicide, is the practice of intentionally ending the life of a person who is suffering from an incurable illness or condition. It should be considered a human right because it gives individuals the right to die with dignity, allows individuals to have control over their own lives, brings emotional relief to the patient's family members and loved ones and allows for better regulation and control over the process. It's important for society to have a dialogue about the ethical and moral implications of euthanasia and weigh the pros and cons before making a decision.",1
373,0138.a2.txt,The state doesn't support families to take care of they're elderly.,"The responsibility of taking care of the elderly often falls on the shoulders of families, but in many cases, the government does not provide adequate support to make this task easier. The lack of support can lead to financial strain, emotional stress, and difficulties in providing the necessary care for the elderly. In this essay, we will explore the reasons why the government should provide more support to families who are taking care of their elderly and the potential benefits it can bring to both the elderly and their families.

One of the main reasons why the government should provide more support to families taking care of their elderly is that it can help alleviate financial strain. Many families struggle to afford the cost of care for the elderly, which can include medical expenses, home care, and other costs associated with providing the necessary care. The government can provide financial assistance to help families cover these costs and make it easier for them to provide the necessary care for the elderly.

Another reason why the government should provide more support to families taking care of their elderly is that it can help alleviate emotional stress. Caring for the elderly can be a demanding and emotional task, and many families feel overwhelmed and stressed by the responsibility. The government can provide support services such as counseling, respite care, and emotional support to help families cope with the emotional stress of caring for the elderly.

Furthermore, providing support to families taking care of their elderly can also improve the quality of care for the elderly. When families have access to the necessary resources, they are better able to provide the necessary care for the elderly, which can improve their quality of life and overall well-being. Additionally, it can also help reduce the risk of elder abuse and neglect.

Additionally, providing support to families taking care of their elderly can also help reduce the burden on the healthcare system. When the elderly receive the necessary care at home, they are less likely to require hospitalization or long-term care, which can be costly to the healthcare system. The government can provide support to families in order to reduce the burden on the healthcare system and ensure that the elderly receive the necessary care.

However, it is important to note that providing support to families taking care of their elderly can be costly for the government. Many governments face budget constraints, and there may be limited resources to provide the necessary support. Additionally, it can be difficult to determine who should receive support and how much support should be provided.

In conclusion, the government should provide more support to families taking care of their elderly because it can help alleviate financial strain, emotional stress, improve the quality of care, reduce the risk of elder abuse and neglect, and help reduce the burden on the healthcare system. However, it is important to consider the potential costs and challenges associated with providing this support and to ensure that the support provided is effective and equitably distributed. It is important",1
374,0139.a2.txt,Homosexuals should be allowed to adopt children,"The issue of whether or not homosexuals should be allowed to adopt children has been the subject of much debate and controversy. Supporters argue that homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals to adopt children and that sexual orientation should not be a determining factor in the adoption process. Opponents argue that children are better off with heterosexual parents and that allowing homosexuals to adopt may have negative effects on the children. In this essay, we will explore the reasons why homosexuals should be allowed to adopt children and the potential benefits it can bring to both the children and the adoptive parents.

One of the main reasons why homosexuals should be allowed to adopt children is that sexual orientation should not be a determining factor in the adoption process. Adoption is about providing a loving and stable home for a child, and sexual orientation should not be used as a barrier to prevent individuals from adopting. Allowing homosexuals to adopt children promotes equality and fairness, and it ensures that children are placed in homes that are best suited to meet their needs.

Another reason why homosexuals should be allowed to adopt children is that research has shown that children raised by homosexual parents are just as well-adjusted as children raised by heterosexual parents. Studies have found that children raised by homosexual parents do not experience any negative effects on their psychological, social, or emotional well-being. This means that children will not be negatively impacted by being raised by homosexual parents and that it will not affect their development in a negative way.

Furthermore, allowing homosexuals to adopt children can also help to address the problem of children in need of homes. There are many children in the foster care system and other forms of institutional care who are in need of loving and stable homes. Allowing homosexuals to adopt children can help to provide these children with the loving homes they need, and it can also help to reduce the number of children in the foster care system.

Additionally, allowing homosexuals to adopt children can also help to increase the number of potential adoptive parents. Not allowing homosexuals to adopt children can limit the number of potential adoptive parents, and it can make it more difficult to find homes for children in need. By allowing homosexuals to adopt children, it opens up a larger pool of potential adoptive parents, which can help to ensure that children are placed in homes that are best suited to meet their needs.

However, it is important to note that not all homosexuals may be suitable to adopt children. Just as with heterosexuals, the screening process should be thorough and should evaluate the individual's ability to provide a loving and stable home for a child. Additionally, some may argue that children may face discrimination and bullying because of their parent's sexual orientation, and it could also affect the child's ability to form a healthy sense of identity.

In conclusion, homosexuals should be allowed to adopt children because sexual orientation should not be a",1
375,0140.a2.txt,High schools in Sweden need discipline!,"High schools in Sweden, like in any other country, play a crucial role in the education and development of young people. High schools provide students with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in life, and they also play an important role in shaping their values and attitudes. However, many high schools in Sweden have been facing challenges in maintaining discipline among students. In this essay, we will explore the reasons why high schools in Sweden need discipline and the potential benefits of implementing stricter discipline policies.

One of the main reasons why high schools in Sweden need discipline is that it creates a safe and secure learning environment for students. Discipline helps to ensure that students are aware of the boundaries and expectations, and it can help to prevent disruptions and distractions in the classroom. This can create a more positive and productive learning environment, which can benefit all students.

Another reason why high schools in Sweden need discipline is that it helps to promote respect and responsibility among students. Discipline helps to teach students the importance of following rules and respecting authority, which can help them to develop the skills they need to be successful in life. Additionally, discipline can also help to promote responsibility among students, as they learn to take responsibility for their actions and the consequences that follow.

Furthermore, discipline can also help to improve academic performance among students. When students are aware of the boundaries and expectations, they are more likely to focus on their studies and achieve academic success. This can be beneficial not only for the students but also for the society as a whole since it can help to produce well-educated and productive citizens.

Additionally, discipline can also help to prepare students for the future. High school is not only a place for learning but also a place for personal development and socialization. Discipline can help students to develop the skills they need to succeed in life, such as time management, decision-making, and problem-solving. This can be beneficial not only for the students but also for the society as a whole, as it can help to produce well-educated and productive citizens.

However, it is important to note that implementing stricter discipline policies can also have negative effects. Some argue that strict discipline policies can create a negative and oppressive learning environment, and it can also discourage students from expressing themselves and participating in class discussions. Additionally, strict discipline policies can also lead to increased stress and anxiety among students, which can negatively affect their mental and emotional well-being.

In conclusion, high schools in Sweden need discipline because it creates a safe and secure learning environment, promotes respect and responsibility, improves academic performance, and prepares students for the future. However, it's important to strike a balance between discipline and creating a positive learning environment that encourages participation and creativity. It's important for schools to have a comprehensive and well-thought-out discipline policy that takes into account the needs of all students and promotes positive behavior while addressing disruptive behavior.",1
376,0142.a2.txt,Do our living standards require that the state looks after the elderly people?,"As our population ages, the question of how best to care for the elderly becomes increasingly important. One of the options that has been proposed is that the state should take a more active role in looking after the elderly. Supporters argue that our current living standards require that the state provides comprehensive care for the elderly, while opponents argue that this is an unnecessary burden on the state and that the elderly should be cared for by their families or private institutions. In this essay, we will explore the reasons why our living standards require that the state looks after the elderly and the potential benefits of such a system.

One of the main reasons why our living standards require that the state looks after the elderly is that the elderly population is increasing, and there may not be enough family members or private institutions to provide care for all of them. As the population ages, there will be more and more elderly individuals who require care, and the state will need to step in to ensure that everyone has access to the care they need.

Another reason why our living standards require that the state looks after the elderly is that the cost of care can be prohibitively expensive for many families. Many families may not be able to afford the cost of long-term care for the elderly, and the state will need to provide financial assistance to help cover these costs. Additionally, elderly individuals may not have the financial resources to pay for private care, and the state will need to provide them with financial assistance.

Furthermore, our living standards require that the state looks after the elderly as it can ensure that the elderly receive the highest quality of care. The state can provide oversight and regulation of care facilities to ensure that they meet the highest standards of care. Additionally, the state can also provide training and resources to care providers to ensure that they are able to provide the highest quality of care.

Additionally, providing care for the elderly is a collective responsibility of the society, and it's not something that should be left to the families alone. The state has a responsibility to ensure that all citizens have access to the care they need, regardless of their financial resources or family situation. By taking a more active role in caring for the elderly, the state can help to ensure that the elderly are able to live their lives with dignity and respect.

However, it is important to note that there are also valid arguments against the state taking a more active role in looking after the elderly. Some argue that it is an unnecessary burden on the state and that the elderly should be cared for by their families or private institutions. Additionally, there are also concerns that the state may not be able to provide the same level of care as families or private institutions, and that it may lead to a lack of personalization and autonomy for the elderly.

It is a complex and emotional process that can have a positive impact on the lives of both the adopted child and the adoptive parents. The reasons for adoption vary and can include infertility, a desire to provide a loving home for a child, and the need to build a family. In this essay, we will explore the different types of adoption, the benefits and challenges of adoption, and the current adoption policies and practices in different countries.

There are several types of adoption, including domestic adoption, international adoption, foster care adoption, and open adoption. Domestic adoption refers to the adoption of a child within the same country, while international adoption refers to the adoption of a child from another country. Foster care adoption refers to the adoption of a child who is currently in the foster care system, and open adoption refers to an adoption where there is ongoing contact between the birth and adoptive families.

Adoption can have many benefits for both the adopted child and the adoptive parents. For the child, adoption can provide a loving and stable home, access to education and healthcare, and the opportunity to grow up in a supportive family environment. For the adoptive parents, adoption can provide the opportunity to build a family, fulfill their desire to have children, and give them the opportunity to make a positive impact on a child's life.

However, adoption can also be a challenging process. There can be a significant emotional toll on both the adopted child and the adoptive parents, as they navigate the complexities of building a new family relationship. Additionally, there may also be legal and financial challenges associated with the adoption process, and the adopted child may struggle with feelings of loss and identity.

Adoption policies and practices vary between different countries. In some countries, such as the United States, the adoption process is relatively straightforward, and there is a large pool of children available for adoption. In other countries, such as China, the adoption process is more complex, and there are strict guidelines and regulations that must be followed. Additionally, some countries have a preference for domestic adoption, while others may prioritize international adoption.

In conclusion, adoption is a complex and emotional process that can have a positive impact on the lives of both the adopted child and the adoptive parents. There are several types of adoption, including domestic adoption, international adoption, foster care adoption, and open adoption.

378,0146.a2.txt,Youths need motivation,"Motivation is a crucial element in the development of young people. It is the driving force that helps them to set goals, overcome obstacles, and achieve success. Without motivation, young people may struggle to find purpose and direction in their lives, and they may be less likely to reach their full potential. In this essay, we will explore the reasons why youth needs motivation, the different types of motivation, and the ways in which parents, educators, and society can support and promote motivation in young people.

One of the main reasons why youth needs motivation is that it provides them with a sense of purpose and direction. When young people are motivated, they are more likely to set goals and work towards achieving them. This can help them to develop a sense of self-worth and confidence, and it can also help them to feel in control of their own lives. Additionally, motivation can also help young people to develop a sense of meaning and significance in their lives.

Another reason why youth needs motivation is that it helps them to overcome obstacles and challenges. Motivated young people are more likely to persevere in the face of adversity and to find ways to overcome obstacles that may be standing in the way of their success. Additionally, motivation can also help young people to develop resilience and the ability to cope with stress and setbacks.

Furthermore, youth needs motivation as it can help them to achieve academic and career success. When young people are motivated, they are more likely to work hard and to achieve academic success. Additionally, motivation can also help them to develop the skills and qualifications they need to succeed in their chosen careers.

Additionally, motivation can also help young people to develop positive relationships and social connections. When young people are motivated, they are more likely to participate in extracurricular activities and to form positive relationships with their peers. This can help them to develop a sense of belonging and to feel connected to their community.

There are different types of motivation that can drive young people, such as intrinsic motivation, which comes from within the individual, and extrinsic motivation, which comes from external factors. Intrinsic motivation is driven by an individual's own interests and desires, while extrinsic motivation is driven by external rewards or pressures. Both forms of motivation can be important for young people's development, but intrinsic motivation is generally considered more sustainable and effective in promoting long-term success.

Parents, educators, and society can support and promote motivation in young people by creating an environment that is conducive to learning and growth. Parents can support their children's motivation by providing a safe and stable home environment, and by encouraging them to set goals and work towards achieving them. Educators can support and promote motivation by creating an engaging and challenging curriculum, and by providing opportunities for students to take on leadership roles and to participate in extracurricular activities.

One of the main advantages of duty-free shops is that they provide a way for travelers to save money on their purchases. When goods are sold in duty-free shops, they are exempt from certain taxes and tariffs, making them more affordable for consumers. This is particularly beneficial for travelers from high-tax countries, who can save a significant amount of money on purchases such as alcohol, tobacco, and luxury items.

In addition to the financial benefits for travelers, duty-free shops also provide a boost for the local economy. By offering a wide range of products at competitive prices, duty-free shops attract more tourists to the region. This leads to an increase in tourism revenue, as well as job creation in the retail and hospitality sectors. Duty-free shops also provide a platform for local businesses and manufacturers to showcase their products to a global audience.

Furthermore, duty-free shops also play a role in the preservation of cultural heritage. The Baltic Sea region is home to a rich cultural heritage, with many historical sites and landmarks. Duty-free shops provide an opportunity for local artisans and craftspeople to showcase and sell their traditional products to visitors, helping to preserve and promote the region's cultural heritage.

Another benefit of duty-free shops is that they can serve as a means of increasing regional cooperation and collaboration.

380,0149.a2.txt,Grants instead of loans to go to university,"Grants, unlike loans, are a form of financial aid that does not need to be repaid. They are awarded based on financial need and other factors such as academic merit. In this essay, we will discuss the benefits of grants as a means of financing higher education instead of loans.

One of the main benefits of grants is that they do not need to be repaid. This is a significant advantage for students who are already struggling to make ends meet. Repaying student loans can be a significant burden for many graduates, especially in a challenging job market. With loans, students are often required to start repaying them while still in school or soon after graduation, which can be a significant obstacle for those who are struggling to find employment.

Grants also provide an opportunity for students who would not otherwise be able to afford higher education to pursue their dreams. Many students come from low-income families and would not be able to afford the cost of tuition without financial aid. Grants can help to level the playing field and make higher education more accessible to all students, regardless of their financial background.

Moreover, grants can also help to increase the diversity of the student body. Students from underrepresented groups, such as minority students and first-generation college students, are often at a disadvantage when it comes to paying for higher education. Grants can help to reduce the financial barriers that these students face, making it more likely that they will be able to attend college and succeed.

Another advantage of grants is that they can be used to support specific academic programs or research projects. This can be beneficial for students who are pursuing fields of study that are not typically supported by loans, such as the arts or the humanities. It can also be useful for students who are engaged in research or other projects that are not covered by traditional financial aid programs.

In addition to the benefits for students, grants can also provide benefits for colleges and universities. When more students are able to attend college, institutions can increase their enrollment and revenue.

381,0150.a2.txt,We should not eat our friends.,"Eating meat has been a part of human culture for centuries, but in recent years, there has been growing concern about the environmental, ethical, and health implications of consuming animal products. In this essay, we will explore the reasons why we should not eat meat.

One of the main reasons why we should not eat meat is that it is bad for the environment. Animal agriculture is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, water pollution, and other forms of environmental degradation. According to the United Nations, animal agriculture is responsible for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the entire transportation sector. Additionally, the deforestation caused by clearing land for animal grazing and feed production is a major contributor to biodiversity loss and habitat destruction.

Another reason why we should not eat meat is that it is unethical. Animal welfare is a major concern in factory farming, where animals are often kept in overcrowded and inhumane conditions. Many animals are subjected to cruel practices such as debeaking, dehorning, and tail docking, without any pain relief. Additionally, the transportation and slaughter of animals for meat is often cruel and inhumane.

Furthermore, eating meat is bad for our health. Consuming animal products has been linked to a higher risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, and certain cancers. A diet high in red and processed meats has been classified as a group 1 carcinogen by the World Health Organization. Additionally, a plant-based diet has been shown to have numerous health benefits, including a lower risk of chronic diseases, improved digestion and weight management.

A plant-based diet can also have economic benefits. The production of plant-based foods require less land, water, and energy than animal agriculture. Additionally, plant-based foods are often cheaper than animal products. Making the switch to a plant-based diet can help to reduce the financial burden of food costs for individuals and families.

Additionally, there are alternative options to meat that can be delicious and satisfying. Plant-based alternatives such as tofu, tempeh, and seitan have become increasingly popular and are available in many supermarkets and restaurants. Additionally, many plant-based foods such as legumes, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables offer a wide range of flavors and textures that can be used to make delicious and satisfying meals.

In conclusion, there are many reasons why we should not eat meat. It is bad for the environment, unethical, bad for our health and has economic benefits. There are also alternative options to meat that can be delicious and satisfying. While it can be difficult to make changes to our diet and habits, the benefits of reducing or eliminating meat consumption are clear and significant. By making the switch to a plant-based diet, we can help to reduce our impact on the environment, improve our health and support ethical food production.",1
382,0155.a2.txt,More physical education at school,"Physical education (PE) is an essential aspect of a student's education, yet it is often overlooked or underfunded in schools. In this essay, we will discuss the importance of PE and the benefits of incorporating more physical education into the school curriculum.

First and foremost, physical education is crucial for the physical health and wellbeing of students. Regular exercise has been shown to improve cardiovascular health, strength and flexibility, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. PE classes provide an opportunity for students to engage in regular physical activity and develop healthy habits that can last a lifetime.

In addition to physical health benefits, PE also has mental health benefits. Regular exercise has been linked to improved mood, reduced stress and anxiety, and improved cognitive function. PE classes can provide a much-needed break from the academic demands of the school day, allowing students to release energy and recharge their mental batteries.

Furthermore, PE can also contribute to the overall development of students. PE classes teach important skills such as teamwork, communication, and leadership. These skills are transferable to other areas of life and can help to foster a sense of community and belonging in the school. PE can also help to promote self-esteem and self-confidence, which can have a positive impact on academic performance.

Another benefit of more physical education in schools is that it can increase academic performance. Studies have shown that regular physical activity can improve concentration, memory, and overall academic achievement. In addition, PE classes can provide a break from the academic demands of the school day, allowing students to return to class refreshed and ready to learn.

Furthermore, PE can provide opportunities for students to explore different sports and activities, and find something they enjoy and excel in. This can help to increase their motivation and engagement in school and lead to better academic performance.

Moreover, incorporating more physical education into the school curriculum can also have benefits for the school as a whole. PE classes can help to create a positive school culture and promote a sense of community among students, staff and parents. Physical education can also help to promote school spirit and pride, leading to better relationships between the school and the community.

However, it should be noted that there are some challenges to incorporating more physical education into the school curriculum. One of the main challenges is funding. Many schools struggle to provide adequate resources for PE classes, such as equipment, facilities, and qualified instructors. Additionally, some schools may prioritize other subjects over PE, leading to less time being allocated for physical education.

In conclusion, physical education is an essential aspect of a student's education and should be given more importance in schools. Regular physical activity can improve physical and mental health, overall development and academic performance. More physical education in schools can also foster a positive school culture and promote school spirit. While there are some challenges, it's important to work on providing the necessary resources for physical education and make it a priority in the curriculum.",1
383,0156.a2.txt,The DNA research must be regulated,"DNA research has the potential to revolutionize the way we understand and treat diseases, but it also poses significant ethical and societal challenges. In this essay, we will discuss why DNA research must be regulated in order to ensure its responsible and ethical use.

One of the main reasons for regulating DNA research is to protect the privacy and security of individuals. Genetic information is highly sensitive and personal, and it is important to ensure that it is not misused or abused. DNA research must be regulated to ensure that individuals' genetic information is collected, stored, and shared in a way that respects their privacy and autonomy. This includes regulations around informed consent, data security, and data sharing.

Another reason for regulating DNA research is to prevent discrimination and stigmatization. Genetic information can be used to discriminate against individuals in areas such as employment, health insurance, and other areas of life. Furthermore, if genetic information is not kept confidential, people may be stigmatized based on their genetic makeup. Regulations around DNA research must be in place to prevent discrimination and stigmatization based on genetic information.

Furthermore, regulating DNA research is necessary to ensure that it is conducted in an ethical manner. The rapid pace of genetic research has raised a number of ethical concerns, such as issues around genetic engineering and gene editing. Regulating DNA research can help to ensure that it is conducted in an ethical and responsible manner, and that it is not used for purposes that are harmful or unethical.

Moreover, regulation can also help to ensure that the benefits of DNA research are shared equitably. DNA research has the potential to improve the health and wellbeing of people around the world, but it is important to ensure that these benefits are shared equitably across different populations and communities. Regulating DNA research can help to ensure that it is conducted in a way that is inclusive and equitable, and that it does not perpetuate existing disparities or inequalities.

Additionally, regulations can also help to ensure that DNA research is conducted in a transparent manner. Regulations can establish guidelines for the conduct of DNA research, including requirements for transparency and public engagement.

384,0157.a2.txt,"Corridor or apartment, which is best?","When it comes to choosing a place to live, one must weigh the pros and cons of the different options available. Two popular options are corridors and apartments. In this essay, we will compare the two types of housing and discuss which one is best.

Corridor housing refers to a type of housing where residents share common areas such as hallways, stairways, and bathrooms. This type of housing is typically found in dormitories, boarding houses, and other forms of communal living. One of the main advantages of corridor housing is that it is often more affordable than apartments. Rent is typically lower and utility costs are shared, making it a more cost-effective option for many people. Additionally, corridor housing provides the opportunity to live in close proximity to others, which can be beneficial for social interaction and a sense of community.

On the other hand, apartments offer more privacy and autonomy. They typically come with their own kitchen and bathroom, and residents have more control over their living space. Apartments also offer more space, which can be beneficial for families or people who need more room to store their belongings. Additionally, apartments can come with amenities such as a gym, pool, or laundry facilities, which can be convenient and make it easier to maintain a comfortable lifestyle.

Moreover, apartments usually offer a more stable living environment, with long-term leases and the possibility to make changes to the interior. This can be beneficial for families with kids, as they can make the space feel more like a home. Additionally, apartments are usually located in more desirable areas such as central city locations, close to transportation and amenities.

Another advantage of apartments is that they offer more security. Many apartments come with security features such as locked entrances and security cameras, which can provide a sense of safety and peace of mind. Additionally, apartments are typically found in more established neighborhoods, which can be beneficial for people who want to live in a safe and stable community.

However, it should be noted that apartments can be more expensive than corridor housing. Rent and utility costs are typically higher, which can be a burden for people on a tight budget. Additionally, apartments can be harder to find, as they are in high demand and can be difficult to secure, especially in popular areas.

In conclusion, both corridor housing and apartments have their own advantages and disadvantages. Corridor housing is typically more affordable and provides the opportunity for social interaction and a sense of community. However, apartments offer more privacy, autonomy, and security. Additionally, apartments are typically located in more desirable areas and come with amenities that can make life more comfortable. Ultimately, the best choice depends on individual preferences and priorities. Factors such as cost, space, location, and lifestyle should be taken into consideration when choosing between corridor housing and apartments.",1
385,0158.a2.txt,Let's sleep!,"Sleeping is an essential part of life, yet many people do not fully understand the benefits it provides. In this essay, we will explore the various benefits of sleeping and why it is so important for our overall health and wellbeing.

One of the most obvious benefits of sleeping is that it helps to restore and rejuvenate the body. During sleep, the body is able to repair and regenerate cells and tissues, and to restore energy levels. Adequate sleep is necessary for the body to function properly, and a lack of sleep can lead to a host of health problems, such as a weakened immune system, decreased metabolism, and increased risk of chronic diseases.

Furthermore, sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining mental and emotional health. Sleep is essential for the brain to process and consolidate memories, and to regulate emotions. Studies have shown that lack of sleep can lead to a range of mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment. Additionally, adequate sleep can also help to improve mood, concentration, and overall cognitive function.

Another benefit of sleeping is that it can help to regulate appetite and maintain a healthy weight. Studies have shown that people who get adequate sleep are less likely to be overweight or obese, as sleep plays a role in regulating hormones that control appetite. Furthermore, lack of sleep can lead to increased cravings for high-calorie foods and reduced physical activity, which can contribute to weight gain.

Moreover, sleeping is important for maintaining a healthy immune system. During sleep, the body releases cytokines, which are chemicals that help to fight infection and inflammation. Additionally, sleep also boosts the production of white blood cells, which help to protect the body from pathogens and other harmful substances.

Additionally, sleep has been shown to have a positive impact on athletic performance. Adequate sleep is essential for physical recovery and repair, and can improve overall strength and endurance. Furthermore, lack of sleep can lead to decreased reaction time, decreased coordination, and a higher risk of injury.

386,0159.a2.txt,Shorter Business Hours for Shops!,"The traditional business hours for shops, which are typically from 9 am to 5 pm, have been in place for decades. However, in recent years, there has been a growing movement towards shorter business hours for shops. In this essay, we will discuss the benefits of shorter business hours for shops and why they should be implemented.

One of the main benefits of shorter business hours for shops is that it can improve the work-life balance of employees. Many retail employees are required to work long and irregular hours, which can be a significant strain on their personal and family lives. Shorter business hours can help to alleviate this strain by providing employees with more time to spend with their families and pursue other interests.

In addition, shorter business hours for shops can also lead to increased productivity and job satisfaction among employees. When employees are not overworked and exhausted, they are more likely to be engaged and motivated in their work. This can lead to increased productivity and job satisfaction, which can ultimately benefit the business.

Furthermore, shorter business hours can also be beneficial for customers. Many customers find it difficult to shop during traditional business hours, especially those who work during the day. Shorter business hours can make it more convenient for customers to shop, leading to increased foot traffic and sales for the business.

Another benefit of shorter business hours is that it can lead to a reduction in energy consumption and costs. When businesses are open for fewer hours, they use less energy, which can result in significant savings on electricity and heating bills.

When businesses are open for fewer hours, they generate less waste and pollution, which can have a positive impact on the environment. Additionally, when businesses are closed earlier, there is less traffic on the road, which can help to reduce emissions and improve air quality.

However, it should be noted that shorter business hours can also have drawbacks. One of the main drawbacks is that it can be difficult for businesses to adjust their operations",1
387,0161.a2.txt,Why Sweden need a state-controlled company for the sale of alcoholic beverages,"The sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages is a complex issue that is often regulated by governments in order to control the negative effects associated with excessive alcohol consumption. In Sweden, the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages is currently managed by a state-controlled company, Systembolaget. In this essay, we will discuss why Sweden needs a state-controlled company for the sale of alcoholic beverages.

One of the main reasons for having a state-controlled company for the sale of alcoholic beverages is to reduce the harm caused by excessive alcohol consumption. By having a state-controlled company, the government is able to regulate the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in a way that aims to reduce the negative effects associated with excessive alcohol consumption, such as addiction, crime, and health problems.

Additionally, a state-controlled company can help to prevent under-age drinking by ensuring that alcoholic beverages are not sold to minors. Systembolaget, the state-controlled company in Sweden, has strict rules regarding the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors, which helps to prevent under-age drinking and its associated negative effects.

Furthermore, a state-controlled company can also help to ensure that the quality and safety of alcoholic beverages are maintained. Systembolaget has strict rules and regulations for the products it sells, ensuring that only safe and high-quality products are available for purchase. This can help to prevent health problems and other issues associated with the consumption of unsafe or low-quality alcoholic beverages.

Moreover, having a state-controlled company for the sale of alcoholic beverages can also help to generate revenue for the government. In Sweden, Systembolaget operates as a profit-making company, which means that the profits generated are used to fund important government initiatives and services. This helps to ensure that the costs associated with excessive alcohol consumption are not passed on to taxpayers.

Furthermore, a state-controlled company can also help to prevent price competition, which can lead to lower prices and increased consumption of alcohol. By maintaining control over the prices, the government can ensure that alcoholic beverages are not sold at artificially low prices, which can help to reduce the negative effects associated with excessive alcohol consumption.

However, it should be noted that there are some drawbacks to having a state-controlled company for the sale of alcoholic beverages. One of the main drawbacks is that it can be more expensive for consumers to purchase alcoholic beverages from a state-controlled company. Additionally, some people may view a state-controlled company as a form of government interference in their personal lives, which can be seen as a violation of individual freedom.

In conclusion, having a state-controlled company for the sale of alcoholic beverages, such as Systembolaget in Sweden, can have significant benefits in terms of reducing harm, preventing under-age drinking, ensuring the",1
388,0162.a2.txt,Is television good or bad for children?,"Television has been a part of the household for decades, and it is a popular form of entertainment for children. However, there is ongoing debate about the effects of television on children's development and behavior. In this essay, we will examine the potential benefits and drawbacks of television viewing for children, and explore whether it is ultimately good or bad for them.

One of the benefits of television for children is that it can serve as an educational tool. There are a wide variety of educational programming options available for children, such as news, science, and history shows, which can help to expand their knowledge and understanding of the world around them. Additionally, educational programming can also help to improve children's language and literacy skills.

Another benefit of television is that it can provide a source of entertainment and relaxation for children. Television can be an enjoyable way for children to unwind and relax after a long day of school or other activities. It can also serve as a form of escapism, allowing children to explore different worlds and experiences through the stories and characters they see on screen.

Furthermore, television can also have a positive impact on children's social development. Through watching television, children can learn about different cultures, perspectives and ways of life, which can help them to develop empathy and understanding towards others. Additionally, television can also serve as a way for children to bond with their families and friends, as they can watch shows and discuss them together.

Moreover, television can also be used as a tool to help children cope with difficult situations or emotions. For example, children who have experienced trauma or loss can use television as a way to process their feelings and emotions. Additionally, television can also serve as a tool to help children with special needs to develop their social and communication skills.

However, it should be noted that excessive television viewing can have negative effects on children's development and behavior. Prolonged television viewing can lead to decreased physical activity, which can contribute to obesity and other health problems. Additionally, excessive television viewing can also lead to decreased attention span, poor academic performance, and behavioral problems.

Additionally, the content of the programs that children watch can also have a negative impact on their development and behavior. Children are exposed to a wide variety of media messages, including violence, sex, and consumerism, which can have a negative impact on their values, attitudes and beliefs. Furthermore, children who watch a lot of television are more likely to be exposed to advertising, which can lead to materialism and a desire for instant gratification.

389,0163.a2.txt,Imprisonment - a bad solution,"Imprisonment has long been considered a primary solution for dealing with crime and criminal behavior. However, in recent years, there has been a growing movement towards alternative forms of punishment and rehabilitation, and there is a growing body of evidence that suggests that imprisonment may not be the most effective solution. In this essay, we will discuss why imprisonment is a bad solution for dealing with crime and criminal behavior.

One of the main reasons that imprisonment is a bad solution is that it is costly. The cost of maintaining a prison system, including the cost of housing, feeding, and providing medical care for prisoners, is extremely high. Additionally, the cost of law enforcement and the court system is also significant. This cost is borne by taxpayers, and it is a significant drain on public resources.

Furthermore, imprisonment does not effectively address the underlying causes of criminal behavior. Many criminals have underlying issues such as mental health problems, drug addiction, or poverty, which are not addressed by imprisonment. Instead, these issues are often exacerbated by the prison environment, leading to a higher likelihood of recidivism once the individual is released.

Moreover, imprisonment can lead to negative consequences for the families of prisoners. The loss of a breadwinner and the stigma of having a family member in prison can lead to poverty, and can also have a negative impact on the children and other family members. Additionally, the emotional toll of having a loved one in prison can lead to mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety.

Additionally, imprisonment can lead to negative consequences for society as a whole. The high rate of recidivism among ex-offenders can lead to increased crime and a lack of public safety. Furthermore, the social and economic costs of incarceration, such as lost productivity and increased health care costs, can have a significant impact on society as a whole.

An alternative solution to imprisonment is the use of community-based alternatives, such as rehabilitation programs, community service, and electronic monitoring. These alternatives have been shown to be more effective in addressing the underlying causes of criminal behavior and reducing recidivism. Additionally, they are often less costly than imprisonment and have fewer negative consequences for individuals, families and society.

However, it should be noted that community-based alternatives may not be suitable for all offenders, particularly those who pose a danger to public safety. In cases where public safety is a concern, imprisonment may be necessary. However, it is important to ensure that the offenders are given the opportunity to participate in rehabilitation and other programs that can help them to address the underlying causes of their criminal behavior.

In conclusion, imprisonment is a bad solution for dealing with crime and criminal behavior. It is costly, does not effectively address the underlying causes of criminal behavior, and can lead to negative consequences for individuals, families, and society. Alternative solutions, such as community-based alternatives, should be",1
390,0165.a2.txt,To preserve a language,"Language is a fundamental aspect of human culture, and it is the primary means through which we communicate, express ourselves, and transmit knowledge and culture. However, despite its importance, many languages are endangered, and there is a growing movement to preserve these languages. In this essay, we will discuss why it is important to preserve languages and the various benefits that come with it.

One of the main reasons why languages should be preserved is that they are an integral part of cultural heritage. Each language is a unique expression of the culture and history of the people who speak it, and it is a valuable resource for understanding the diversity of human experience. By preserving languages, we are preserving the cultural heritage of humanity and ensuring that future generations can understand and appreciate the richness of human culture.

Furthermore, preserving languages can help to promote social and cultural diversity. When languages are endangered, they are often replaced by dominant languages, which can lead to the erosion of cultural diversity. This can lead to the loss of traditional knowledge, customs, and practices, as well as a loss of social and cultural identity. By preserving languages, we are preserving the diversity of human culture and promoting the rights of minority and indigenous communities.

Moreover, preserving languages can also have significant benefits for cognitive development and education. Studies have shown that children who are exposed to multiple languages tend to have better cognitive skills, such as problem-solving, creativity, and critical thinking. Additionally, preserving languages can also promote better educational outcomes, as it allows children to learn in their native language and to have access to educational resources in their own language.

Additionally, preserving languages can also have economic benefits. For example, languages that are endangered are often replaced by dominant languages, which can limit the economic opportunities for people who speak those languages. Additionally, preserving languages can also have economic benefits for the tourism industry, as it can promote cultural tourism and attract visitors who are interested in experiencing different cultures and languages.

However, it should be noted that preserving languages is not an easy task. It requires significant effort, resources and commitment from the community and the government. Additionally, preserving languages also requires the support of the education system, media and the society at large. Furthermore, the preservation of languages also requires the active participation of the community and the willingness to adapt to the changing times.

In conclusion, preserving languages is an important task that has significant benefits for humanity. By preserving languages, we are preserving cultural heritage, promoting social and cultural diversity, improving cognitive development and education, and promoting economic development. It is crucial that efforts are made to preserve languages, and that we support the communities and cultures that are working to keep their languages alive.

""So, if alcohol is legal, why should not narcotics be"", the advocates of the legalisation of narcotics would say. But, making one terrible mistake does not entitle us to make another one. It is true that we do already have a lot of trouble in our society due to alcohol, which is sad enough. But I do not believe in making alcohol illegal, though, because the use of it has such deep traditional roots in our history and I think this tradition with, for example, the ceremony to drink a toast to someone on a special occasion, would therefore be extremely difficult to change.","The topic of legalizing narcotics, also known as drugs, is a highly controversial and complex issue. On one hand, advocates argue that legalization could help to reduce crime, improve public health, and generate revenue for the government. On the other hand, opponents argue that legalization would lead to increased drug use and a host of negative consequences for society. In this essay, we will examine the arguments for and against the legalization of narcotics, and explore the potential implications of such a policy.

One of the main arguments in favor of legalizing narcotics is that it would help to reduce crime. Advocates argue that the current approach to drug control, which focuses on criminalizing drug use and possession, has been ineffective in reducing crime and has led to a host of negative consequences, such as overcrowded prisons and increased violence. By legalizing drugs, the government could regulate their production, distribution, and sale, which would help to reduce crime associated with the black market.

Furthermore, legalizing narcotics could also improve public health. Advocates argue that the current approach, which criminalizes drug use, has led to a lack of access to safe and effective treatment for drug addiction. By legalizing drugs, the government could regulate their purity and quality, and provide access to harm reduction services such as needle exchange programs. Additionally, legalizing drugs would also reduce the spread of diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C, which are often associated with the use of unclean needles.

Moreover, legalizing narcotics could also generate revenue for the government. Advocates argue that by taxing and regulating the sale of drugs, the government could generate significant revenue, which could be used to fund public health and social services. Additionally, legalizing drugs would also reduce the cost associated with enforcing drug laws and incarceration.

However, it should be noted that there are also several arguments against legalizing narcotics. One of the main arguments is that legalization would lead to increased drug use, and a host of negative consequences for society. Opponents argue that legalizing drugs would make them more accessible and more socially acceptable, which would lead to increased drug use and addiction. Additionally, opponents argue that legalizing drugs would also lead to an increase in crime, as drug dealers would no longer be able to make a profit from the sale of illegal drugs.

Additionally, opponents argue that legalizing drugs would also have negative consequences for public health. They argue that legalizing drugs would lead to increased drug use and addiction, which would have a negative impact on physical and mental health. Furthermore, opponents argue that legalizing drugs would also lead to an increase in accidents, crime and other social problems.

On one hand, some argue that it should be made legal in order to promote sustainable use and conservation of elephants, while others argue that it should remain illegal in order to protect elephants from poaching and extinction. In this essay, we will examine the arguments for and against the legalization of the sale of elephant ivory, and explore the potential implications of such a policy.

One of the main arguments in favor of legalizing the sale of elephant ivory is that it would promote sustainable use and conservation of elephants. Advocates argue that legalizing the sale of elephant ivory would create economic incentives for local communities to conserve and protect elephants, rather than poach them for their ivory. Additionally, legal trade would also help to reduce the black market and illegal trade of elephant ivory, which is often associated with poaching and illegal killing of elephants.

Furthermore, legalizing the sale of elephant ivory could also generate revenue for conservation and elephant protection efforts. The revenue generated from legal sales could be used to fund conservation programs, anti-poaching efforts, and community-based elephant management. Additionally, it could also provide financial incentives for local communities to conserve and protect elephants, rather than poach them.

Moreover, legalizing the sale of elephant ivory could also help to improve the welfare of captive elephants.

In this essay, we will examine the arguments for and against homosexual parenting, and explore the potential implications of such a family structure.

One of the main arguments in favor of homosexual parenting is that it provides children with loving and stable homes. Same-sex couples and individuals are just as capable of raising happy and healthy children as heterosexual couples. Studies have shown that children raised by same-sex couples fare just as well as those raised by opposite-sex couples in terms of social, emotional and psychological well-being. Additionally, children of same-sex couples are no more likely to be bullied or experience social stigmatization than those raised by opposite-sex couples.

Furthermore, allowing same-sex couples and individuals to adopt and raise children helps to promote family diversity and inclusivity. Children raised in diverse families learn to understand, respect and appreciate different types of families and individuals. Additionally, same-sex parenting helps to ensure that all children have access to loving and stable homes, regardless of the sexual orientation or gender identity of the parents.

Moreover, homosexual parenting also helps to challenge and break down societal stereotypes and prejudices. By showing that same-sex couples and individuals are just as capable of raising happy, healthy and well-adjusted children as opposite-sex couples, it helps to challenge the notion that there is only one ""right"" type of family structure. Additionally, by promoting family diversity and inclusivity, homosexual parenting helps to create a more accepting and equal society for all.

Additionally, research also indicates that children raised by same-sex couples are more open-minded and accepting of diversity, including diversity in sexual orientations and gender identities. They also show more empathy, compassion and understanding of different family structures and are more likely to be accepting of different types of people.

However, it should be noted that there are also several arguments against homosexual parenting. One of the main arguments is that children raised by same-sex couples may experience social stigmatization and discrimination. Opponents argue that children raised by same-sex couples may be bullied or experience social stigmatization because of their parents' sexual orientation or gender identity. Additionally, opponents argue that children raised by same-sex couples may not have access to role models of the opposite sex, which could have negative effects on their development.

Additionally, some opponents argue that children raised by same-sex couples may experience emotional or psychological problems as a result of not having a mother or father figure. They argue that children",1

From communication to entertainment, education to business, the computer has had a profound impact on society. In this essay, we will explore the reasons why the computer is here to stay and the potential implications of this technology for the future.

One of the main reasons why the computer is here to stay is that it has become an essential tool for communication. The widespread adoption of the internet and the proliferation of mobile devices have made it possible for people to communicate with each other in ways that were previously unimaginable. Whether it is through email, instant messaging, social media or video conferencing, the computer has made it possible for people to stay connected with each other regardless of where they are in the world.

Additionally, the use of technology in the classroom has also helped to improve the quality of education and make it more accessible to people of all ages.

Moreover, the computer has also had a profound impact on the way we do business. The internet has made it possible for companies to reach new markets and customers, and has also made it possible for people to start their own businesses from the comfort of their own homes. Additionally, the use of technology in business has also helped to improve efficiency and productivity, which has led to increased growth and prosperity.

396,0173.a2.txt,Regulate the Swedish import of American films,"The import of American films into Sweden has been a topic of ongoing debate. While American films are popular in Sweden, there are those who argue that their import should be regulated in order to promote the Swedish film industry and culture. In this essay, we will examine the reasons why the regulation of the import of American films into Sweden is necessary, and the potential benefits of such a policy.

One of the main reasons why the regulation of the import of American films into Sweden is necessary is that it would promote the Swedish film industry. The Swedish film industry is a vital part of the country's cultural heritage and identity, and it is important for it to be supported and promoted. By regulating the import of American films, the government could ensure that the Swedish film industry has the opportunity to thrive and grow. Additionally, this would also allow for a more diverse representation of stories and perspectives in the Swedish film industry.

Furthermore, the regulation of the import of American films would also help to promote the Swedish language. The use of the Swedish language in film is an important way to promote and preserve the language and culture. By regulating the import of American films, the government could ensure that a certain percentage of films shown in Sweden are in Swedish or have subtitles in Swedish. This would help to promote the language and make it more accessible to viewers.

Moreover, regulation of the import of American films would also help to reduce cultural homogenization. The dominance of American culture in the media can lead to the erosion of local cultures and traditions. By regulating the import of American films, the government could ensure that a diverse range of stories and perspectives are represented in the media, promoting cultural diversity and preserving the country's cultural heritage.

Additionally, regulating the import of American films could also help to improve the balance of trade between Sweden and the United States. By promoting the Swedish film industry, the government could reduce the country's dependence on American films and create a more balanced trade relationship between the two countries.

However, it should be noted that there are also several arguments against regulating the import of American films into Sweden. One of the main arguments is that it would limit the freedom of choice for consumers. Opponents argue that regulating the import of American films would limit the availability of films for viewers and restrict their freedom of choice. Additionally, opponents argue that regulating the import of American films could also lead to increased costs for consumers.

Additionally, opponents argue that regulating the import of American films could also lead to decreased competition in the film industry. By promoting the Swedish film industry, the government could create a protected market, which could lead to decreased competition and a decrease in the quality of films.

Furthermore, opponents argue that regulating the",1
397,0174.a2.txt,"Give your children the best start in life, give them your time.","Giving children the time and attention of their parents is crucial for their development and well-being. In this essay, we will examine the reasons why giving children the parents' time is the best start in their lives, and the potential benefits of such an approach.

One of the main reasons why giving children the parents' time is the best start in their lives is that it helps to establish a strong emotional bond between the parent and child. When parents take the time to interact with their children, it helps to create a sense of security and trust, which is essential for the child's emotional development. Additionally, this emotional bond also helps to lay the foundation for healthy relationships throughout the child's life.

Furthermore, giving children the parents' time also helps to promote cognitive development. When parents take the time to engage with their children, it helps to stimulate their minds and promote learning. This can include activities such as reading, playing educational games, or taking trips to museums or other educational venues. Additionally, this time spent together also allows parents to provide guidance and mentorship, which can help children to develop important skills and abilities.

Moreover, giving children the parents' time also helps to promote physical development. When parents take the time to engage in physical activities with their children, it helps to promote healthy habits, such as regular exercise, good nutrition, and a healthy lifestyle. Additionally, this time spent together also helps to promote positive self-esteem and body image, which are important for overall physical and mental well-being.

Additionally, giving children the parents' time also helps to promote social development. When parents take the time to interact with their children, it helps to create opportunities for socialization, which can include activities such as playdates, sports teams, or other extracurricular activities. Additionally, this time spent together also allows parents to provide guidance and mentorship in social interactions, which can help children to develop important skills such as communication and problem-solving.

Furthermore, giving children the parents' time also helps to promote moral and spiritual development. When parents take the time to interact with their children, it helps to provide opportunities for conversation and reflection on important values and beliefs. Additionally, this time spent together also allows parents to provide guidance and mentorship in moral and spiritual development, which can help children to develop important skills such as empathy, compassion, and a sense of purpose.

However, it should be noted that giving children the parents' time does not mean that the parents should be constantly available 24/7, it is important for the parents to have their time and space as well. Additionally, it's important to recognize that there might be some limitations and difficulties, such as single-parent households, working parents",1
398,0175.a2.txt,Arguments to take stand against capital punishment,"Capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, is a legal punishment in which a person is put to death by the state as a consequence for a crime. The use of capital punishment is a contentious issue and there are those who argue that it is not a good solution for punishing criminals. In this essay, we will examine the reasons why capital punishment is not good, and the potential implications of such a policy.

One of the main reasons why capital punishment is not good is that it is not an effective deterrent to crime. Studies have shown that the death penalty does not have a greater deterrent effect on crime than other forms of punishment, such as life imprisonment. Additionally, the death penalty can also have a negative impact on the crime rate, as it can lead to a lack of public trust in the justice system, which can in turn lead to a rise in crime.

Furthermore, capital punishment is also not good because it is often applied in a discriminatory manner. The death penalty is often applied disproportionately to marginalized and minority communities, which can lead to a lack of trust in the justice system and a sense of injustice among these communities. Additionally, the death penalty is also often applied to those who are unable to afford adequate legal representation, which can lead to the execution of innocent people.

Moreover, capital punishment is also not good because it is often applied in a manner that is cruel and inhumane. The use of the death penalty can involve prolonged suffering and can lead to a lack of compassion for the perpetrator, which can have a negative impact on the perpetrator's rehabilitation and reintegration into society. Additionally, the use of the death penalty can also lead to a lack of compassion for the victims and their families, which can have a negative impact on their healing and recovery.

Additionally, capital punishment is also not good because it is often applied in a manner that is flawed and prone to error. The use of the death penalty can involve the use of unreliable evidence, such as eyewitness testimony, which can lead to the execution of innocent people. Additionally, the use of the death penalty can also involve procedural errors, such as the use of biased or incompetent lawyers, which can lead to the execution of innocent people.

Furthermore, capital punishment is also not good because it is often applied in a manner that is irreversible. Once a person has been put to death, it is impossible to correct any errors that may have occurred during the trial or appeals process. This means that if new evidence emerges or if a convicted person is later proven to be innocent, it is too late to rectify the situation.

Moreover, capital punishment is also not good because it is costly. The death penalty can cost more than life imprisonment because of the added costs of appeals, legal representation",1
399,0176.a2.txt,Stub Out!,"Smoking is a harmful habit that can lead to a variety of health problems, including cancer, heart disease, and respiratory illness. In this essay, we will examine the reasons why smoking is a dangerous habit and the potential implications of smoking for an individual's health and well-being.

One of the main reasons why smoking is dangerous is that it increases the risk of lung cancer. Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, and it is responsible for 85% of lung cancer deaths. Additionally, smoking can also increase the risk of other types of cancer, such as throat, bladder, and pancreatic cancer.

Furthermore, smoking also increases the risk of heart disease. Smoking can damage the heart and blood vessels, which can lead to heart attacks and stroke. Additionally, smoking can also increase the risk of peripheral vascular disease, which is a circulation disorder that can lead to amputations.

Moreover, smoking also increases the risk of respiratory illness. Smoking can damage the lungs and airways, which can lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and other respiratory problems. Additionally, smoking can also increase the risk of pneumonia and other lung infections.

Additionally, smoking is also a major risk factor for other health problems, such as diabetes, osteoporosis, and cataracts. Smoking can also affect the fertility of both men and women, and can lead to complications during pregnancy. Additionally, smoking can also affect the health of those around the smoker, through secondhand smoke exposure.

400,0177.a2.txt,Segregation in the United States,"Segregation refers to the practice of separating people based on their race, ethnicity, or other characteristics. In the United States, segregation has a long history and has been used to discriminate against and marginalize people of color and other minority groups. In this essay, we will examine the reasons why segregation has been used in the US, the forms it has taken and its impact on society.

One of the main reasons why segregation has been used in the US is to maintain and reinforce the social, economic, and political power of the white majority. From the late 19th century to the mid-20th century, segregation laws and practices were used to deny people of color equal access to education, housing, employment, and other opportunities. This helped to maintain a system of white supremacy and ensure that people of color remained in a position of subordination.

Segregation has taken many forms throughout American history. Some of the most notable forms include:

Jim Crow laws: These laws were implemented in the late 19th century and enforced racial segregation in the Southern states. These laws mandated segregation in public spaces such as schools, public transportation and businesses.
Residential segregation: This refers to the practice of separating people of different races into different neighborhoods. This was often achieved through discriminatory housing practices, such as redlining, which made it difficult for people of color to purchase homes in white neighborhoods.
Educational segregation: This refers to the practice of separating students of different races into different schools. This was often achieved through the use of ""separate but equal"" laws, which allowed for the creation of separate schools for white and Black students.
The impacts of segregation are far reaching and long-lasting. The segregation of housing, education, and other public spaces has led to a significant level of racial inequality and disparities in health, education, income, and overall well-being. Additionally, the practice of segregation",1

Some people argue that watching television is dangerous and can have negative effects on an individual's physical, mental, and social well-being. However, there is also evidence to suggest that watching television can be beneficial when done in moderation and with the right content. In this essay, we will examine the reasons why watching television is not inherently dangerous, and the potential benefits of this activity.

One of the main reasons why watching television is not dangerous is that it can provide a form of entertainment and relaxation. Television can provide a source of distraction and escapism, which can be beneficial for people who are dealing with stress, anxiety, or other mental health issues. Additionally, watching television can also provide a sense of social connection, as people can bond over shared interests and enjoy watching their favorite shows together.

Furthermore, watching television can also be beneficial for education and learning. Many television shows, documentaries and educational programs provide a wealth of information and knowledge on a wide range of topics. This can be especially beneficial for children, as educational programming can help to enhance their cognitive, linguistic, and social development.

Moreover, watching television can also have positive effects on physical health. Studies have found that people who engage in sedentary activities, such as watching television, have a lower risk of developing chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and some forms of cancer. Additionally, television can also be a valuable tool for health education and awareness, as many health-related programs provide accurate and informative information on various health topics.

Additionally, watching television can also have positive effects on mental health. Studies have found that watching television can be beneficial for people who are dealing with depression, loneliness, or other mental health issues. Additionally, watching television can also provide a sense of emotional connection and empathy, as people can relate to and identify with the characters and stories they see on screen.

Furthermore, watching television can also have positive effects on social well-being. Television can be a powerful tool for promoting social issues and encouraging people to engage in critical thinking and social action. Additionally, television can also provide a sense of community and belonging, as people can connect with others over shared interests and values.

It is important to note that the negative effects of watching television are not caused by the act of watching itself, but by the excessive and prolonged amount of time spent in front of screens and the type of content that is being watched. Excessive screen time can lead to physical health issues such as obesity and",1
402,0179.a2.txt,The choice of geriactic care,"Geriatric care refers to the care and support provided to older adults who are facing age-related health challenges. The choice of geriatric care is an important decision that can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life and well-being. In this essay, we will examine the different options available for geriatric care and the factors that should be considered when making this choice.

One of the main options for geriatric care is in-home care. This type of care involves having a caregiver come to the individual's home to provide assistance with daily activities, such as bathing, dressing, and medication management. In-home care can be a good option for older adults who want to maintain their independence and remain in their own home, but who need assistance with daily tasks.

Another option for geriatric care is assisted living. Assisted living facilities provide a range of services, including housing, meals, and personal care. These facilities are designed to provide a supportive and homelike environment, and many offer a variety of social and recreational activities. Assisted living can be a good option for older adults who need more help with daily activities than can be provided in the home, but who do not require the level of care provided in a nursing home.

A third option for geriatric care is nursing homes. Nursing homes provide 24-hour care and supervision, and are typically used for older adults who have complex medical needs or who require assistance with daily living. They offer a wide range of services including nursing care, therapy, and rehabilitation. They can also provide a more secure environment for older adults with cognitive impairments or memory loss.

When choosing a geriatric care option, it is important to consider the individual's health needs, preferences, and financial situation. The older adult's physical and cognitive abilities, as well as their current health conditions should be taken into account. The individual's preferences and goals should also be considered, such as wanting to remain in their own home, or needing more social interaction. Additionally, the cost of care should be considered when making the decision, as it can vary greatly depending on the type of care and the location.

It's also important to keep in mind that geriatric care is not a one-time decision and it might change as the older adult's needs change, so it's important to be prepared for that and be open to reassessing the care options as time goes on.

Additionally, it's important to research the different options available in the local area,",1
403,0180.a2.txt,Who is to take care of your children?,"The question of who will take care of one's children is an important and often complex one that parents must consider. It is a decision that can have a significant impact on the well-being and development of the children, and it is important that parents carefully consider their options before making a decision. In this essay, we will examine the different options available for child care and the factors that parents should consider when making this decision.

One of the most common options for child care is in-home care by a family member or friend. This type of care involves having a trusted and familiar person take care of the children in the parents' home. This can be a good option for parents who want their children to be in a familiar and comfortable environment, and who want their children to be cared for by someone they know and trust.

Another option for child care is a daycare center. Daycare centers provide care for children in a group setting, and typically offer a range of activities and educational opportunities. They are often licensed and regulated by the state, and are required to meet certain standards for safety and care. This can be a good option for parents who want their children to be in a structured and educational environment, and who want the peace of mind that comes with knowing that their children are being cared for by trained and qualified professionals.

A third option for child care is a nanny. Nannies are trained and experienced caregivers who come to the parents' home to take care of the children. They can provide a high level of individualized care and attention, and can often provide additional services such as light housekeeping and meal preparation. This can be a good option for parents who want their children to have a one-on-one caregiver and who want the flexibility that comes with having a nanny in the home.

When choosing a child care option, parents should consider a number of factors. These include the age and developmental needs of the children, the parents' work schedules, and the cost of care. Additionally, parents should consider the location of the child care option, as well as the qualifications and experience of the caregivers.

It is also important for parents to visit the different child care options available and to ask questions about the policies and practices of the providers. It's also important to observe how the children are treated, how the caregivers interact with the children and the overall atmosphere of the center or home.

It's also important to keep in mind that the child care options that were suitable when the children were young might not be suitable as they grow older, so",1
404,0182.a2.txt,Sweden should leave the European Union,"The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 27 European countries. Sweden, being a member of the EU, has to comply with EU regulations and laws, as well as contribute to the EU budget. However, there are some arguments in favor of Sweden leaving the EU. In this essay, we will examine the reasons why some argue that Sweden should leave the EU and the potential implications of such a move.

One of the main arguments in favor of Sweden leaving the EU is the issue of sovereignty. Some argue that Sweden should regain control over its own laws and regulations, rather than being subject to the laws and regulations of the EU. Additionally, they argue that Sweden should have the freedom to make its own trade deals and have more control over its own borders.

Furthermore, some argue that Sweden's economy would be better off outside of the EU. They argue that the EU's regulations and policies have a negative impact on Sweden's economy, and that leaving the EU would allow Sweden to pursue its own economic interests. Additionally, some argue that the EU's bureaucratic and political structure is inefficient, and that leaving the EU would allow for a more streamlined decision-making process.

Another argument in favor of leaving the EU is that it would allow Sweden to take a more independent approach in foreign policy. Some argue that Sweden's foreign policy interests do not always align with those of the EU, and that leaving the EU would allow Sweden to pursue its own foreign policy goals. Additionally, some argue that the EU's foreign policy is ineffective and that Sweden would be better off pursuing its own foreign policy goals.

Additionally, some argue that Sweden should leave the EU because of the rising tide of Euroscepticism in the country. They argue that the EU has lost the support of many Swedes and that it is no longer seen as a positive force for the country.

However, it's important to note that leaving the EU would not be without its challenges and risks, such as losing access to the EU's single market and the potential loss of trade agreements with EU member countries. Additionally, it would likely lead to a period of economic uncertainty and could potentially have a negative impact on businesses and the labor market. It could also lead to a loss of influence on the international stage and a decrease in cooperation in areas such as security and defense.

In conclusion, while there are arguments in favor of Sweden leaving the EU, it is a complex issue with many potential implications. It's important for Sweden to carefully consider the pros and cons before making a decision, and to weigh the potential impact on the country's economy,",1
405,0185.a2.txt,Stop animal experimentation!,"Animal experimentation, also known as animal testing, is the use of animals in scientific and medical research. The practice has long been a source of controversy and debate, with some arguing that it is a necessary tool for advancing scientific knowledge and medical treatment, while others argue that it is cruel, inhumane, and unnecessary. In this essay, we will examine the reasons why animal experimentation should be stopped, and the alternatives that are available.

One of the main reasons why animal experimentation should be stopped is that it is cruel and inhumane. Animals used in experimentation are often subjected to painful procedures and kept in confined, unnatural conditions. Additionally, many animals used in experimentation do not survive the procedures, and those that do are often killed at the end of the study.

Furthermore, animal experimentation is not always reliable or relevant to human health. The physiology and physiology of animals, as well as their anatomy, are different from humans and results of animal testing may not be applicable to humans. Additionally, animal experiments can produce false results which can lead to flawed medical treatments and delayed progress in scientific research.

Additionally, there are many alternatives to animal experimentation that are available and that are more reliable and humane. For example, in-vitro methods, such as cell and tissue culture, can be used to study the effects of drugs and other compounds on human cells without the need for animal testing. Additionally, computer simulations, mathematical models, and human-patient simulators can also be used to study the effects of drugs and other compounds on human physiology and physiology.

Moreover, non-animal methods are often more efficient and cost-effective than animal experimentation. For instance, in-vitro methods are faster and cheaper than animal experimentation, and they can also produce more relevant results. Additionally, non-animal methods can also be used to study diseases that cannot be effectively modeled in animals, such as some human-specific cancers.

Moreover, it's important to note that animal experimentation is not only morally wrong but it's also becoming obsolete. There are more accurate and ethical ways to conduct scientific research and to develop new medical treatments.

In conclusion, animal experimentation is a cruel and inhumane practice that should be stopped. It is not always reliable or relevant to human health, and there are many alternatives available that are more efficient, cost-effective, and humane. It's essential that scientific research and medical treatment advance in a way that doesn't put animals in harm's way, and that we as a society can make that happen by supporting and investing in non-animal research methods.",1
406,0186.a2.txt,Nature Vs The human being,"Nature and human beings have a complex and often contentious relationship. On one hand, nature provides the resources and systems that support human life, and many people find solace and inspiration in the natural world. On the other hand, human activities have had a significant impact on the natural world, causing widespread destruction and degradation of ecosystems. In this essay, we will examine the relationship between nature and human beings and the implications of this relationship.

One of the main ways that human beings have impacted nature is through the destruction and degradation of ecosystems. Human activities such as deforestation, urbanization, and pollution have led to the loss of biodiversity and the decline of many species. Additionally, climate change, driven by human activities, is causing widespread changes to the planet's ecosystems, leading to the displacement of species and the loss of critical habitats.

Furthermore, human activities have also led to the depletion of natural resources. Overfishing, overhunting, and overconsumption have led to the decline of many species, and the extraction of fossil fuels, minerals, and other resources has caused significant damage to the natural world. Additionally, the rapid growth of human populations is putting increasing pressure on the earth's resources, and it is likely that this will continue to cause damage to the natural world.

Moreover, the relationship between nature and human beings is not just about the negative impact of human activities on the natural world. Nature also plays a vital role in human well-being and survival. Many people depend on nature for their livelihoods, and access to clean air, water, and healthy food are all dependent on the natural world. Additionally, nature can provide important benefits for human health and well-being, such as reducing stress, improving mood and cognitive function.

However, the relationship between nature and human beings is not always",1
407,0187.a2.txt,"In Sweden we have a great historical heritage of monarchs that dates back over a thousand years. Many were powerful and influential, some of which gained a high international status and successfully enlarged the Swedish kingdom. I see no reason for ending that long tradition of monarchs now. Karl XVI Gustav is a national symbol and will remain as one for the rest of his life and will then pass on his title to his daughter Victoria. It is a comfort to know what will happen to the royal family and that something will stay the same in Sweden while so many other things change. There will not be the same thing with a President, who will not be the same person for a longer period of time. It will always be an uncertianty about how he will manage his job as representative of Sweden. Some Presidents will probably perform this task in an admirable way, but some will manage less good. The ones who are not good at representative tasks will in a way make Sweden look bad outwards. Therefore it is better to rely on a professional in this area, that is our king, who has had this as a job all his adult life and obtained a lot of experience and is used to be in the centre of attention. The Swedish royal family has a lot of contacts abroad, mainly with other royal families, which can come in handy in times of crises and they might then be able to turn to other countries for assistance.","The Swedish monarchy is one of the oldest in the world, with roots dating back to the 10th century.

Additionally, the Swedish monarchy is also an important part of the country's cultural heritage, and it is an important part of the country's cultural identity.

Additionally, the Swedish monarchy plays an important role in the country's political system. The monarch serves as a constitutional head of state, and plays a role in the country's political process by appointing the Prime Minister and other government officials. Additionally, the monarch also plays a ceremonial role, representing the country at important national and international events.

Moreover, the Swedish monarchy has a long-standing tradition of philanthropy and social responsibility. The Royal family has been involved in charitable and social causes for centuries, and continues to be actively involved in promoting charitable causes such as child welfare, environmental protection, and culture.

Finally, preserving the Swedish monarchy is also a way to maintain a sense of tradition and continuity. The monarchy has been a part of the country for over a thousand years, and it serves as a reminder of the country's rich history and cultural heritage.

The death penalty is a highly controversial and divisive issue, with strong opinions on both sides of the debate. One of the main arguments against capital punishment is that it is nothing but ""judicial murder."" In this essay, we will examine the reasons why some argue that capital punishment is a form of judicial murder and the implications of this perspective.

One of the main arguments against capital punishment is that it is a form of judicial murder. This perspective argues that the death penalty is an unnecessary and inhumane punishment that serves no purpose other than to take the life of an individual. They argue that the state has no right to take the life of a person and that capital punishment violates the fundamental right to life.

Furthermore, capital punishment is often seen as discriminatory and arbitrary. This is because it is disproportionately applied to marginalized and oppressed groups, such as people of color, the poor, and those with mental illnesses. Additionally, the application of the death penalty is often arbitrary, with some people receiving the death penalty for similar crimes while others receive lesser punishments.

Moreover, capital punishment does not serve as a deterrent to crime. Studies have shown that the death penalty does not significantly reduce crime rates, and that other forms of punishment, such as life imprisonment, are just as effective in deterring crime. Additionally, the death penalty is not reversible, and if an innocent person is executed, there is no way to undo the mistake.

Additionally, capital punishment is often plagued by legal and procedural errors. The legal process for capital punishment cases is often lengthy and costly, and there have been numerous cases where individuals have been sentenced to death only to be later exonerated. Furthermore, the appeals process for capital punishment cases is often slow, and it can take years for a case to be heard.

Furthermore, capital punishment is often seen as a symbol of a society's failure. It is often used as a way to avoid addressing the underlying social issues that lead to crime, such as poverty, inequality, and lack of access to education and healthcare.

In conclusion, capital punishment is a highly controversial and divisive issue, with strong opinions on both sides of the debate. Those who argue that capital punishment is a form of judicial murder, argue that it is unnecessary, inhumane, discriminatory, arbitrary, and does not serve as a deterrent to crime. They also argue that it is often plagued by legal and procedural errors, and that it is a symbol of a society's failure to address underlying social issues. It's important for society to consider these arguments and weigh the pros and cons before making a decision on whether to continue with the use of capital punishment or not.",1
409,0189.a2.txt,About LEGALIZING ABORTIONS,"Abortion is the medical or surgical termination of a pregnancy. The issue of abortion is a highly controversial and divisive one, with passionate opinions on both sides of the debate. Some argue that abortion should be legal and accessible, while others argue that it should be illegal and restricted. In this essay, we will examine the reasons why some argue that abortion should be legalised, and the potential implications of such a move.

One of the main arguments in favor of legalising abortion is that it is a matter of reproductive rights. This perspective argues that a woman has the right to control her own body and make decisions about her own pregnancy. Additionally, legalising abortion would ensure that women have access to safe and legal abortion services, rather than being forced to seek out unsafe and illegal methods.

Furthermore, legalising abortion would also help to reduce maternal mortality rates. In countries where abortion is illegal or restricted, women often resort to unsafe methods to terminate their pregnancies, which can lead to serious health complications and even death. Legalising abortion would ensure that women have access to safe and legal abortion services, which would help to reduce maternal mortality rates.

Moreover, legalising abortion would also help to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies. When abortion is illegal or restricted, women may not have access to effective contraception, which can lead to unwanted pregnancies. Additionally, when women do not have access to safe and legal abortion services, they may resort to unsafe methods to terminate their pregnancies, which can lead to serious health complications.

Additionally, legalising abortion would also help to reduce the number of children born into poverty. When women are unable to access safe and legal abortion services, they may be forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term, which can lead to more children being born into poverty.

However, it's important to consider that legalisation of abortion may also lead to some negative consequences. For example, some argue that legalisation of abortion may lead to an increase in the number of abortions, as well as an erosion of the cultural and moral values of society. Additionally, some argue that legalisation of abortion may lead to an increase in the number of children born into poverty, as well as an erosion of the cultural and moral values of society.

In conclusion, the issue of abortion is a complex and controversial one, with passionate opinions on both sides of the debate. Those who argue in favor of legalising abortion argue that it is a matter of reproductive rights, that it would help to reduce maternal mortality rates, unwanted pregnancies and poverty. However, it's important to consider the potential negative consequences of legalisation of abortion. It's essential for society to weigh the pros and cons before making a decision on whether to legalise or not, and to consider the potential implications of such a move.",1
410,0190.a2.txt,Watchfulness Will Avoid Children Falling Into the Hands of Paedophiles.,"Paedophilia, also known as child sexual abuse, is a serious and pervasive problem in society. Children are often targeted by paedophiles, who groom and manipulate them for their own sexual gratification. In this essay, we will examine the importance of watchfulness in preventing children from falling into the hands of paedophiles.

One of the most important ways to prevent children from falling into the hands of paedophiles is through watchfulness. This means being aware of the signs and indicators of child sexual abuse, as well as being vigilant in protecting children from potential predators. Parents and caregivers can play an important role in this by being aware of the signs of abuse and taking action if they suspect that a child is being targeted by a paedophile.

Additionally, it's important to educate children about the dangers of paedophilia and how to protect themselves. Children should be taught to be aware of potential predators, and to be able to recognize the signs of grooming and manipulation. They should also be taught to report any suspicious behavior to a trusted adult.

Furthermore, it's also essential to have good communication with children, making them feel comfortable to talk about any concerns they may have, and to create an environment where they feel safe to express themselves. This way, if a child is being targeted by a paedophile, they will be more likely to come forward and report it to a trusted adult.

Moreover, having a good support network is important to prevent children from falling into the hands of paedophiles. This can include having a support system in place for children who have been affected by abuse, as well as working with community organizations and law enforcement agencies to identify potential predators and take action to protect children.

Additionally, it's important to create a community that is not tolerant of paedophilia. This means taking a stand against those who abuse children, and working to create a culture where child sexual abuse is not accepted. This can include supporting laws and policies that protect children from abuse, as well as working to change societal attitudes towards paedophilia.

In conclusion, watchfulness is a key element in preventing children from falling into the hands of paedophiles. It's important to be aware of the signs and indicators of child sexual abuse, to educate children about how to protect themselves, and to create a support network that can help to protect children from abuse. Additionally, it's important to create a culture where child sexual abuse is not accepted and to work with community organizations and law enforcement agencies to identify potential predators and take action to protect children. By being vigilant and taking action, we can work to protect children from the devastating effects of paedophilia.",1
411,0191.a2.txt,Keep the monopoly of Systembolaget,"Systembolaget is the state-owned chain of liquor stores in Sweden that has a monopoly on the retail sale of alcoholic beverages that contain more than 3.5% alcohol by volume. The system was established in 1955 as a measure to reduce alcohol-related problems in Sweden. In this essay, we will examine the reasons why some argue that the monopoly of Systembolaget should be maintained and the benefits that it brings to society.

One of the main reasons to maintain the monopoly of Systembolaget is to reduce alcohol-related problems in society. The Swedish system is designed to make it more difficult for people to purchase high-strength alcoholic beverages, and it has been successful in reducing alcohol-related problems in Sweden. Studies have shown that countries with state-controlled alcohol retail systems, such as Sweden, have lower rates of alcohol-related harm than countries with more liberal systems.

Furthermore, the monopoly of Systembolaget also helps to regulate the sale of alcohol and prevent the sale of alcohol to minors. The state-controlled system allows for strict regulations on the sale of alcohol and ensures that only licensed sellers can sell alcohol. Additionally, the system allows for strict age verification processes to prevent the sale of alcohol to minors.

Moreover, the monopoly of Systembolaget also helps to ensure that alcohol is sold responsibly and in a controlled environment. The state-controlled system ensures that all alcohol is sold in a regulated and controlled environment, with trained staff and strict regulations in place to prevent overconsumption. Additionally, the system ensures that all alcohol is sold at a consistent price, which helps to prevent price competition and overconsumption.

Additionally, the monopoly of Systembolaget also helps to generate revenue for the state. The state-controlled system allows for the sale of alcohol to be taxed, which generates revenue for the government. This revenue can be used to fund public services and programs, such as healthcare and education.

However, it's important to consider that maintaining the monopoly of Systembolaget may also lead to some negative consequences. For example, some argue that the monopoly of Systembolaget may lead to higher prices for consumers, as well as reduced consumer choice. Additionally, some argue that the monopoly of Systembolaget may lead to corruption and inefficiency in the system.

In conclusion, the monopoly of Systembolaget is a complex issue, with passionate opinions on both sides of the debate. Those who argue that the monopoly of Systembolaget should be maintained argue that it helps to reduce alcohol-related problems, regulate the sale of alcohol, and generate revenue for the state. However, it's important to consider the potential negative consequences of maintaining the monopoly of Systembolaget, such as higher prices for consumers and reduced consumer choice. Society should weigh the pros and cons before making a decision on whether to continue with the monopoly of Systembolaget or not, and consider the potential implications of such a move.",1
412,0192.a2.txt,Let the girls talk,"The ability to express oneself freely and openly is a fundamental human right and an essential aspect of personal development. However, for many girls and women, this right is often suppressed and their voices are not heard. In this essay, we will examine the importance of letting girls talk and the benefits it brings to individuals and society.

One of the most important reasons to let girls talk is to promote gender equality. When girls are allowed to express themselves freely and openly, they are empowered to participate in society on an equal footing with boys and men. This helps to promote gender equality, as girls are able to make their voices heard and take part in decision-making processes that affect their lives.

Furthermore, letting girls talk also helps to promote mental and emotional well-being. Girls who are able to express themselves freely and openly are more likely to have healthy relationships, be better able to cope with stress, and have a better sense of self-worth. Additionally, when girls are encouraged to speak up, they are more likely to seek help if they encounter a problem, which can lead to improved mental and emotional well-being.

Moreover, letting girls talk also helps to promote education. When girls are allowed to express themselves freely, they are more likely to be engaged in their education and to perform better academically. Additionally, when girls are encouraged to speak up, they are more likely to report any problems they encounter in school, which can lead to improved educational outcomes.

Additionally, letting girls talk also helps to promote social change. Girls who are able to express themselves freely and openly are more likely to be aware of social issues and to take action to address them. This can lead to positive social change, as girls are able to make their voices heard and take part in decision-making processes that affect their lives and the lives of others.

However, it's important to consider that letting girls talk may also lead to some negative consequences. For example, some may argue that letting girls talk may lead to a loss of tradition, culture or values. Additionally, some may argue that letting girls talk may lead to a loss of control, or lack of respect for authority",1
413,0193.a2.txt,Why You and the Rest of the World Would Gain from a Vegetarian Diet,"A vegetarian diet is a diet that excludes meat, poultry, fish, and often other animal products such as dairy and eggs. There are many reasons why people choose to follow a vegetarian diet, including health, environmental, and ethical concerns. In this essay, we will examine the benefits of a vegetarian diet and how it can improve overall health and well-being.

One of the main benefits of a vegetarian diet is that it can lower the risk of chronic diseases. Studies have shown that vegetarians tend to have lower rates of heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer. This is likely due to the fact that a vegetarian diet is high in fiber, antioxidants, and phytochemicals and is typically low in saturated fat and cholesterol. Additionally, a vegetarian diet is also associated with a lower body mass index (BMI) and a lower risk of obesity.

Furthermore, a vegetarian diet can also improve gut health. A diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes is high in fiber, which promotes regular bowel movements and prevents constipation. Additionally, a vegetarian diet is also associated with a higher intake of prebiotics, which are non-digestible carbohydrates that promote the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut.

Moreover, a vegetarian diet can also have a positive impact on the environment. The production of meat, particularly beef and lamb, is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation. Additionally, the production of animal products also requires large amounts of water and land. By reducing or eliminating meat consumption, vegetarians can reduce their environmental footprint and contribute to the preservation of the planet.

Additionally, a vegetarian diet can also provide ethical benefits. By choosing not to consume animal products, vegetarians can reduce the demand for factory-farmed animals, which are often kept in inhumane conditions. Additionally, by choosing not to consume animal products, vegetarians can also help to reduce the number of animals that are killed for food each year.

It's important to note that a vegetarian diet may not be appropriate for everyone, and some people may have medical or dietary restrictions that make it difficult to follow this type of diet. It's important for individuals to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian to ensure that they are getting all of the necessary nutrients. Additionally, it's important for vegetarians to ensure that",1
414,0194.a2.txt,THE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS NEVER RIGHT!,"Capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, is a legal punishment in which a person is put to death by the state as a consequence for a crime. The issue of capital punishment is a highly controversial and divisive one, with passionate opinions on both sides of the debate. In this essay, we will examine the reasons why some argue that capital punishment is never right and the potential implications of such a belief.

One of the main arguments against capital punishment is that it is a violation of the right to life. The right to life is a fundamental human right and is protected by international law. Capital punishment is a irrevocable, irreversible punishment, that goes against the principle of human rights.

Furthermore, capital punishment is also seen as a form of cruel and inhumane punishment. The methods of execution used in capital punishment, such as lethal injection, hanging, or electrocution, can cause severe pain and suffering. Additionally, the prolonged and uncertain wait on death row can also cause severe psychological harm to the condemned.

Moreover, capital punishment is also seen as a flawed system that is prone to error. There have been numerous cases where individuals have been wrongfully convicted and sentenced to death. This is a serious concern, as the death penalty cannot be undone if an innocent person is executed.

Additionally, capital punishment is also seen as a costly and ineffective deterrent to crime. Studies have shown that the death penalty does not have a greater deterrent effect on crime than alternative forms of punishment, such as life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Furthermore, the cost of a death penalty case is significantly higher than that of a case where life imprisonment is sought, which diverts resources from other areas of criminal justice.

Moreover, Capital punishment is also seen as a form of discrimination against marginalized communities. Historically, capital punishment has been disproportionately applied to marginalized groups such as people of color, people with low income and those with intellectual disabilities.

Furthermore, capital punishment is also seen as a form of revenge and not justice. Revenge is the act of seeking payback for a wrong or injury, while justice is the act of upholding what is right and fair. Capital punishment is a form of punishment that aims to inflict pain and suffering on the offender as a form of revenge, rather than to serve as a fair and just punishment.

In conclusion, capital punishment is a highly controversial and divisive issue, with passionate opinions on both sides of the debate. Those who argue that capital punishment is never right argue that it is a violation of the right to life, a form of cruel and inhumane punishment, a flawed system that is prone to error, costly and ineffective deterrent to crime, a form of discrimination and",1
415,0195.a2.txt,Sweden in the EU - or not?,"Sweden is a country located in Northern Europe, known for its picturesque landscapes, high standard of living, and strong welfare system. The country is also a member of the European Union (EU), having joined in 1995. However, the question of whether Sweden should remain in the EU or not has been a topic of debate for many years. In this essay, I will explore the arguments for and against Sweden's membership in the EU, and consider the implications of either decision.

One of the main arguments in favor of Sweden's membership in the EU is the economic benefits it brings. The EU is the world's largest market, and being a member allows Swedish companies to access this market without tariffs or trade barriers. This has led to increased exports and economic growth for the country. Additionally, being a member of the EU has also led to an increase in foreign investment in Sweden, as companies are attracted to the country's stable economy and well-educated workforce.

Another argument in favor of Sweden's membership in the EU is the political and security benefits it brings. The EU is a community of nations that work together to promote peace and stability in Europe. Being a member of the EU allows Sweden to have a say in the decisions that affect the continent and to work with other countries to address common challenges such as migration, climate change, and terrorism. Furthermore, the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy enables Sweden to amplify its voice in the international arena, a benefit that would be hard to achieve alone.

Despite these benefits, there are also arguments against Sweden's membership in the EU. One of the main concerns is the loss of sovereignty. As a member of the EU, Sweden is subject to the laws and regulations of the EU, which means that some decisions that would normally be made by the Swedish government are now made at the EU level. This has led to concerns that Sweden's ability to govern itself has been diminished.

Another concern is the financial cost of being a member of the EU. Sweden, like all other EU member states, is required to make contributions to the EU budget. These contributions are used to fund various EU projects and initiatives, such as the Common Agricultural Policy and the European Regional Development Fund. While these contributions are not insignificant, they are a small fraction of the overall budget, and the benefits that come with being a member of the EU often outweigh the costs.

Lastly, some critics argue that the EU is a failing organization, plagued by bureaucratic inefficiency and democratic deficits. They argue that Sweden would be better off outside the EU, focusing on its own domestic issues and building stronger relationships with other countries outside the EU.

In conclusion, the question of whether Sweden should remain in the EU or not is a complex one, with valid arguments on both sides. On one hand, the EU offers Sweden economic and political benefits, such as access to the world's largest market and the ability to have a say in the decisions that affect the continent. On the other hand, there are concerns about the loss of sovereignty and the financial cost of being a member. Ultimately, the decision of whether Sweden should remain in the EU or not is a matter for the Swedish people to decide through democratic means. In the meanwhile, it is important to evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of EU membership and consider the long-term implications of either decision.",1
416,0196.a2.txt,With rights come obligations,"The idea of requiring people who are receiving unemployment benefits to do unpaid work has been a topic of debate for many years. On one hand, some argue that with rights come obligations, and that those who are receiving unemployment benefits should be required to give back to their communities in the form of unpaid work. On the other hand, others argue that this would be a form of exploitation and that those who are unemployed should not be forced to work for free. In this essay, I will explore the arguments for and against requiring people who are receiving unemployment benefits to do unpaid work, and consider the implications of such a policy.

One of the main arguments in favor of requiring people who are receiving unemployment benefits to do unpaid work is that it would be a way for them to give back to their communities. Unemployment benefits are paid for by the taxpayers, and many believe that those who are receiving these benefits should be required to do something in return. Unpaid work would provide an opportunity for those who are unemployed to contribute to their communities in a meaningful way, while also helping to build their skills and experience.

Another argument in favor of requiring unpaid work for those receiving unemployment benefits is that it would help to reduce the costs of these benefits. Unemployment benefits can be costly for governments to administer, and requiring those who are receiving these benefits to do unpaid work would help to offset some of these costs. Additionally, it would also help to reduce the number of people who are reliant on unemployment benefits, which would be beneficial for the overall economy.

However, there are also valid arguments against requiring people who are receiving unemployment benefits to do unpaid work. One of the main concerns is that it would be a form of exploitation. Unemployed individuals are already in a vulnerable situation, and requiring them to work for free would only add to their difficulties. Furthermore, it is important to remember that the unemployed are not receiving benefits out of choice, but out of necessity. They should not be punished for being unemployed, and should not be forced to work for free.

Another concern is that requiring unpaid work for those receiving unemployment benefits would be unfair to those who are already working. They are already paying taxes, and should not be expected to subsidize the unpaid work of those who are receiving unemployment benefits. Furthermore, it could also lead to resentment and division among the employed and unemployed.

Lastly, it is important to consider the practicality of such a policy. Unpaid work would require to be supervised, coordinated, and managed. It would also require to be in line with the unemployed's skills, capabilities and goals. This would create an additional administrative burden on government and non-profit organizations and it could be difficult to ensure that the unpaid work is meaningful and beneficial to the unemployed individual and society.

In conclusion, the idea of requiring people who are receiving unemployment benefits to do unpaid work is a complex one, with valid arguments on both sides. While it is true that with rights come obligations, it is also important to consider the implications of such a policy. It is crucial to ensure that any policy that is implemented is fair, practical, and beneficial to all parties involved. It is also important to keep in mind that those who are unemployed are not receiving benefits out of choice, but out of necessity and any policy should not be used as a punishment for unemployment. Rather, it should provide support for the unemployed to get back to employment and to help them to contribute to their communities in a meaningful way.",1
417,0197.a2.txt,Effects of writing,"Writing is an essential part of human communication and has played a crucial role in the development of human civilization. It has the power to convey thoughts, ideas, and emotions in a way that is not possible through spoken language alone. The effects of writing are far-reaching and can be seen in various aspects of our lives, including education, mental health, and personal development. In this essay, I will explore the effects of writing and how it can be used to improve our lives.

One of the most obvious effects of writing is its role in education. Writing is a fundamental skill that is taught in schools and is essential for academic success. It allows students to express their thoughts and ideas in a clear and organized manner, which is crucial for success in any field. Writing also helps students to develop critical thinking skills, as they must evaluate and analyze information before they can write about it. Furthermore, writing is a great tool for students to practice their creativity and imagination.

Writing also has a positive effect on mental health. It is a form of self-expression and can be used as a therapeutic tool for individuals dealing with stress, anxiety, and depression. Writing about one's thoughts and feelings can help to process and understand them better. Additionally, it can be a way to explore emotions and experiences that are difficult to express verbally.

Another benefit of writing is that it can be used as a means of personal development. Writing about one's goals and aspirations can help to clarify them and make them more tangible. Additionally, writing in a journal can be a powerful tool for reflection and introspection. It can provide an opportunity to examine one's thoughts and actions, and to learn from past experiences.

Writing also has important social effects. It allows people to connect with others in a way that is not possible through spoken language alone. Writing can be used to create a sense of community and belonging, as well as to share information and knowledge with others. Furthermore, writing has been a powerful tool for social and political change throughout history, as it has been used to spread ideas, mobilize movements, and effect change.

However, it is important to note that the effects of writing can be negative as well as positive. Writing can also be used as a weapon to spread misinformation, propaganda, or hate speech. Additionally, excessive use of social media and the internet can lead to a decrease in attention span and critical thinking skills. Therefore, it is important to use writing in a responsible and thoughtful manner.

In conclusion, writing is a powerful tool that has far-reaching effects on various aspects of our lives. It plays a crucial role in education, mental health, personal development, and social change. Writing allows us to express our thoughts and ideas in a clear and organized manner, and provides an opportunity for personal reflection and growth.

The E4 is one of the most important transportation routes in the country, connecting many of the major cities and towns in the north of Sweden. However, the E4 also has a significant impact on the environment, economy, and society of Uppland and Uppsala, which will be the focus of this essay.

The E4 plays a significant role in the economy of Uppland and Uppsala, as it is a major transportation route for goods and services. The highway connects the region to the rest of the country, making it easier for businesses to transport their products and for people to access goods and services. Additionally, the E4 also brings tourists to the area, which can be beneficial for the local economy. However, the E4 also has negative effects on the economy, such as increased competition for local businesses, and increased traffic can lead to congestion and delays, which can make it difficult for businesses to operate efficiently.

The E4 also has a significant impact on the environment of Uppland and Uppsala. The construction and maintenance of the highway require the use of natural resources and can lead to the destruction of natural habitats. The increased traffic on the E4 also leads to air and noise pollution, which can have negative effects on the health and well-being of the local population. Additionally, the E4 can also make it difficult for wildlife to move through the area, which can lead to a decline in biodiversity.

The E4 also has an impact on the society of Uppland and Uppsala. The highway divides the region into two, making it more difficult for people to access services and amenities on the other side. Additionally, the increased traffic on the E4 can lead to congestion and delays, which can make it difficult for people to get to work or school on time. The E4 can also make it difficult for people to access public transportation, which can lead to a reliance on private cars, and contribute to traffic congestion. Furthermore, the E4 can make it difficult for people to access recreational areas and natural habitats, which can have negative effects on their physical and mental health.

In conclusion, the European Highway four, or E4, plays a significant role in the Uppland region and the city of Uppsala. The E4 is a major transportation route that connects the region to the rest of the country and brings economic benefits. However, it also has negative effects on the environment, economy, and society of Uppland and Uppsala. It is important to consider these negative effects and to take steps to mitigate them, such as investing in public transportation, promoting sustainable forms of transportation, and preserving natural habitats.

419,0199.a2.txt,Work in return of unemployment benefit,"The idea of requiring people who are receiving unemployment benefits to work in return for those benefits has been a topic of debate for many years. On one hand, some argue that people who are receiving benefits should be required to give back to their communities and that work requirements would encourage individuals to actively seek employment. On the other hand, others argue that work requirements would be a form of exploitation and that those who are unemployed should not be forced to work for free. In this essay, I will explore the arguments for and against requiring work in return for unemployment benefits, and consider the implications of such a policy.

One of the main arguments in favor of requiring work in return for unemployment benefits is that it would encourage individuals to actively seek employment. Unemployment benefits are intended to provide temporary financial assistance to those who are out of work, but some argue that they can become a form of dependency and discourage individuals from seeking employment. Work requirements would ensure that individuals are actively searching for work and taking steps to improve their employability.

Another argument in favor of work requirements is that it would help to reduce the costs of unemployment benefits. Unemployment benefits are paid for by taxpayers, and many believe that those who are receiving these benefits should be required to do something in return. Work requirements would help to offset some of the costs of these benefits, and would also reduce the number of people who are reliant on unemployment benefits.

Additionally, work requirements would also provide opportunities for individuals to gain new skills and experiences that could help them to find employment. Many unemployed individuals have limited work experience and may have difficulty finding employment due to a lack of skills and qualifications. Work requirements would provide an opportunity for individuals to gain experience and skills in a supportive environment, which would help to improve their employability.

However, there are also valid arguments against requiring work in return for unemployment benefits. One of the main concerns is that it would be a form of exploitation. Unemployed individuals are already in a vulnerable situation, and requiring them to work for free would only add to their difficulties.

420,0200.a2.txt,THERE IS STILL TIME TO LEAVE THE EU,"The question of whether Sweden should leave the European Union (EU) has been a topic of debate for many years. The EU is a political and economic union of 27 European countries that work together to promote peace and stability in Europe. Sweden joined the EU in 1995, but since then, there have been calls for the country to leave the union. In this essay, I will explore the arguments for and against Sweden leaving the EU, and consider the implications of such a decision.

One of the main arguments for Sweden leaving the EU is that it would regain control of its own laws and regulations. As a member of the EU, Sweden is subject to the laws and regulations of the EU, which means that some decisions that would normally be made by the Swedish government are now made at the EU level. This has led to concerns that Sweden's ability to govern itself has been diminished. Additionally, leaving the EU would allow Sweden to make its own trade deals with other countries, rather than being bound by the EU's trade agreements.

Another argument for leaving the EU is that it would reduce the financial costs of being a member. Sweden, like all other EU member states, is required to make contributions to the EU budget. These contributions are used to fund various EU projects and initiatives, such as the Common Agricultural Policy and the European Regional Development Fund. While these contributions are not insignificant, some argue that the benefits of EU membership do not outweigh the costs.

Additionally, leaving the EU would also allow Sweden to have more control over its immigration policy. The EU's freedom of movement principle allows citizens of EU member states to live and work in other EU countries without restrictions. This has led to concerns about the impact of immigration on Sweden's welfare system and labor market.

However, there are also strong arguments against Sweden leaving the EU. One of the main concerns is that it would harm the country's economy. The EU is the world's largest market, and being a member allows Swedish companies to access this market without tariffs or trade barriers. This has led to increased exports and economic growth for the country. Additionally, leaving the EU would also make it more difficult for Swedish companies to access the EU market, which would harm their competitiveness.

The Royal Family is a hereditary monarchy that has traditionally been the head of state, while democracy is a system of government in which power is held by the people. In this essay, I will explore the relationship between the Royal Family and democracy, and consider the role that the Royal Family plays in a democratic society.

One of the main ways in which the Royal Family and democracy intersect is through the role of the monarchy as a symbol of national unity. The Royal Family serves as a unifying symbol for the country, representing its history, culture, and values. This can be especially important in a democratic society, where different groups and individuals may have competing interests and perspectives. The Royal Family can help to bring these different groups together and create a sense of shared identity and purpose.

Additionally, the Royal Family can play a role in promoting democracy by serving as a figurehead for the country. The monarchy is a non-partisan institution and the monarch is expected to remain neutral in political matters. This allows the monarch to serve as a symbol of continuity and stability, which can be important in a democratic society where political leaders come and go. The monarch can also be a symbol of national unity, which can help to promote stability and continuity.

The Royal Family can also play a role in promoting democracy by serving as a symbol of national identity. The Royal Family can serve as a symbol of national pride and unity, which can be especially important in a democratic society where different groups and individuals may have competing interests and perspectives. The Royal Family can help to bring these different groups together and create a sense of shared identity and purpose, which can be important for the stability of democratic society.

However, there are also ways in which the Royal Family can be seen as a potential hindrance to democracy. The monarchy is not elected by the people and can hold a great deal of power and influence. This can lead to concerns about the lack of accountability and transparency in the way that the Royal Family operates. Additionally, the Royal Family is not subject to the same checks and balances as elected officials, which can lead to concerns about the abuse of power.

In conclusion, the relationship between the Royal Family and democracy can be complex and nuanced. On one hand, the Royal Family can serve as a symbol of national unity, continuity, and identity, which can be important in a democratic society. However, the monarchy is not elected by the people, which can lead to concerns about the lack of accountability and transparency in the way that the Royal Family operates. It's important to consider the role of the Royal Family in a democratic society and to ensure that it operates in a way that is consistent with democratic principles. This can be achieved through clear constitutional boundaries, transparency and accountability in the Royal Family's actions and activities, and by ensuring that the Royal Family serves as a unifying symbol for the country, rather than a divisive one.",1
422,0202.a2.txt,Knowledge costs,"Knowledge costs refer to the financial and non-financial costs associated with acquiring and using knowledge. These costs can be incurred by individuals, businesses, and society as a whole, and can have a significant impact on economic growth and development. In this essay, I will explore the different types of knowledge costs, and consider the ways in which they can be minimized.

One of the most obvious types of knowledge costs is the cost of education. This includes the costs of attending school, college, or university, as well as the costs of materials, books, and equipment. These costs can be significant, especially for students from low-income families or for those who are paying for their own education. Additionally, there are also costs associated with continuing education and professional development, which can be important for individuals to maintain their competitiveness in the job market.

Another type of knowledge cost is the cost of research and development (R&D). This includes the costs of conducting scientific research, developing new technologies, and creating new products and services. These costs can be significant for businesses, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that may not have the resources to invest in R&D. Additionally, there are also costs associated with protecting intellectual property, such as patents and trademarks, which can be important for businesses to protect their investments in R&D.

A third type of knowledge cost is the cost of information and communication technology (ICT). This includes the costs of purchasing and maintaining hardware and software, as well as the costs of training and support. These costs can be significant for businesses, especially for those that rely on ICT to conduct their operations. Additionally, there are also costs associated with protecting against cyber threats, such as data breaches and hacking, which can be important for businesses to protect their sensitive information.

Finally, there are also social costs associated with knowledge. These include the costs of inequality and social exclusion, which can result from a lack of access to education, R&D, and ICT. These costs can be significant for society as a whole, as they can lead to a lack of economic growth and development, as well as social unrest.

In conclusion, knowledge costs can be significant for individuals, businesses, and society as a whole. These costs can include the cost of education, R&D, ICT, and social costs associated with inequality and social exclusion. To minimize these costs, it is important to invest in education, R&D, and ICT, as well as to ensure that these resources are accessible to all.

In this essay, I will explore the ways in which becoming a teacher can enrich one's life, and consider the benefits of this rewarding career choice.

One of the most obvious ways in which becoming a teacher can enrich one's life is through the opportunity to make a positive impact on the lives of others. Teachers have the ability to inspire, motivate, and guide their students, and to be a part of shaping their academic and personal development. Additionally, teachers can also make a positive impact on the broader community by promoting literacy and education, and by fostering a love of learning.

Another way in which becoming a teacher can enrich one's life is through personal growth and professional development.

424,0204.a2.txt,BREAKING THE LAW,"Breaking the law refers to the act of violating a legal rule or statute. Laws are put in place by governments to maintain order and protect citizens' rights, and breaking them can lead to severe consequences. In this essay, I will explore the reasons why people might break the law, and the consequences of doing so.

One of the main reasons why people might break the law is due to financial difficulties. Financial struggles can lead individuals to turn to illegal activities such as theft, embezzlement, or fraud as a means of obtaining money. Additionally, some individuals may also be driven to breaking the law due to a lack of job opportunities or a lack of education and skills.

Another reason why people might break the law is due to a lack of understanding or knowledge of the law. For example, an individual may not be aware that their actions are illegal, or they may not understand the implications of breaking the law. Additionally, individuals may also break the law due to a lack of awareness of their rights and the legal system.

Another reason why people might break the law is due to a lack of social support or a lack of positive role models. Growing up in a difficult or unstable environment can make it more likely for individuals to engage in criminal behavior. Additionally, being exposed to criminal behavior in one's community can normalize such behavior, and make it more likely for individuals to break the law.

However, breaking the law can have severe consequences. Legal penalties for breaking the law can include fines, imprisonment, and a criminal record, which can have long-term consequences for an individual's personal and professional life. Additionally, breaking the law can also lead to a loss of trust and respect from friends, family, and the community. Furthermore, breaking the law can also cause harm to others and can have a negative impact on the community.

In conclusion, breaking the law can have serious consequences for individuals and society. Laws are put in place to maintain order and protect citizens' rights, and breaking them can lead to severe penalties. However, it is important to understand that individuals may break the law due to a range of factors, such as financial difficulties, a lack of understanding or knowledge of the law, or a lack of social support and positive role models. Therefore, addressing the underlying issues that lead to criminal behavior can help to reduce the number of individuals who break the law and prevent recidivism. Furthermore, providing education, job opportunities, and support to individuals who have broken the law can help them to reintegrate into society and avoid breaking the law in the future.",1
425,0205.a2.txt,"SHOULD ""SOFT DRUGS"" BE LEGALISED?","The question of whether ""soft drugs"" such as marijuana should be legalized has been a topic of debate for many years. Supporters of legalization argue that it would bring about a range of benefits, including reducing crime, increasing tax revenue, and improving public health. However, opponents argue that legalization would lead to increased drug use and associated problems, and would send the wrong message to society. In this essay, I will explore the arguments for and against legalizing ""soft drugs"" and consider the potential implications of such a decision.

One of the main arguments in favor of legalizing ""soft drugs"" is that it would reduce crime. Currently, the possession, sale, and distribution of ""soft drugs"" is illegal, and this has led to a significant amount of criminal activity. By legalizing ""soft drugs,"" the black market for these drugs would be eliminated, and criminal organizations would no longer profit from their sale. Additionally, individuals who are currently criminalized for possessing or using ""soft drugs"" would no longer be at risk of arrest and imprisonment, reducing the burden on the criminal justice system.

Another argument in favor of legalizing ""soft drugs"" is that it would increase tax revenue. By legalizing ""soft drugs,"" they could be taxed and regulated in a similar way to alcohol and tobacco. This would provide a new source of revenue for governments, which could be used to fund public services such as healthcare and education. Additionally, regulation would also make it easier to control the quality and safety of the drugs, reducing the risk of harm to the public.

Additionally, the legalization of ""soft drugs"" would also have public health benefits. Currently, individuals who use ""soft drugs"" may be at risk of arrest and imprisonment, which can have a detrimental effect on their health and well-being. By legalizing ""soft drugs,"" individuals would no longer have to fear arrest and imprisonment, and could access the drugs more easily, reducing the risk of harm. Additionally, legalization would also make it easier for individuals to access information about the drugs and their effects, which would enable them to make more informed decisions about their use.

However, there are also strong arguments against legalizing ""soft drugs."" One of the main concerns is that it would lead to increased drug use and associated problems. Supporters of legalization argue that the criminalization of ""soft drugs"" does not prevent drug use, but rather drives it underground. However, opponents argue that legalization would send the message that drug use is acceptable, and this would lead to increased drug use and associated problems such as addiction and crime.

Another concern is that legalization would send the wrong message to society. Opponents argue that legalization would send the message that drug use is acceptable, and this would lead to increased drug use and associated problems. Additionally, legalization could also lead to increased access to drugs for young people, which could have negative consequences for their health and well-being.

In conclusion, the question of whether ""soft drugs"" should be legalized is a complex and nuanced one. Supporters argue that legalization would bring about a range of benefits, including reducing crime, increasing tax revenue, and improving public health.

It's important to consider the potential implications of legalization, and weigh the pros and cons of such a decision. Ultimately, whether or not to legalize ""soft drugs"" is a decision that should be based on careful consideration of all the available evidence and the potential consequences.",1
426,0207.a2.txt,The school grade system in Sweden,"The school grade system in Sweden is a system used to evaluate the performance of students in primary and secondary education. It is based on a scale of 1-5, with 1 being the lowest grade and 5 being the highest. The grade system is used to evaluate students' performance in a variety of subjects, including mathematics, science, and languages. In this essay, I will explore the school grade system in Sweden and consider its strengths and weaknesses.

One of the strengths of the school grade system in Sweden is that it provides a clear and straightforward way for students and teachers to evaluate performance. The 1-5 scale is easy to understand and allows for clear communication between students, teachers, and parents about a student's progress. Additionally, the system allows for a detailed analysis of student performance, making it easy for teachers to identify areas where a student may be struggling and to provide targeted support.

Another strength of the school grade system in Sweden is that it allows for a fair and objective evaluation of student performance. The system is based on standardized tests, which are designed to be free from bias and to accurately measure student performance. Additionally, the system is based on a norm-referenced approach, which means that student performance is evaluated in relation to the performance of their peers. This helps to ensure that students are not unfairly penalized for factors outside of their control, such as socioeconomic status or ethnicity.

Additionally, the school grade system in Sweden is also flexible. Schools can choose to use grades or not and it's not a requirement. The system allows for a variety of assessment methods, including traditional exams, essays, and projects, which allows teachers to evaluate a wide range of student abilities and skills. This flexibility makes the system more inclusive and helps to ensure that all students have an opportunity to succeed.

However, there are also weaknesses of the school grade system in Sweden. One of the main weaknesses is that it can put a lot of pressure on students, especially those who are struggling academically. The system can be stressful for students, and it can be difficult for them to cope with the pressure of performing well on standardized tests. Additionally, the system can be stressful for teachers, who may feel pressure to achieve high test scores in order to meet the expectations of the school, parents, and the government.

Another weakness of the school grade system in Sweden is that it can be rigid and inflexible. The system is based on standardized tests, which may not accurately reflect a student's true abilities and skills. Additionally, the system does not take into account factors such as a student's individual learning style, which can lead to a student being unfairly penalized for factors outside of their control. Furthermore, the system may not take into account the different needs of students from different backgrounds, cultures, or socioeconomic status.

In conclusion, the school grade system in Sweden is a system used to evaluate the performance of students in primary and secondary education. It has its strengths such as providing a clear, objective and fair way to evaluate student performance, flexibility, and detailed analysis. However, it also has its weaknesses such",1

It provides both physical and mental benefits, and can be a way to improve one's overall health and well-being. In this essay, I will explore the reasons why practicing martial arts is beneficial and consider the different forms of martial arts and their unique benefits.

One of the main reasons why practicing martial arts is beneficial is that it provides a form of physical exercise. Martial arts involve a combination of cardio and strength training, which can help to improve cardiovascular health, increase muscle tone, and burn calories. Additionally, martial arts also provide a form of functional fitness, which means that the movements and techniques practiced in martial arts can be applied to everyday life, such as carrying groceries or climbing stairs.

Another reason why practicing martial arts is beneficial is that it provides a way to improve mental health. Martial arts involve a lot of focus and discipline, which can help to improve concentration, memory and overall cognitive function. Additionally, martial arts can also help to reduce stress and anxiety, as the physical activity and focus on breathing can act as a form of meditation. Furthermore, martial arts also provide a sense of community and belonging, as students train and learn together.

Additionally, practicing martial arts can also be a way to improve self-defense skills. Martial arts such as karate, boxing, taekwondo, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu provide training in techniques to defend oneself in case of an attack. This can provide a sense of security and confidence, especially for women, children and the elderly, who may feel vulnerable in certain situations.

Furthermore, martial arts also provide a way to improve self-esteem, self-discipline, and self-control. Martial arts involve a lot of repetition and practice, which can help to build discipline, focus and perseverance. Additionally, martial arts also provide a sense of accomplishment and progress, as students work to improve their techniques and advance through the ranks. This can help to boost self-esteem and self-confidence.

428,0209.a2.txt,Homosexual couples right to adopt children,"The issue of whether or not homosexual couples should have the right to adopt children has been a topic of debate for many years. Supporters argue that same-sex couples are just as capable of providing a loving and nurturing home for a child as opposite-sex couples, and that denying them the right to adopt is discriminatory. Opponents argue that children need both a mother and a father, and that same-sex couples cannot provide the same environment as a traditional family. In this essay, I will explore the arguments for and against the adoption rights of homosexual couples and consider the potential implications of such a decision.

One of the main arguments in favor of allowing homosexual couples to adopt is that it would provide more loving and stable homes for children. There are many children in need of loving homes, and same-sex couples are just as capable of providing a stable and nurturing environment as opposite-sex couples. Additionally, studies have shown that children raised by same-sex couples are just as well-adjusted and healthy as those raised by opposite-sex couples. Denying same-sex couples the right to adopt is therefore discriminatory and unjust.

Another argument in favor of allowing homosexual couples to adopt is that it would promote diversity and inclusion. By allowing same-sex couples to adopt, society would be sending a message that all families are valued and respected, regardless of their composition. This would promote greater understanding and acceptance of diversity in society, and would help to reduce discrimination and prejudice against same-sex couples.

Additionally, allowing same-sex couples to adopt would also help to reduce the number of children in foster care. There is a shortage of adoptive families, and many children are spending prolonged periods in foster care as a result. By allowing same-sex couples to adopt, more children would have the opportunity to be placed in loving, stable homes, which would improve their chances of growing up to be healthy and well-adjusted adults.

However, there are also arguments against allowing homosexual couples to adopt. One of the main concerns is that children need both a mother and a father to have the best possible outcome. Opponents argue that children raised by same-sex couples will be at a disadvantage because they will not have the opportunity to learn from and be influenced by both male and female role models. Additionally, they argue that same-sex couples are not able to provide the same environment as a traditional family, and that children would be better off being raised by opposite-sex couples.

Another concern is that allowing same-sex couples to adopt would go against traditional family values. Opponents argue that traditional family values are under attack, and that allowing same-sex couples to adopt would be another step in the wrong direction. Additionally, they argue that allowing same-sex couples to adopt would send a",1

It not only benefits the body by improving physical fitness, but also has positive effects on mental health and cognitive function. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of exercise on both the body and mind, and discuss the importance of incorporating regular physical activity into one's daily routine.

One of the most obvious benefits of exercise is its ability to improve physical fitness. Regular physical activity can help to increase muscle tone, improve cardiovascular health, and aid in weight management. Additionally, exercise can also help to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and some types of cancer. Regular exercise also promotes better sleep, improves bone density, and can improve overall physical function and mobility.

In addition to its physical benefits, exercise also has positive effects on mental health. Regular physical activity can help to reduce stress, anxiety and depression. Exercise releases endorphins, also known as “feel-good” chemicals, which can improve mood, reduce feelings of anxiety and depression, and help to promote overall emotional well-being. Additionally, exercise can also help to improve self-esteem and self-confidence.

Exercise also provides cognitive benefits. Regular physical activity can help to improve memory, concentration, and cognitive function. Research suggests that regular exercise can help to increase the size of the hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for memory and learning. Additionally, exercise can also help to reduce the risk of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults.

Exercise can be done in many forms, from traditional activities such as running, swimming, and weightlifting to less traditional forms such as dancing, yoga, and martial arts. A combination of aerobic and strength training is the best approach for overall health benefits. Aerobic activities such as running, cycling and swimming are good for cardiovascular health, whereas strength training such as weightlifting, bodyweight exercises and resistance training helps to build muscle and increase bone density.

The key to reaping the benefits of exercise is consistency. It's recommended to aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week. Additionally, two days per week of muscle-strengthening activities that work all major muscle groups should be included in one's physical activity routine.

In conclusion, exercise is an essential aspect of overall health and well-being. Regular physical activity provides numerous benefits for the body and mind, including improved physical fitness, reduced risk of chronic disease, and improved mental health. Incorporating regular exercise into one's daily routine is crucial for maintaining overall health and well-being.

430,0214.a2.txt,Why Sweden should have a wild wolf strain,"The question of whether or not Sweden should have a wild wolf strain has been a topic of debate for many years. Supporters argue that the wolf is an important part of Sweden's natural heritage and biodiversity, and that reintroducing the species would have many ecological, economic, and cultural benefits. Opponents argue that the wolf is a dangerous predator that poses a threat to domestic animals and human safety, and that reintroducing the species would have many negative consequences. In this essay, I will explore the arguments for and against reintroducing a wild wolf strain in Sweden and consider the potential implications of such a decision.

One of the main arguments in favor of reintroducing a wild wolf strain in Sweden is that it would help to restore the balance of nature. Wolves play an important role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems by controlling populations of ungulates, such as deer and elk, which can overpopulate and damage their habitats. Additionally, reintroducing wolves would help to restore the natural food chain and improve biodiversity in the region.

Another argument in favor of reintroducing a wild wolf strain in Sweden is that it would provide economic benefits. Wolves can attract tourists and wildlife enthusiasts, who are willing to pay to see and learn about the species. Additionally, reintroducing wolves can also help to reduce the damage to forests and agriculture caused by overpopulated ungulates, which would save money for farmers and forest owners.

Additionally, reintroducing a wild wolf strain in Sweden would also have cultural benefits. Wolves have been a part of the cultural heritage of Sweden for centuries, and their absence has left a void in the country's natural heritage. Reintroducing the species would help to restore a sense of connection to the country's natural history, and provide educational opportunities for future generations to learn about the importance of preserving biodiversity.

However, there are also arguments against reintroducing a wild wolf strain in Sweden. One of the main concerns is that the wolf is a dangerous predator that poses a threat to domestic animals and human safety. Wolves can prey on livestock, and their presence could result in economic losses for farmers. Additionally, some people fear for their safety when living in close proximity to wolves, and may want to avoid such contact.

Another concern is that reintroducing a wild wolf strain in Sweden would be too costly. Restoring and protecting habitats for wolves, as well as compensating farmers for any losses, can be costly. Additionally, there are also concerns about the potential negative impact on other wildlife and the potential conflicts with human activities such as hunting and forestry.

In conclusion, the question of whether or not Sweden should reintroduce a wild wolf strain is a complex and nuanced one. Supporters argue that reintroducing",1

In this essay, I will explore why exercise is important for older adults and discuss the benefits it can provide.

One of the most important benefits of exercise for older adults is that it helps to maintain and improve physical function. As we age, our muscles and bones can become weaker, making it more difficult to perform everyday tasks. Regular exercise can help to maintain muscle mass, improve bone density, and increase flexibility and balance, which can reduce the risk of falls and injuries. Additionally, regular physical activity can also help to improve cardiovascular health, which can reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.

Another important benefit of exercise for older adults is that it can help to improve mental health. Regular physical activity can help to reduce stress, anxiety and depression, which are common problems among older adults. Exercise releases endorphins, which are chemicals that can help to improve mood and reduce feelings of anxiety and depression. Additionally, regular exercise can also help to improve cognitive function, including memory, concentration, and overall mental acuity.

Exercise also has social benefits for older adults. Regular physical activity can help to improve social connections and reduce feelings of isolation and loneliness. Furthermore, older adults who participate in regular physical activity may have a greater sense of self-worth, self-esteem, and self-confidence. This can lead to greater independence and a better overall quality of life.

Exercise can be done in many forms, and older adults can choose the type of physical activity that they enjoy and feel comfortable with. Aerobic activities such as walking, cycling, swimming, and dancing are good for cardiovascular health, whereas strength training such as weightlifting, bodyweight exercises, and resistance training helps to build muscle and increase bone density. Yoga, tai chi, and other forms of low-impact physical activity can help to improve balance and flexibility.

The key to reaping the benefits of exercise is consistency. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that older adults engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week. Additionally, two days per week of muscle-strengthening activities that work all major muscle groups should be included in one's physical activity routine.

In conclusion, regular physical activity is essential for older adults to maintain and improve their overall health and well-being. Exercise can help to improve physical function, mental health, and social connections, which can lead to a better quality of life.

432,0216.a2.txt,NA,"The idea of requiring unemployed individuals to do unpaid work has been a topic of debate for many years. Supporters argue that unpaid work can provide valuable skills and experience for unemployed individuals, and that it can help to reduce the burden on government welfare programs. Opponents argue that unpaid work is a form of exploitation and that it is unfair to expect individuals who are already struggling to make ends meet to work for no pay. In this essay, I will explore the arguments for and against requiring unemployed individuals to do unpaid work and consider the potential implications of such a decision.

One of the main arguments in favor of requiring unemployed individuals to do unpaid work is that it can provide valuable skills and experience. Many unemployed individuals may not have current or recent work experience, and unpaid work can provide an opportunity for them to gain new skills and improve their chances of finding paid employment in the future. Additionally, unpaid work can also provide a sense of purpose and self-worth for individuals who may be struggling with feelings of hopelessness or helplessness.

Another argument in favor of requiring unemployed individuals to do unpaid work is that it can help to reduce the burden on government welfare programs. Unemployment benefits and other forms of government assistance can be costly, and requiring unemployed individuals to do unpaid work can help to reduce the overall cost of these programs. Additionally, unpaid work can also help to reduce the number of individuals who are dependent on government assistance, which can help to reduce the overall burden on taxpayers.

However, there are also arguments against requiring unemployed individuals to do unpaid work. One of the main concerns is that unpaid work is a form of exploitation, and that it is unfair to expect individuals who are already struggling to make ends meet to work for no pay. Additionally, unpaid work can also be seen as a form of punishment for being unemployed, which can be discouraging and demotivating for individuals who are already struggling.

Another concern is that requiring unemployed individuals to do unpaid work can be detrimental to their mental and physical health. Unemployment can already be a source of stress and anxiety, and adding the added pressure of unpaid work can exacerbate these problems. Additionally, unpaid work can also be physically demanding, and individuals who are already struggling to make ends meet may not be able to afford to take time off work if they become ill.

In conclusion, the idea of requiring unemployed individuals to do unpaid work is a complex and nuanced one. Supporters argue that unpaid work can provide valuable skills and experience and can help to reduce the burden on government welfare programs. However, opponents argue that unpaid work is a form of exploitation and can be detrimental to the mental and physical health of unemployed individuals.

The elderly population is growing and with it comes the challenge of providing adequate healthcare, social services and support. In this essay, I will explore the challenges that the elderly population poses for the state and discuss potential solutions to these issues.

One of the main challenges that the elderly population poses for the state is the increasing cost of healthcare. As people age, they become more susceptible to chronic health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, which can be costly to treat. Additionally, the elderly population also requires more frequent and specialized medical care, which can further increase healthcare costs. Governments need to find ways to provide affordable and accessible healthcare to the elderly population while also ensuring that the costs do not become overwhelming for the state.

Another challenge that the elderly population poses for the state is the need for social services and support. As people age, they may become more dependent on assistance with daily tasks such as cooking, cleaning, and transportation. Additionally, the elderly population may also require specialized services such as home healthcare and nursing home care. Governments need to find ways to provide these services and support to the elderly population without placing undue burden on the state.

Additionally, the elderly population may also pose a challenge for the state in terms of economic and labor force participation. As the elderly population grows, it could lead to a decrease in the number of people participating in the labor force, which can affect economic growth. Additionally, the elderly population may also place a greater burden on the state's pension and retirement systems, which can also have an impact on the economy. Governments need to find ways to address these challenges and ensure that the elderly population can continue to contribute to the economy.

One potential solution to the challenges that the elderly population poses for the state is to increase investment in healthcare and social services. Governments can invest in programs and services that provide affordable and accessible healthcare to the elderly population, as well as programs that provide social support and assistance with daily tasks. Additionally, governments can also invest in programs that provide training and education to healthcare providers to ensure that they are equipped to care for the elderly population.

Another potential solution is to increase investment in technology and innovation. This can help to reduce the costs of healthcare for the elderly population, as well as improve the efficiency and effectiveness of social services and support. Additionally, governments can also invest in programs that promote the development of new technologies and innovations that can help to improve the lives of the elderly population.

In conclusion, the issue of how to care for the elderly population is an important one for governments around the world. The elderly population poses a number of challenges for the state, including the increasing cost of healthcare, the need for social services and support, and the potential impact on the economy. Governments need to find ways to address these challenges and provide affordable and accessible healthcare, social services, and support to the elderly population. Additionally, governments should also invest in technology and innovation to improve the lives of the elderly population.",1
434,0219.a2.txt,MOBILE TELEPHONES: a disturbing invention,"Mobile telephones, also known as smartphones, have become an integral part of our daily lives. They have revolutionized the way we communicate, access information, and conduct business. However, there are also concerns that mobile telephones can be a disturbing invention, and that they can have negative impacts on our health, relationships, and society as a whole. In this essay, I will explore the concerns about mobile telephones and discuss the potential negative impacts they can have.

One of the main concerns about mobile telephones is the impact they can have on our physical health. The prolonged use of mobile telephones can cause eye strain, headaches, and neck and back pain. Additionally, the blue light emitted by mobile telephones can disrupt our circadian rhythm and disrupt our sleep patterns, leading to insomnia and other sleep disorders. There are also concerns that the radiation emitted by mobile phones may be linked to cancer and other health issues, though more research is needed to confirm this.

Another concern about mobile telephones is the impact they can have on our mental health. The constant use of mobile telephones can lead to addiction, which can affect our ability to form meaningful relationships, and can lead to social isolation. Additionally, the constant access to social media and the internet can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. Furthermore, the constant need to be connected and online can also lead to burnout, reducing productivity and well-being.

Mobile telephones can also have a negative impact on our relationships. The constant use of mobile telephones can lead to distraction and disconnection from the people around us. Additionally, the constant access to social media and the internet can lead to the comparison of one's life with the curated and filtered lives of others, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction with one's own life. Furthermore, the constant use of mobile telephones can also lead to a lack of privacy and the erosion of personal boundaries.

Mobile telephones can also have a negative impact on society as a whole. The constant use of mobile telephones can lead to decreased attention spans and an inability to focus on one task for an extended period of time. Additionally, the constant access to the internet and social media can lead to the spread of misinformation and fake news, which can have a negative impact on democracy and the ability to make informed decisions. Furthermore, the constant use of mobile telephones can also lead to the erosion of public space and the loss of face-to-face communication skills.

To mitigate the negative impacts of mobile telephones, it's important to use them in a responsible and mindful way. One way to do this is to set limits on the amount of time spent on mobile telephones, and to be conscious of the amount of time spent on social media and the internet. Additionally, it's important to take regular breaks from mobile telephones and to engage in activities that do not involve the use",1
435,0221.a2.txt,Use your brain use a helmet,"The use of helmets is a crucial aspect of safety when engaging in activities such as cycling, skateboarding, skiing, snowboarding and more. Head injuries are among the most severe injuries that can occur during accidents, and helmets can significantly reduce the risk of such injuries. In this essay, I will explore the importance of using helmets and discuss the potential consequences of not wearing one.

One of the main reasons why helmets are important is that they can greatly reduce the risk of head injuries. The brain is one of the most sensitive and vital organs in the body, and any injury to it can have serious and long-lasting consequences. Helmets are designed to absorb the impact of a collision and distribute the force over a larger area, which can prevent serious head injuries such as skull fractures, brain bleeds and concussions. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, helmets are estimated to reduce the risk of head injuries by 50%.

Another reason why helmets are important is that they can save lives. Head injuries are a leading cause of death and disability in accidents, and helmets can greatly reduce the risk of such injuries. In fact, the National Safety Council estimates that helmets can reduce the risk of death in a motorcycle accident by 37%.

Helmets are also important for children, as their brains are still developing and are more vulnerable to injury. Children are more likely to engage in risky behaviors and less likely to understand the importance of safety, which makes it essential for them to wear helmets when engaging in activities such as cycling, skateboarding, and other sports.

However, despite the clear benefits of helmets, many people still choose not to wear them. This can be due to a lack of education about the importance of helmets, as well as a lack of enforcement of helmet laws. Additionally, some people may feel that helmets are uncomfortable or restrictive, and may not want to wear them.

The consequences of not wearing a helmet can be severe. Without a helmet, the risk of serious head injuries and death increases significantly. Additionally, not wearing a helmet can also result in financial consequences, such as medical bills and lost wages due to injury. Furthermore, not wearing a helmet can also have legal consequences, as many states have laws mandating the use of helmets for certain activities.

To conclude, the use of helmets is a crucial aspect of safety when engaging in activities such as cycling, skateboarding, skiing, snowboarding and more. Helmets can greatly reduce the risk of head injuries and save lives. It's important for individuals to understand the importance of helmets and to make a conscious decision to wear one when engaging in these activities. Governments can also play a role by enforcing helmet laws and educating the public about the importance of helmets. By using our brains and wearing a helmet",1
436,0222.a2.txt,Whay do not people listen?,"Listening is a fundamental aspect of communication, yet many people struggle with truly listening to others. There can be various reasons why people do not listen, including distractions, lack of interest, and a lack of empathy. In this essay, I will explore some of the reasons why people may not listen and discuss the potential consequences of not listening.

One reason why people may not listen is distractions. In today's fast-paced and technology-driven world, people are constantly bombarded with distractions such as social media, notifications, and constant access to information. These distractions can make it difficult for people to focus and truly listen to others. Additionally, people may also be preoccupied with their own thoughts and concerns, which can make it difficult for them to fully engage in a conversation.

Another reason why people may not listen is a lack of interest. People may not be interested in the topic being discussed or may not consider the person speaking to be worth listening to. This can be due to factors such as bias, stereotypes, or past experiences with the person. Additionally, people may also be more focused on what they want to say rather than truly listening to others.

A lack of empathy can also be a reason why people may not listen. Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others, and without it, people may not be able to fully grasp the perspective and emotions of the person speaking. Additionally, people may also be more focused on themselves and their own experiences, which can make it difficult for them to truly understand and relate to others.

Not listening can have significant consequences. It can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, and poor communication. Additionally, not listening can also lead to a lack of trust and respect in relationships, both personal and professional. Furthermore, not listening can also lead to a lack of understanding and acceptance of different perspectives, which can lead to a lack of progress and growth in society.

To improve listening, individuals can practice active listening. This involves paying attention to the speaker, asking questions, and providing feedback. Additionally, individuals can also make an effort to put away distractions and focus on the conversation. Furthermore, individuals can also work on developing empathy, which can help to improve understanding and connection with others.

In conclusion, listening is a fundamental aspect of communication, yet many people struggle with truly listening to others. There can be various reasons why people do not listen, including distractions, lack of interest, and a lack of empathy. Not listening can have significant consequences and can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, and poor communication. To improve",1
437,0223.a2.txt,Why the selling of JAS to South Africa is such a step back for humanity,"The selling of JAS (Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile) to South Africa is a controversial issue that raises questions about the impact of arms sales on humanity. The JAS missile is a long-range, precision-guided missile designed for use in air-to-surface attacks. The sale of such weapons to any country, especially one with a history of human rights violations, raises serious concerns about the potential consequences for both the country receiving the weapons and the international community.

One reason why the sale of JAS to South Africa is seen as a step back for humanity is the potential for the weapon to be used in human rights violations. South Africa has a history of human rights violations, particularly during the apartheid era. The sale of weapons like the JAS missile to a country with such a history raises concerns about the potential for the weapon to be used against civilians or in other human rights abuses. Additionally, the sale of weapons like the JAS missile can also exacerbate conflicts and contribute to regional instability, which can lead to further human rights abuses.

Another reason why the sale of JAS to South Africa is seen as a step back for humanity is the potential impact on global security. The sale of weapons like the JAS missile can lead to an arms race and an increase in military spending, which can divert resources away from important social and economic programs. Additionally, the sale of weapons like the JAS missile can also contribute to regional tensions and conflicts, which can have a negative impact on global security.

Furthermore, the sale of JAS to South Africa can also have a negative impact on international relations, it can be seen as a breach of trust between countries, and it can also lead to sanctions and embargoes from other countries or international organizations, that can have negative effects on the economy and trade.

Another important aspect is the environmental impact of such weapons, The JAS missile is a long-range, precision-guided missile which is designed for use in air-to-surface attacks, these attacks can cause significant damage to the environment and wildlife, and it can also contaminate the air and water sources, which can have negative effects on human health.

In conclusion, the sale of JAS to South Africa is a controversial issue that raises serious concerns about the potential impact on humanity. The sale of weapons like the JAS missile can lead to human rights violations, regional instability, negative impact on global security, international relations, and the environment.

438,0224.a2.txt,"As for the prisoners using Lars Nor√©n to reach out with their nationalistic message, I do not agree. When they first contacted Lars Nor√©n they had no idea that he would write a play about them. In fact, it is Nor√©n who is using them. I believe that Nor√©n has written a play with the aim to reply Nazism on a personal level. In their discussions during the story, Nor√©n tries to get the prisoners aware of their views and that these do not correspond with his. Nor√©n also tries to show the prisoners that their opinions conflict with our fundamental laws and that this is why they are prisoners. The title 7:3 alludes to a legal paragraph which includes rules, leaves and the guarding of inmates who are thought to be likely to run away or devote themselves to crime during their time in prison.","Art and the Nazi regime have a complex and troubling history. The Nazi party, under the leadership of Adolf Hitler, rose to power in Germany in the 1930s and implemented policies that sought to create a pure Aryan race and suppress those deemed undesirable, including Jews, homosexuals, and people with disabilities. As part of this ideology, the Nazi regime also sought to control and manipulate art to promote their ideals and suppress opposing views.

One way in which the Nazi regime controlled art was through censorship and the suppression of certain artists and art forms. This included the removal of ""degenerate"" art, which the Nazis deemed to be un-German or racially impure, from museums and galleries. This included works by Jewish artists, as well as those associated with the modernist and avant-garde movements. In addition to censorship, the Nazi regime also promoted their own ideal of ""Aryan"" art, which glorified the supposed superior characteristics of the Aryan race and was intended to serve as propaganda.

Another way in which the Nazi regime controlled art was through the use of art as a tool for propaganda. The Nazi regime used art to promote their ideals and ideologies, such as the concept of a pure Aryan race and the supposed inferiority of certain groups. This included the use of art in public spaces, such as murals and sculptures, as well as in film and other media. These works often depicted the supposed strength and superiority of the Aryan race and were intended to create a sense of national pride and unity.

The Nazi regime also used art as a tool of persecution, particularly against Jewish artists. Many Jewish artists were forced to flee Germany or were arrested and sent to concentration camps. Others were forced to change their names or work in anonymity to avoid persecution. Some were even forced to change their styles or subject matter to fit the Nazi ideal of ""Aryan"" art. This led to the loss of many talented artists and their works, as well as a suppression of cultural diversity and freedom of expression.

The Nazi's also looted many works of art from Jewish collectors and museums, these artworks were then sent to museums in Germany and occupied territories, many of them were also sold or traded in international art markets, this was a violation of cultural property rights, and a crime against humanity.

The impact of the Nazi regime on art was devastating. Many artists and works were lost or suppressed, and the freedom of expression and cultural diversity were severely restricted. The legacy of the Nazi's art policies continues to be felt today, and the question of how to deal with the art that was created or acquired under the Nazi regime remains a complex and contentious issue.

In conclusion, the relationship between art and the Nazi regime is a complex and troubling one. The Nazi's used art as a tool of censorship, propaganda, and persecution, leading to",1
439,0227.a2.txt,The necessity of a Swedish national defence,"The concept of national defense is a crucial aspect of any country's security and sovereignty. It involves the protection of a country's citizens, borders, and interests from external threats. In the case of Sweden, the necessity of a national defense has been a topic of much debate in recent years. In this essay, I will explore the reasons why a national defense is necessary for Sweden and the potential consequences of not having one.

One of the main reasons for the necessity of a national defense in Sweden is to protect the country's citizens and borders from external threats. Sweden, like many other countries, is not immune to the threat of terrorism, cyber attacks, and other forms of aggression. A strong national defense can deter potential aggressors and protect the country from these threats. Additionally, a national defense can also help to protect Sweden's critical infrastructure, such as power plants and communication networks, which are vital for the functioning of the country.

Another reason for the necessity of a national defense in Sweden is to protect the country's interests and values. Sweden is a member of the European Union (EU) and a member of NATO's Partnership for Peace program, which means that the country has certain obligations to defend and protect EU and NATO interests. Additionally, Sweden is also a member of the United Nations (UN) and other international organizations, which can put the country at risk if these organizations are threatened. A national defense can help to protect Sweden's interests and values in these organizations, and contribute to the maintenance of peace and security in the world.

A national defense can also be a means for Sweden to contribute to international peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts. This can include providing military resources and personnel for peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, as well as participating in international sanctions and embargoes to deter and prevent aggression and human rights violations.

The absence of a national defense can have serious consequences for Sweden. Without a defense, the country would be vulnerable to external threats and unable to protect its citizens, borders, and interests. Additionally, without a defense, Sweden would be unable to fulfill its obligations to EU and NATO, and would be unable to contribute to international peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts. Furthermore, the absence of a national defense can also lead to a loss of confidence and respect from other countries, which can have negative effects on trade and diplomacy.

To conclude, the necessity of a national defense for Sweden is clear. A national defense can protect the country's citizens and borders from external threats, protect the country's interests and values, and contribute to international peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts. Without a national defense, Sweden would be vulnerable to external threats and unable to fulfill its obligations to EU and NATO, and unable to contribute to international peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts. It is important for Sweden to maintain a strong and capable national defense in order to protect its citizens and contribute to global security.",1
440,0231.a2.txt,Speciesism -The racism against animals,"Speciesism, like racism and sexism, is a form of discrimination that is based on the belief that certain beings are superior to others. In the case of speciesism, this belief is based on the idea that humans are superior to animals. This belief is reflected in the way animals are treated, with many being used for food, clothing, experimentation, and entertainment without any consideration for their well-being. In this essay, I will explore the concept of speciesism and the ways in which it is reflected in society.

One way in which speciesism is reflected in society is through the use of animals for food. Many animals are raised on factory farms, where they are subjected to inhumane conditions and are treated as nothing more than commodities. These animals are often kept in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions, and are subjected to practices such as debeaking, tail-docking, and castration without any pain relief. These practices are done to increase productivity and profits, and are considered acceptable because animals are viewed as inferior to humans.

Another way in which speciesism is reflected in society is through the use of animals for clothing. Many animals, such as cows, sheep, and rabbits, are raised for their fur and wool, which are used to make clothing. These animals are also subjected to inhumane conditions and are treated as nothing more than a resource to be exploited. They are often kept in small, cramped cages, and are subjected to practices such as mulesing and tail-docking without any pain relief.

Speciesism is also reflected in the use of animals for experimentation. Animals are often used in research and testing to develop new drugs and medical treatments. These animals are subjected to a wide range of procedures, including surgery, radiation, and chemical exposure. These procedures are often done without any regard for the animal's well-being, and are considered acceptable because animals are viewed as inferior to humans.

The use of animals for entertainment is also a form of speciesism. Animals are used in circuses, zoos, and marine parks for human entertainment. These animals are often kept in small, unnatural environments and are forced to perform tricks and stunts that are detrimental to their well-being. They are also subjected to transportation and confinement, which can lead to stress and health issues.

Speciesism is not only reflected in the way animals are treated but also in the way society views them. Many people view animals as nothing more than resources to be used and exploited for human benefit, without any consideration for their well-being. This view is reflected in laws and policies, which often prioritize human interests over animal welfare.

The consequences of speciesism are severe. It leads to the suffering and exploitation of animals, and it also undermines the values of empathy, justice, and compassion. Additionally, speciesism can also lead to the destruction of biodiversity and ecosystems, which can have negative effects on the planet",1
441,0232.a2.txt,To live in a student hostel,"Living in a student hostel can be a unique and enriching experience for many students. Hostels provide a sense of community and camaraderie, as well as a chance to learn from and interact with people from different backgrounds and cultures. However, there are also some potential downsides to living in a hostel, such as lack of privacy and potential conflicts with roommates. In this essay, I will explore the pros and cons of living in a student hostel.

One of the biggest advantages of living in a student hostel is the sense of community and camaraderie. Hostels typically have a diverse population of students from different backgrounds, cultures, and countries. This can provide a great opportunity to learn from and interact with people from different perspectives, which can be a valuable experience for personal growth and development. Additionally, hostels often have common areas such as lounges, kitchens, and study areas, where students can come together and socialize, which can foster a sense of community and belonging.

Another advantage of living in a student hostel is the cost-effectiveness. Hostels are often cheaper than other housing options, such as apartments or dormitories, which can be a great option for students on a tight budget. Hostels also typically provide basic amenities such as beds, desks, and shared bathrooms, which can save students money on furniture and household items.

Living in a hostel can also be a great way to meet new people and make friends. Hostels are often home to students from around the world, and many students find that the hostel community is a great way to meet and interact with people from different cultures. This can be a great opportunity to learn about different cultures and make connections that can last a lifetime.

However, there are also some potential downsides to living in a student hostel. One of the biggest downsides is the lack of privacy. Hostels typically have shared bedrooms and bathrooms, which can make it difficult to have any privacy. Additionally, hostels also often have strict rules and regulations that can be restrictive and difficult to navigate.

Another potential downside is the potential for conflicts with roommates. Hostels often have a diverse population of students, and it can be difficult to find compatible roommates. Conflicts can arise over things like noise levels, cleanliness, and personal habits, which can be difficult to resolve.

Lastly, living in a hostel can also be a bit of a challenge when it comes to studying and doing homework, as the environment can be noisy, and the common areas are often crowded, making it difficult to find a quiet space to",1
442,0234.a2.txt,A concert hall - a matter of course,"A concert hall is a vital part of any community, offering a space for musical performances and cultural events. A concert hall is not only a place for entertainment, but also a place for education, community building, and cultural exchange. From grand opera houses to intimate jazz clubs, concert halls serve a wide range of purposes and audiences. In this essay, I will explore the importance of concert halls and the role they play in a community.

One of the most significant benefits of concert halls is the role they play in providing access to the arts. Concert halls offer a wide range of musical performances, from classical to contemporary, and from local to international acts. They provide a platform for local and emerging artists to showcase their talents, and for audiences to discover new music and artists. Concert halls also offer educational opportunities, such as workshops, masterclasses, and lectures, which can help to foster a deeper understanding and appreciation of music and the arts.

Concert halls also play a vital role in community building. They bring people together, creating a sense of shared experience and common ground. Concert halls provide a space for people to come together and enjoy music, regardless of their background or social status. This can help to break down barriers and foster a sense of community and belonging.

Moreover, concert halls can also serve as a source of cultural exchange. They provide a platform for artists from different cultures to share their music and traditions, which can help to promote understanding and appreciation of different cultures. Concert halls also provide opportunities for audiences to experience different cultures and music, which can broaden their perspectives and understanding of the world.

Concert halls also provide significant economic benefits to a community. They can attract tourists and visitors, boosting the local economy. Concert halls also provide jobs for musicians, stagehands, and other staff, which can help to support the local economy. Additionally, concert halls can also help to revitalize a community by bringing new life to historic buildings and revitalizing downtown areas.

However, concert halls also come with some challenges. One of the biggest challenges is the cost of building and maintaining a concert hall. Building a concert hall is a significant investment, and it can be difficult to secure funding. Additionally, the cost of maintaining a concert hall can also be high, with ongoing expenses such as utilities, staffing, and programming.

Another challenge is the competition for audiences. With the proliferation of digital platforms and streaming services, concert halls face competition from other forms of entertainment",1
443,0235.a2.txt,Abolish day nursery for children under four.,"The topic of whether or not day nurseries for children under four should be abolished is a contentious one. Day nurseries, also known as preschools or daycares, provide care and education for young children while their parents are at work or otherwise occupied. However, some argue that these institutions are unnecessary and that children would be better off being cared for by their parents or other family members. In this essay, I will explore the arguments for and against abolishing day nurseries for children under four.

One of the main arguments for abolishing day nurseries for children under four is that young children are better off being cared for by their parents or other family members. Proponents of this view argue that young children need close, consistent relationships with the adults who care for them, and that day nurseries cannot provide the same level of care and attention as parents or other family members. They also argue that young children benefit from being in a home environment where they can develop a sense of belonging and attachment.

Another argument for abolishing day nurseries is that they can be detrimental to children's development. Some research suggests that young children who attend day nurseries may be at a higher risk of developing behavioral and emotional problems, and may have lower cognitive development than those who are cared for by family members. Additionally, young children may be at a higher risk of developing illnesses or infections when in day care centers due to the higher exposure to germs and other illnesses.

On the other hand, there are also arguments against abolishing day nurseries for children under four. One of the main arguments is that day nurseries provide an essential service for working parents who need childcare in order to go to work. Without day nurseries, many parents would be unable to work, which would have a negative impact on the economy and society. Furthermore, day nurseries can provide a safe and stimulating environment for young children, with trained professionals who can provide education and care that can aid in the child's development.

Additionally, day nurseries can also provide a sense of community and socialization for young children. They provide an opportunity for children to interact with other children and adults, which can be beneficial for their social and emotional development. Day nurseries also provide a structured environment, which can help children learn to follow rules and routines, which is important for their development.

Another argument against abolishing day nurseries is that it would be difficult to implement. Many families rely on day nurseries to provide childcare, and it would be difficult to find alternative solutions for",1
444,0236.a2.txt,"The family, not the state, should look after the elderly","The issue of elderly care is an important one, as the population ages and more individuals require assistance with daily living. The question of who should be responsible for caring for the elderly is a contentious one, with some arguing that the state should be responsible and others arguing that the family should be responsible. In this essay, I will explore the argument that the family, not the state, should be responsible for looking after the elderly.

One of the main arguments for the family being responsible for elderly care is that family members have a deeper understanding and connection to the elderly individual. Family members have a personal relationship with the elderly individual, and are often more aware of their needs, preferences, and medical history. They are also more likely to be able to provide the emotional support and companionship that the elderly individual needs.

Another argument for the family being responsible for elderly care is that it can be more cost-effective. Government-funded elderly care can be expensive and may not always provide the level of care that the elderly individual needs. Family members, on the other hand, may be able to provide care at a lower cost, as they are not subject to the same financial constraints as government-funded institutions. Additionally, family members may be able to provide care in the elderly individual's own home, which can be more comfortable and less disruptive than moving them to an institutional setting.

Furthermore, family members may be more willing and able to provide specialized care for elderly individuals with specific needs, such as those with dementia, Alzheimer's or other chronic illnesses. They may also be more equipped to provide emotional support, which is essential for the elderly in order to maintain their overall well-being.

However, there are also some arguments against the family being responsible for elderly care. One of the main arguments is that family members may not have the necessary skills, knowledge, or resources to provide the level of care that the elderly individual needs. Additionally, family members may not be able to provide care on a full-time basis, which can lead to gaps in care.

Another argument against the family being responsible for elderly care is that it can put a strain on the family's own resources and finances. Caring for an elderly family member can be time-consuming and costly, and it can be difficult for family members to balance their own responsibilities with caring for an elderly relative. Furthermore, it can put a strain on family members' relationships as they may not agree on how to provide care, or may feel resentful towards one another.

Lastly, in some cases, the elderly individual may not have any family members who are able or willing to provide care, in which case the state should provide care for them. The state should ensure",1
445,0237.a2.txt,"One could argue that the Monarch does not have any real political power and is therefore merely to be seen as an ambassador who travels round the world as a representative for his country. But there are many aspects of the monarchicalsystem and even though the Monarch's powers are very limited his or her position as the Head of State is of principal matter. Because the Monarch is given his title by heredity and is consequently not chosen by the people. This is the antithesis to the main thought of democracy, that the power emanates from the people. Another disturbing factor which interferes with the thought that all individuals are equal is that the Monarch historically has been looked upon as a divine ruler, that is a ruler chosen by God. And he does still today in our modern society stand above the grey mass of working- and middle class people. The Monarch is part of and in a way a symbol for the class society which is advancing rapidly. He does not have to prove that he has any kind of qualifications at all for his office. And it takes at least eight years and two votes in the Parliament if a monarch is to be removed from his office.","Sweden is a Scandinavian country located in Northern Europe. It is known for its natural beauty, including forests, lakes, and mountains, as well as its rich cultural heritage. The Swedish monarchy is one of the oldest in Europe, dating back to the 9th century. The current monarch is King Carl XVI Gustaf, who has been on the throne since 1973.

The Swedish monarchy is a constitutional monarchy, meaning that while the monarch holds ceremonial duties and represents the country in a symbolic sense, they do not hold any political power. The government is run by elected officials and the monarch's role is mostly limited to representing Sweden in official state matters and performing ceremonial duties.

One of the main roles of the Swedish monarch is to act as the head of state. This includes representing Sweden in official state visits, hosting foreign heads of state, and attending state ceremonies. The monarch also has the power to grant pardons and to appoint certain government officials, such as the Prime Minister.

Another important role of the Swedish monarchy is to act as a symbol of national unity and continuity. The monarchy has been a part of Swedish society for over a thousand years and serves as a link to the country's past. The monarch also serves as a symbol of continuity, representing the country through times of change and political turmoil.

The Swedish monarchy is also known for its commitment to social and environmental causes. The King and Queen are actively involved in charitable organizations and often use their platform to raise awareness about important issues such as poverty, climate change, and human rights. The royal family also actively promotes sustainable living and environmental conservation.

The Swedish monarchy is also known for its transparency and accessibility. The royal family is often seen in public and they are known for their close relationship with the Swedish people. The monarchy also releases a large amount of information about their activities, finances, and other matters to the public.

Despite the monarchy's ceremonial and symbolic role, there have been calls for the abolition of the monarchy in recent years. Some argue that the monarchy is an outdated institution that is no longer necessary in modern society. Others argue that the monarchy is a symbol of inequality and that the country would be better off without it.

However, polls have shown that the majority of Swedes support the monarchy and see it as an important part of the country's cultural heritage. The monarchy is also seen as a unifying force in a country that is increasingly diverse and multicultural.

In conclusion, the Swedish monarchy is a constitutional monarchy with a long history and deep roots in Swedish society. The monarch holds ceremonial duties and represents the country in official state matters, but does not hold any political power. The monarchy also acts as a symbol of national unity and continuity and is actively involved in social and environmental causes.

446,0238.a2.txt,Watching TV is bad for children,"Watching television has been a popular pastime for many people, including children, for decades. However, recent research has shown that excessive television viewing among children can have negative effects on their physical, emotional, and cognitive development. In this essay, we will examine the ways in which watching TV can be bad for children, and why it is important for parents to limit their child's screen time.

One of the main ways that watching TV can be bad for children is by impacting their physical health. Studies have shown that children who watch a lot of television tend to be more sedentary and are at a higher risk for obesity. Sitting in front of a screen for prolonged periods of time can also lead to poor posture, eye strain, and headaches. Furthermore, TV commercials often advertise unhealthy foods, which can contribute to poor dietary habits and weight gain.

Watching too much television can also have negative effects on children's emotional and cognitive development. Studies have shown that excessive television viewing can lead to increased aggression and decreased social skills among children. This is because children may learn aggressive behavior from the violence they see on TV, and may also have less interaction with their peers and parents when they are spending more time in front of the screen. Additionally, children who watch a lot of TV tend to have shorter attention spans and may have difficulty focusing on tasks or activities that require concentration.

Another way that watching TV can be bad for children is by exposing them to inappropriate or harmful content. Children's programming often contains violence, sexual content, and other mature themes that may not be appropriate for young viewers. Furthermore, children may be exposed to commercials that promote unhealthy or dangerous products or behaviors. Additionally, watching TV can also replace activities that are beneficial for children such as playing, reading, and spending time with family and friends, which can negatively impact their emotional, social and cognitive development.

Finally, it is important to note that excessive television viewing can also have a negative impact on family dynamics. When children spend a lot of time in front of the screen, they may have less time to spend with their parents and siblings, which can lead to a lack of communication and poor relationship. Furthermore, when parents rely on the TV as a form of babysitter, they may be less likely to actively engage with their children and be less aware of what they are watching.

In conclusion, watching television can be bad for children in multiple ways. It can have negative effects on their physical health, emotional and cognitive development, and expose them to inappropriate or harmful content. Furthermore, excessive television viewing can also have a negative impact on family dynamics and can replace activities that are beneficial for children. It is important for parents to limit their child's screen time and actively monitor the content they are watching. Encouraging children to engage in other activities such as reading, playing, and spending time with family and friends can help promote healthy development and positive family dynamics.",1
447,1002.a2.txt,Our right to live,"The right to live is one of the most fundamental and inalienable human rights. It is the foundation upon which all other rights and freedoms are built, and it is the basis for our ability to lead meaningful and fulfilling lives. This right is recognized and protected by international law, and is considered to be a universal principle that applies to all people, regardless of race, religion, gender, or any other characteristic.

The right to live is rooted in the principle of human dignity. Each person is considered to be a unique and valuable individual, with inherent worth and value. This right is not dependent on any external factors, such as wealth or social status, but is a fundamental aspect of our humanity. As such, it is considered to be an inalienable right, meaning that it cannot be taken away or denied to anyone.

The right to live is also closely linked to the right to physical security and bodily autonomy. Every person has the right to be free from violence, torture, and other forms of physical harm, and to make decisions about their own bodies and health. This includes the right to access medical care and to make informed choices about medical treatment, as well as the right to be free from discrimination and abuse.

The right to live is also closely linked to the right to freedom of expression, thought, and religion. Every person has the right to hold and express their own beliefs and opinions, and to seek and receive information without fear of censorship or punishment. This includes the right to access education and to participate in the political process, as well as the freedom to practice one's own religion or belief.

However, the right to live is not always respected and protected around the world. In many countries, people are denied this right due to discrimination, poverty, conflict, or other forms of oppression. For example, in war-torn areas, individuals are at a higher risk of violence, displacement, and death. In many countries, individuals are discriminated against because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, or other characteristics. Additionally, poverty and lack of access to basic necessities such as food, water, and healthcare can also threaten the right to live.

It is important to note that the right to live also includes the right to live in a healthy and sustainable environment. Climate change, pollution, and deforestation are all issues that threaten the right to live for many individuals around the world. These issues disproportionately affect marginalized communities and the individuals who are the least responsible for causing these problems.

The international community has a responsibility to protect and promote the right to live. This includes taking action to address the root causes of violence and discrimination, and providing humanitarian assistance to those in need. It also includes working to address issues such as poverty, climate change, and environmental degradation, which threaten the right to live for many individuals around the world.

In conclusion, the right to live is one of the most fundamental and inalienable human rights. It is the foundation upon which all other rights and freedoms are built, and it is the basis for our ability to lead meaningful and fulfilling lives. However, this right is not always respected and protected around the world, and it is the responsibility of the international community to take action to protect and promote it for all individuals. It is also important to remember that this right also includes the right to live in a healthy and sustainable environment. We must work together to address the root causes of violence and discrimination, and to provide humanitarian assistance to those in need, to ensure that every person can live a life with dignity and security.",1
448,1003.a2.txt,NA,"Divorce is a difficult process for all involved, but it can be especially challenging for children. The effects of divorce on kids can vary depending on their age, the specific circumstances of the divorce, and the level of support they receive during and after the process. In this essay, we will examine the ways in which divorce can affect children and the steps that parents and caregivers can take to mitigate these effects.

One of the main effects of divorce on kids is emotional distress. Children may experience a range of emotions including sadness, anger, guilt, and confusion. They may also feel a sense of loss and abandonment, particularly if they are close to one of the parents who is leaving the family home. This emotional distress can manifest in different ways, such as changes in behavior, mood, or academic performance.

Divorce can also affect children's mental health. Kids may experience symptoms of depression and anxiety, and may have difficulty sleeping or eating. They may also have difficulty trusting others or forming new relationships. These mental health issues can have long-term effects on children's well-being and may require professional help to address.

Divorce can also have a negative impact on children's academic performance. Children may have trouble focusing in school or may experience a decline in grades. They may also have difficulty forming friendships and participating in extracurricular activities. These effects can be particularly severe if the child is already struggling academically or socially.

Divorce can also have a negative impact on children's relationships with their parents. Children may have difficulty adjusting to living in two separate homes and may struggle to balance their loyalty to both parents. They may also have difficulty understanding why their parents are divorcing and may blame themselves for the breakup. This can lead to feelings of guilt and confusion, and may make it difficult for the child to form healthy relationships with either parent in the future.

Despite the negative effects of divorce on children, there are steps that parents and caregivers can take to mitigate these effects. One of the most important things that parents can do is to provide emotional support for their children during and after the divorce. This may include talking to them about their feelings, listening to them, and being there for them when they need it. Parents should also try to be sensitive to their children's needs and to avoid arguing or discussing negative aspects of the divorce in front of them.

Another important step that parents can take is to minimize the disruption to their children's lives as much as possible. This may include trying to maintain a consistent schedule, keeping their children's routine as similar as possible, and minimizing changes to their children's school and extracurricular activities.

Parents should also try to maintain a positive relationship with their children, despite the divorce. This may include making time for regular visits, phone calls, or other forms of communication. Parents should also try to avoid badmouthing the other parent and should instead encourage their children to maintain a positive relationship with both parents.

Finally, parents should also consider seeking professional help if their children are struggling with the effects of the divorce. This may include counseling, therapy, or other forms of support. These services can help children process their feelings and develop coping strategies, which can help them to better adjust to the changes in their lives.

In conclusion, divorce can have a significant impact on children's emotional, mental and academic well-being. It can cause a range of negative emotions, mental health issues, and academic difficulties. However, there are steps that parents and caregivers can take to mitigate these effects. Providing emotional support, minimizing disruption, maintaining positive relationships, and seeking professional help can help children to better cope with the changes in their lives. It's important for parents to remember that children are affected by the process",1
449,1005.a2.txt,Batman vs. Superman Why Batman is cooler the Superman,"Batman and Superman are two of the most iconic superheroes in comic book history. Both characters have been popular for decades and have been the subject of numerous films, TV shows, and other forms of media. While both characters have their own unique abilities and strengths, many people believe that Batman is cooler than Superman. In this essay, we will explore why Batman is considered to be cooler than Superman and why he continues to be a fan favorite.

One of the main reasons why Batman is considered to be cooler than Superman is his human nature. Unlike Superman, Batman is not an alien or a god-like being, but a human who uses his intelligence, resources and physical training to fight crime. This makes him relatable and more human, which allows audiences to connect with him on a deeper level. He doesn't have any extraordinary powers but still succeeds in fighting crime, which makes him more admirable.

Another reason why Batman is considered to be cooler than Superman is his use of technology and gadgets. Batman has an extensive array of gadgets and weapons at his disposal, including the Batmobile, the Batwing, and the Batarang. These gadgets give him an edge in combat and allow him to take on a wide variety of threats. Additionally, Batman's use of technology and gadgets also allows him to be more creative and strategic in his crime-fighting efforts, making him a more exciting and dynamic character.

The Dark Knight also has a more complex personality than Superman. Batman is a brooding and intense character who is driven by his own personal demons. He is haunted by the murder of his parents, which fuels his desire to fight crime and bring justice to Gotham. This complexity gives depth to the character and makes him more interesting to audiences. Superman, on the other hand, is often portrayed as a more straightforward, good-natured character, which can make him seem less interesting in comparison.

Another reason why Batman is considered to be cooler than Superman is his iconic costume and image. Batman's costume, which features a black cowl with pointy ears, a bat symbol on the chest, and a long flowing cape, is one of the most recognizable and iconic images in comic book history. The costume is also very functional, and it is designed to intimidate criminals, which is a key element of Batman's crime-fighting strategy. Superman's costume, on the other hand, while iconic in its own right, doesn't have the same level of intimidation factor.

Finally, Batman's rogue gallery of villains is considered to be one of the best in comic book history. Characters like The Joker, Catwoman, and The Riddler are some of the most iconic and recognizable villains in comics. They are complex, interesting, and often have a personal connection to Batman, which adds depth to their interactions with the Dark Knight. Superman's rogues gallery, while still impressive, doesn't have the same level of iconic status or complexity.

In conclusion, Batman is considered to be cooler than Superman for a variety of reasons. He is a human being who uses his intelligence, resources, and physical training to fight crime. He also has an extensive array of gadgets and weapons, which give him an edge in combat and make him more creative and strategic in his crime-fighting efforts. Additionally, Batman's personality is more complex and interesting than Superman, and his costume and image are iconic and recognizable. Finally, his rogue gallery of villains is considered to be one of the best in comic book history. These factors combined make Batman a fan favorite and a cooler character than Superman.",1
450,1006.a2.txt,"However, if someone brutally kills two people he never met before, is he still entitled to live? The bible says ""eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth"". If someone kills my friend, I am entitled to kill the killer. The victim's friends and relatives might find this justified; that the killer has wasted his rights to live and should die himself. The hate they feel towards the person who killed someone they loved must be tremendous. Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth- life for life, for life, for life... This could go on forever, in an endless, evil circle: the victim's friend kills the killer, the killer's friend kills the killer, and soon we would all end up as killers. Eye for an eye, tooth for tooth. The American judicial system thinks that killing should be resolved by killing, and that it is the most efficient way of preventing other people to do the same thing. The fact that there are now 3,000 death-row-convicts in the United States, and that the murders have not decreased, does not seem to effect their opinion.","The evolution of mankind is a fascinating and complex subject that has been studied and debated by scientists and scholars for centuries. The study of human evolution is an interdisciplinary field, drawing on the knowledge and expertise of anthropology, archaeology, biology, and other related fields. In this essay, we will explore the key milestones and events that have shaped the evolution of mankind, from our earliest human ancestors to the modern-day human.

The earliest known human ancestors appeared in Africa around 6 to 7 million years ago. These early hominids, such as Sahelanthropus, Orrorin, and Ardipithecus, were bipedal (able to walk on two legs) and had a number of human-like features such as a larger brain and smaller teeth than their ape ancestors. These early human ancestors were also believed to have been capable of basic tool use and had a more complex social structure than other primates.

Approximately 4 million years ago, the genus Australopithecus emerged in Africa. These hominids had a combination of ape-like and human-like characteristics, such as a small brain, long arms, and the ability to walk on two legs. The most famous member of this genus is Australopithecus afarensis, which is best known from the famous fossil Lucy.

Approximately 2.8 million years ago, the genus Homo appeared. This genus includes the first human species that is considered fully human: Homo habilis. This species had a larger brain than its predecessors, and was able to make and use complex stone tools. Homo habilis also had a more human-like body and jaw, which suggests that it was more efficient at eating and digesting food than earlier hominids.

Approximately 1.8 million years ago, Homo erectus appeared. This species had a larger brain than Homo habilis and was the first human species to migrate out of Africa. Homo erectus was also the first human species to control fire and make complex stone tools. Additionally, this species is believed to have had a complex social structure and may have had language abilities.

Approximately 200,000 years ago, the genus Homo sapiens appeared. Homo sapiens is the scientific name for modern humans. This species had a larger brain than Homo erectus and had the ability to create sophisticated tools and weapons. Homo sapiens also had the ability to create art and had a complex language and culture. Modern humans also developed the ability to adapt to different environments and migrate to different parts of the world",1
451,1007.a2.txt,Abolish the Monopoly,"A monopoly is a market structure where a single company or entity controls the entire market for a certain product or service. Monopolies are often seen as detrimental to the economy and society as a whole, as they can lead to higher prices, reduced innovation, and decreased competition. In this essay, we will explore the reasons why monopolies should be abolished, and the steps that can be taken to achieve this goal.

One of the main reasons why monopolies should be abolished is that they lead to higher prices for consumers. When a single company controls the entire market, it has the power to set prices at whatever level it wants, without fear of competition. This can lead to higher prices for consumers, as the company has no incentive to lower prices or offer discounts. Additionally, monopolies can also lead to reduced quality, as the company has no incentive to improve its products or services.

Monopolies also stifle innovation and competition. When a single company controls the entire market, there is no incentive for other companies to enter the market or to innovate new products or services. This can lead to a lack of new ideas and technologies, and can also slow economic growth. Furthermore, monopolies also discourage new companies from entering the market and competing, which can lead to a lack of choice for consumers and reduced competition.

Another issue with monopolies is that they can lead to market power abuse. Monopolies can use their market power to engage in anti-competitive practices, such as price fixing, exclusive dealing, and predatory pricing. This can lead to reduced competition and can also make it difficult for new companies to enter the market. Additionally, monopolies can also use their market power to influence government policies and regulations, which can further entrench their position and make it difficult to challenge them.

Finally, monopolies can also lead to economic inefficiencies. Monopolies often have little incentive to cut costs or improve productivity, as they can pass the costs onto consumers. This can lead to reduced economic growth and can also have a negative impact on the overall economy. Additionally, monopolies can also lead to reduced employment, as they often do not need to compete for workers and can afford to pay lower wages.

To abolish monopolies, several steps can be taken. One of the most effective ways to break up a monopoly is through anti-trust legislation. Anti-trust laws are designed to promote competition and prevent companies from engaging in anti-competitive practices. Additionally, governments can also regulate monopolies to ensure that they do not abuse their market power.

Another way to abolish monopolies is through deregulation. Deregulation is the process of removing or reducing government regulations on businesses, which can make it easier for new companies to enter the market and compete with existing monopolies. Additionally",1
452,1008.a2.txt,We have to preserve the right to free abortion,"The right to access safe and legal abortion is a fundamental human right that is essential for the health, well-being, and autonomy of women and individuals who can become pregnant. The ability to make informed decisions about one's own body and reproductive health is crucial for individuals to be able to fully participate in society and make decisions about their own lives. However, this right is often under threat, and it is crucial that we work to preserve and protect the right to free abortion.

One of the main reasons why we must preserve the right to free abortion is that it is essential for the health and well-being of women and individuals who can become pregnant. Restrictions on access to abortion can lead to unsafe and illegal procedures, which can have serious health consequences. Additionally, restrictions on abortion can also lead to delays in seeking care, which can also have negative health outcomes. Without access to safe and legal abortion, individuals may be forced to continue unwanted pregnancies, which can have a negative impact on their physical and mental health, as well as their ability to participate in society.

The right to access abortion is also crucial for individuals to have autonomy and control over their own bodies and lives. The ability to make informed decisions about one's own reproductive health is crucial for individuals to be able to fully participate in society and make decisions about their own lives. Without access to safe and legal abortion, individuals may be forced to continue unwanted pregnancies, which can have a negative impact on their ability to participate in society, including their ability to work, attend school, or care for their existing families.

Furthermore, restrictions on access to abortion can also have a disproportionate impact on marginalized communities. Low-income individuals, individuals of color, and those living in rural areas may have more difficulty accessing safe and legal abortion, and are more likely to be affected by restrictions on this right. Additionally, individuals who are already facing discrimination and barriers to accessing healthcare are more likely to be impacted by restrictions on abortion.

Another reason why we must preserve the right to free abortion is that it is a fundamental human right that is recognized by international law. The right to access safe and legal abortion is protected by a number of international human rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). These treaties establish that individuals have the right to make decisions about their own bodies and reproductive health and that states have an obligation to ensure that individuals have access to safe and legal abortion.

To preserve the right to free abortion, there are several steps that we can take. One of the most important steps is to work to ensure that individuals have access to accurate and comprehensive information about abortion and their reproductive health. This includes providing accurate information",1
453,1009.a2.txt,"Money, a symbol of happiness?","Money is often seen as a symbol of happiness and success, but is it truly the key to happiness? The relationship between money and happiness is complex and multifaceted, and while money can certainly bring certain benefits, it is not the only or even the most important factor in achieving happiness.

One of the main reasons why money is often seen as a symbol of happiness is that it can provide a sense of security and stability. Having enough money to meet our basic needs and have a comfortable standard of living can bring a sense of peace and well-being. Money can also provide access to material goods and experiences that can bring joy and pleasure. For example, having the means to travel, purchase a home, or buy a nice car can bring a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment.

However, it is important to note that the relationship between money and happiness is not a direct one. Studies have shown that once our basic needs are met, there is little correlation between increased wealth and increased happiness. Additionally, the pursuit of money can actually lead to negative consequences such as stress, anxiety, and even depression.

Another important factor to consider is that happiness is not solely dependent on material possessions or wealth. Research has shown that people who have strong relationships and a sense of purpose in their lives are generally happier than those who do not. Money can provide access to certain experiences and material goods, but it cannot replace the sense of connection and purpose that comes from social relationships and meaningful activities.

Additionally, there is a concept called the hedonic adaptation, which refers to the tendency for people to quickly adapt to new levels of wealth or material possessions. This means that even if money can bring temporary happiness, it is likely to be short-lived. People will quickly adapt to new levels of wealth and will find that the happiness that came with it is no longer there.

Moreover, it is crucial to recognize that the relationship between money and happiness is not the same for everyone. People have different values, priorities and aspirations. For some, money might be the main source of happiness, but for others, it might not be as important. Therefore, it is important to reflect on one's own values, priorities and aspirations and how they relate to money and happiness.

In conclusion, money can certainly bring certain benefits and can provide a sense of security and stability, but it is not the only or even the most important factor in achieving happiness. Happiness is a complex and multifaceted concept that is influenced by a variety of factors, including social relationships, meaningful activities, and a sense of purpose. Additionally, the relationship between money and happiness is not the same for everyone, and it is important to reflect on one's own values, priorities, and aspirations in relation to money and happiness.",1

However, being old does not necessarily mean being alone. While there are certainly challenges that come with aging, there are also many ways to maintain connections and find purpose and meaning in life as we get older.

One of the main reasons why aging can be associated with feelings of loneliness and isolation is that as we get older, we may lose loved ones or friends due to death or distance. Additionally, older adults may also experience physical limitations that make it more difficult to maintain social connections. However, this doesn't mean that older adults are doomed to be alone.

There are many ways to combat loneliness and isolation as we age. One important way is to maintain social connections. This can include joining clubs or organizations that align with our interests, volunteering in our community, or even using technology to stay connected with friends and family. Additionally, older adults can also seek out new connections by taking classes or workshops, or even by simply striking up a conversation with a neighbor or fellow church member.

Another important way to combat feelings of loneliness and isolation as we age is to find purpose and meaning in life. This can include engaging in activities that align with our interests, such as hobbies or volunteer work, or pursuing new interests and learning new skills. Additionally, older adults can also find purpose and meaning in life by caring for others, such as grandchildren or elderly relatives.

It's also important to note that there are various programs and services that are available to older adults to help them maintain connections and find purpose and meaning in life. For example, many communities offer programs such as Meals on Wheels, which delivers meals to older adults who are unable to leave their homes, or senior centers that provide a variety of activities and services to older adults. Additionally, many organizations also provide companionship services, such as friendly visiting programs, which pair older adults with volunteers who can provide companionship and support.

Furthermore, It's essential to understand that loneliness and isolation are not solely related to age, they can happen at any stage of life. A person can feel lonely and isolated even if they are surrounded by people. Loneliness and isolation can be caused by various factors such as a lack of social connections, a feeling of not belonging, or a lack of meaningful activities. Therefore, It's crucial to address these issues and take steps to prevent them from happening to anyone regardless of their age.

In conclusion, getting older does not necessarily mean being alone. While there are certainly challenges that come with aging, there are also many ways to maintain connections and find purpose and meaning in life as we get older. By maintaining social connections, finding purpose and meaning in life, and taking advantage of available programs and services, older adults can live fulfilling and meaningful lives, despite the challenges that come with aging.",1

456,1016.a2.txt,Test the mental health of the police force,"Mental health is a vital aspect of overall wellness and is critical to the well-being and effectiveness of law enforcement personnel. Police officers are often exposed to high levels of stress and trauma, which can lead to mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is important to test the mental health of the police force to identify and address any mental health concerns that may be present.

One way to test the mental health of the police force is through psychological evaluations. These evaluations can include standardized tests, interviews, and self-report measures to assess for symptoms of mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and PTSD. These evaluations can also provide insight into an individual's coping skills, resilience, and overall well-being.

Another way to test the mental health of the police force is through the use of surveys and questionnaires. Surveys and questionnaires can be used to gather information about an individual's mental health symptoms, stress levels, and overall well-being. They can also be used to gather information about the work environment and any potential sources of stress.

In addition to evaluations and surveys, regular mental health screenings can also be conducted. These screenings can be conducted by mental health professionals, such as psychologists or psychiatrists, and can help to identify any mental health concerns that may be present. These screenings can also be used to track an individual's mental health over time and to monitor any changes that may occur.

457,1017.a2.txt,No to separation for Basque Nationalists.,"Basque nationalism is a political movement that seeks self-determination and autonomy for the Basque people, who are an ethnic group with a distinct culture and language, living in the Basque Country, which is an autonomous community in northern Spain and southwestern France. The Basque nationalist movement has a long history and a complex relationship with the Spanish and French governments, and there are many different opinions and perspectives on the issue of separation.

One of the main arguments against separation for Basque nationalists is that it would lead to instability and conflict. The Basque Country is currently an autonomous community within Spain and France and has a high degree of self-government. Separating from Spain and France would likely lead to a protracted and potentially violent struggle for independence, which would harm not only the Basque people but also the rest of the population.

Another argument against separation for Basque nationalists is that it would have negative economic consequences. The Basque Country is an important industrial and economic region, and separation would likely lead to the disruption of trade and economic ties with the rest of Spain and France. It would also lead to the fragmentation of markets and the loss of economies of scale, which would harm the Basque economy in the long run.

Additionally, separation would also lead to the fragmentation of the European Union, which would harm the EU's unity and cohesiveness. The EU is based on the principle of shared sovereignty and the free movement of people, goods, and services. Separating from Spain and France would go against these principles and would harm the EU's stability and prosperity.

Furthermore, separation would also lead to the fragmentation of the Basque society itself. The Basque society is a diverse and multicultural society, and separation would likely lead to the formation of different states and the emergence of different national identities. This would harm the Basque society's unity and cohesiveness.

Another reason why separation is not the best option for Basque Nationalists is that the Basque community already enjoys a high degree of self-government and autonomy within Spain and France. The Basque Country is an autonomous community and has its own parliament, government, and police force. Additionally, the Basque language, culture, and heritage are protected and promoted by the Spanish and French governments.

In conclusion, the idea of separation for Basque nationalists is a complex and controversial issue with many different perspectives and opinions. While the",1

While it has been used throughout history as a form of punishment, it is now widely considered to be unacceptable in a modern democracy. There are a number of reasons why capital punishment is not compatible with the values and principles of a democratic society.

One of the main reasons why capital punishment is unacceptable in a modern democracy is that it is a violation of the right to life. All human beings have the right to life and this right should be protected and respected by the state. Capital punishment, however, involves taking the life of a person as a form of punishment, which is a violation of this fundamental right.

Another reason why capital punishment is unacceptable in a modern democracy is that it is a form of cruel and inhumane punishment. The death penalty is often carried out through methods such as lethal injection, electrocution, or hanging, which can cause immense suffering to the person being put to death. Additionally, the uncertainty and prolonged nature of the appeals process can also cause great stress and suffering to the condemned person as well as their families.

Capital punishment is also known to be racially and economically biased. Studies have shown that people of color and those from low-income backgrounds are disproportionately represented among those who are sentenced to death. This is unacceptable in a modern democracy, where all citizens should be treated fairly and equitably under the law, regardless of their race or economic status.

Furthermore, capital punishment is not an effective deterrent to crime. Studies have shown that states with the death penalty do not have lower crime rates than states without it. Additionally, the death penalty is also costly, and the money spent on appeals and legal proceedings could be directed towards more effective ways of reducing crime such as education, rehabilitation, and crime prevention programs.

Another important aspect to consider is the risk of executing an innocent person. The possibility of human error and misconduct in the criminal justice system means that there is always a risk of executing an innocent person. This is a grave injustice and it is unacceptable in a modern democracy that prides itself on protecting the rights and freedoms of its citizens.

In conclusion, capital punishment is incompatible with the values and principles of a modern democracy. It is a violation of the right to life, a form of cruel and inhumane punishment, racially and economically biased, not an effective deterrent to crime, costly and there is always a risk of executing an innocent person. A modern democracy should prioritize protecting the rights and freedoms of its citizens, and the death penalty is a violation of those fundamental principles. There are better and",1
459,1019.a2.txt,HIP-HOPPIN'TO THE BE-BOPPIN': DEFENDING THE HONOUR OF RAP MUSIC,"Rap music, also known as hip-hop, has long been a controversial and divisive genre. Many people view rap music as being vulgar, violent, and promoting negative stereotypes. However, these perceptions fail to recognize the complexity and diversity of rap music, as well as its cultural and historical significance. In this essay, we will defend the honor of rap music and argue why it is an important and valuable genre.

One of the key arguments in defense of rap music is that it is a powerful form of self-expression and storytelling. Rap music allows artists to share their personal experiences, struggles, and perspectives in a way that is raw and authentic. This can serve as a powerful tool for social and political commentary, as well as for creating a sense of community and connection among listeners. Additionally, rap music has been used as a form of resistance against oppression, racism, and poverty.

Rap music also plays a vital role in preserving and promoting the culture of the African American community. Rap music emerged from the Black community, particularly from the Bronx in New York City, in the 1970s, as a response to the social and economic struggles faced by the community. Rap music has served as a medium for Black artists to express their experiences and perspectives, and has helped to preserve and promote the culture and history of the Black community.

Moreover, many people view rap music as promoting negative stereotypes, but this is a narrow and stereotypical view that fails to take into account the diversity and complexity of the genre. Rap music is not a monolithic genre, and there are many different styles and themes represented within it. While some rap songs may contain lyrics that are controversial or offensive, it is important to remember that rap music is a reflection of society and the problems that exist within it, and it's not the only genre that has controversial lyrics.

Rap music also has a positive impact on the music industry, it has become a global phenomenon, and a multi-billion dollar industry. Rap music has been influential in the development of other genres of music such as R&B, Pop, and Electronic music. The rise of Rap music has also led to the creation of new jobs and businesses in the music industry. It has also led to the emergence of new artists and has helped to diversify the music industry.

In conclusion, rap music is an important and valuable genre that has been unjustly criticized and stigmatized. It is a powerful form of self-expression and storytelling that serves as a tool for social and political commentary. It plays a vital role in preserving and promoting the culture",1
460,1020.a2.txt,A teacher's status and salary: nothing to brag about,"Teaching is one of the most important and challenging professions in society. Teachers play a crucial role in shaping the minds and futures of our children, yet their status and salary often fall short of what they deserve. This is a concerning issue that needs to be addressed as it affects not only the teachers but also the education system and society as a whole.

One of the main reasons why a teacher's status is nothing to brag about is that they are not adequately compensated for their work. Despite the long hours, hard work, and dedication required to be a teacher, many are paid salaries that are below the average for other professions with similar levels of education and experience. This can make it difficult for teachers to make ends meet, and can also lead to high turnover rates and a shortage of qualified educators.

Another reason why a teacher's status is not up to par is that they are not adequately recognized for their contributions to society. Teachers are often viewed as being less important or less valuable than other professions, such as doctors or lawyers. This is not only unfair, but it also undermines the critical role that teachers play in shaping the future of our society. Teachers deserve to be respected and valued for the work they do, just as much as any other profession.

Furthermore, teachers are often not provided with the necessary resources and support to do their jobs effectively. This includes things like sufficient classroom materials, up-to-date technology, and professional development opportunities. This can make it difficult for teachers to provide the best education possible for their students, which in turn can lead to lower student achievement and a less effective education system.

Another issue is the lack of autonomy teachers have in their classrooms. Decisions regarding curriculum, assessment, and classroom management are often made by higher-ups, leaving teachers with little room for creativity and flexibility. This can make teaching a less fulfilling and less effective profession.

Lastly, the way teacher's performance is evaluated is not always fair and accurate. The way teachers are evaluated can be based on factors such as student test scores, which can be affected by factors beyond the control of the teacher, such as student background, poverty, and other socio-economic factors. This can lead to teachers being unfairly evaluated, which can lead to negative consequences for their career and reputation.

In conclusion, a teacher's status and salary are nothing to brag about. They are not adequately compensated for their work, not adequately recognized for their contributions to society, not provided with the necessary resources and support to do their jobs effectively, have limited autonomy in the classroom, and their performance is often evaluated unfairly.

462,1022.a2.txt,Swedens carnivores¬≠ a big threat!,"Sweden is known for its vast wilderness and diverse wildlife, which includes a variety of carnivorous animals such as bears, wolves, and lynx. However, in recent years, there has been growing concern about the impact that these carnivores are having on the country's environment and human populations. This essay will explore the issue of carnivores in Sweden and argue that they are not a significant threat.

One of the main arguments against carnivores in Sweden is that they are dangerous to human populations. Some people believe that these animals pose a threat to public safety and that they should be hunted or eliminated to protect human lives. However, studies have shown that the risk of human-carnivore conflicts is actually quite low. In fact, the risk of being attacked by a carnivore in Sweden is significantly lower than the risk of being injured or killed in a car accident.

Another argument against carnivores in Sweden is that they are harmful to the environment. Some people believe that these animals are responsible for declines in wildlife populations, such as deer and elk. However, studies have shown that the impact of carnivores on wildlife populations is actually quite small, and that other factors such as habitat loss and human hunting are likely to be the main drivers of population declines.

Additionally, carnivores play an important role in the ecosystem by helping to control populations of herbivores and maintaining biodiversity. They are also important for ecotourism, which can be a significant source of revenue for local communities.

Furthermore, many people in Sweden support the presence of carnivores in the country. They see them as an important part of Sweden's natural heritage and an important symbol of the country's wilderness. There are also many organizations and groups that work to promote the conservation of carnivores in Sweden and to educate the public about the importance of these animals.

In conclusion, carnivores in Sweden are not a significant threat. They pose a low risk to human populations, have a small impact on wildlife populations, play an important role in the ecosystem, and are supported by many people in the country. Instead of viewing carnivores as a problem, it's important to see them as an important part of Sweden's natural heritage and to take actions to protect and conserve them for future generations.",1
463,1023.a2.txt,"Save pop music - boycott ""carbon-paper"" artists!","Pop music is a genre of music that is enjoyed by millions of people around the world. It is characterized by its catchy melodies, upbeat rhythms, and relatable lyrics. However, in recent years, there has been a growing concern about the quality and originality of pop music. Many people believe that the industry is becoming increasingly dominated by ""carbon-paper"" artists, who are known for copying the styles and sounds of other successful artists. This essay will argue that it is crucial to save pop music by boycotting ""carbon-paper"" artists and supporting original and authentic musicians.

One of the main reasons why it is important to save pop music is that it is a powerful form of self-expression and storytelling. Pop music allows artists to share their personal experiences, struggles, and perspectives in a way that is raw and authentic. However, ""carbon-paper"" artists lack this authenticity, they copy the style and sound of other successful artists, which can lead to a lack of originality and creativity in the pop music industry.

Another reason why it is important to save pop music is that it plays a vital role in preserving and promoting the culture of the music industry. Pop music is a reflection of the culture and the society we live in, and it should reflect the diversity of human experience. However, ""carbon-paper"" artists can lead to a homogenization of the industry, where all music sounds the same, and it can limit the diversity of the culture.

Moreover, ""carbon-paper"" artists are bad for the industry's economy, they do not contribute to the creation of new jobs and businesses, and they do not provide the same level of revenue as original and authentic musicians. Supporting original and authentic musicians can help to create new opportunities for the industry and contribute to the local economy.

Furthermore, ""carbon-paper"" artists can be bad for the development of new artists. They set a bad example for aspiring musicians by copying the styles and sounds of other successful artists, instead of developing their own unique style. This can lead",1
464,1026.a2.txt,Who own the right to my death?,"The question of who has the right to make decisions about one's own death is a complex and controversial one. The right to die, also known as the right to end-of-life care, is a fundamental aspect of individual autonomy and self-determination. However, it is also a highly sensitive and emotional topic that raises many ethical and legal questions. This essay will explore the issue of who owns the right to one's death and argue that it ultimately belongs to the individual.

One of the main arguments for the individual owning the right to their death is that it is a fundamental aspect of personal autonomy and self-determination. Every person has the right to make decisions about their own life, and this includes the right to make decisions about the end of their life. This means that individuals should have the right to make decisions about when, where, and how they die, as well as the right to access end-of-life care that aligns with their values and beliefs.

Another argument for the individual owning the right to their death is that it respects the inherent value of human life. The right to die acknowledges that every person's life is unique and valuable, and that each individual has the right to make decisions about how they want to live and die. This means that individuals should have the right to make decisions about their own death, even if these decisions may be difficult or controversial.

Furthermore, the right to die is also an important aspect of human dignity and compassion. Allowing individuals to make decisions about their own death can help to alleviate suffering and ensure that they are able to die with dignity and respect. This includes providing access to end-of-life care that is tailored to their needs and preferences, as well as respecting their autonomy and self-determination.

On the other hand, some people may argue that the right to die should not be left entirely to the individual. They may argue that society has an obligation to protect vulnerable individuals from making decisions that may not be in their best interest. They also may argue that there should be limits to the right to die, to ensure that it does not lead to abuse or coercion.

However, it is important to note that there are already laws and regulations in place to protect vulnerable individuals and to ensure that the right to",1
465,1029.a2.txt,Systembolaget-should it remain or be closed down,"Systembolaget is the state-owned alcohol retail monopoly in Sweden. It is responsible for the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the country and has been in operation since 1955. The question of whether Systembolaget should remain or be closed down is a contentious one, with opinions varying widely on the matter. This essay will explore the arguments for and against the continuation of Systembolaget and argue that it should remain in operation.

One of the main arguments in favor of Systembolaget is that it helps to reduce alcohol-related harm. The monopoly has been credited with reducing alcohol consumption, particularly among young people, and helping to minimize the negative effects of alcohol on society. By controlling the sale and distribution of alcohol, Systembolaget is able to regulate the availability of alcohol and prevent excessive drinking. This can lead to a reduction in alcohol-related problems such as crime, accidents, and health issues.

Another argument in favor of Systembolaget is that it provides a significant source of revenue for the government. The monopoly generates a significant amount of money through taxes and profits, which can be used to fund public services and programs. Additionally, Systembolaget also employs a large number of people and contributes to the economy.

Furthermore, Systembolaget also provides a level of social control over the sale and distribution of alcohol. The monopoly ensures that alcohol is sold in a responsible and regulated manner, with strict rules in place to prevent under-age drinking, and to ensure that alcohol is not sold in a way that promotes excessive consumption. This helps to promote a culture of responsible drinking in the country.

On the other hand, some argue that Systembolaget should be closed down. They argue that it is an outdated and unnecessary system, and that it limits consumer choice and competition. They also argue that it is unfair to adults who should have the right to choose where and how to buy their alcohol. They argue that the state should not have a monopoly on alcohol sales and that it should be sold like any other commodity.

However, it is important to note that the Swedish government has decided to keep Systembolaget as a monopoly because it is seen as an effective tool in reducing alcohol-related harm and promoting a culture of responsible drinking. Additionally, a study conducted by the Swedish government in 2018 showed that the majority of the population support the monopoly.

In conclusion, Systembolaget should remain in operation. It helps to reduce alcohol-related harm, provides",1
466,1031.a2.txt,Capital Punishment-the Governments Mortal Sin,"Capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, is the legal process by which a person is put to death as a punishment for a crime. The death penalty has been used throughout history as a means of punishment for a variety of crimes, but it has become increasingly controversial in recent years. This essay will argue that capital punishment is a mortal sin committed by the government, as it violates the most basic human rights and is an ineffective deterrent to crime.

One of the main arguments against capital punishment is that it violates the right to life. The death penalty is the ultimate form of punishment, and it involves taking the life of a person who has been convicted of a crime. This is a fundamental violation of the most basic human right, the right to life, as it disregards the inherent value and dignity of human life.

Another argument against capital punishment is that it is an ineffective deterrent to crime. Studies have shown that the death penalty does not effectively reduce crime rates and that other forms of punishment, such as life imprisonment, are just as effective in deterring crime. Additionally, the death penalty often targets marginalized and disadvantaged communities, leading to a biased and unjust system.

Furthermore, capital punishment is also prone to error. The criminal justice system is fallible, and innocent people have been sentenced to death in the past. The risk of executing an innocent person is unacceptable and the possibility of such an occurrence is a grave injustice that cannot be undone.

Moreover, capital punishment is costly, both financially and morally. The cost of appeals and legal proceedings for death penalty cases is significantly higher than for non-death penalty cases. This is a waste of valuable resources that could be put to better use, such as funding education, healthcare, and social programs.

Lastly, capital punishment also goes against the values of many religions and moral codes, it violates the commandment ""thou shall not kill"" and it is considered as a mortal sin. Many religious and moral leaders believe that taking the life of another person is morally wrong, regardless of the circumstances.

In conclusion, Capital punishment is a mortal sin committed by the government. It violates the most basic human right, the right to life, it is an ineffective deterrent to crime, it is prone to error, it is costly, and it violates many religious and moral codes. As such, it should be abolished and replaced with more effective and humane forms of punishment that are in line with the",1
467,1032.a2.txt,Does killing ever do any good?,"Killing is the taking of a life, and it is an act that has been committed throughout history for various reasons. The question of whether killing ever does any good is a complex and controversial one, with opinions varying widely on the matter. This essay will explore the question of whether killing ever does any good and argue that in most cases, it does not.

One of the main arguments against killing is that it causes harm to individuals and society. Killing another person causes harm to the person who was killed, as well as to the family, friends, and community of the person who was killed. Additionally, killing can also cause harm to the person who did the killing, as it can lead to feelings of guilt, remorse, and trauma.

Another argument against killing is that it does not solve problems. Killing another person does not address the underlying issues that led to the conflict or crime. It is a short-term solution that does not address the root causes of the problem. Instead, it creates more problems and perpetuates cycles of violence.

Furthermore, killing violates the fundamental human right to life. Every person has the right to life, and taking away that right is a grave injustice. Killing is also a fundamental violation of human dignity and respect. It disregards the inherent value and worth of human life.

Moreover, killing is also morally wrong as it goes against the principles of many religions and moral codes. Many religious and moral leaders believe that taking the life of another person is morally wrong, regardless of the circumstances.

However, some people may argue that killing can be justifiable in certain circumstances, such as self-defense, or in the case of war. They may argue that killing can be necessary to protect innocent lives, or to defend oneself and one's country.

It is important to note that self-defense and war are two different subjects, in self-defense one is protecting oneself or another person from imminent harm, while in war the situation is different and it's a more complex issue. War is a decision made by the government and should be dealt with accordingly.

In conclusion, killing is an act that causes harm to individuals and society, and it does not solve problems. It violates the fundamental human right to life, it's morally wrong and it goes against many religious and moral codes. While it may be justifiable in certain circumstances such as self-defense, it should be avoided as much as possible and every effort should be made to find peaceful and non",1
468,1034.a2.txt,The usless art of debating,"Debating is the practice of discussing and presenting arguments for or against a particular topic or issue. It is often seen as a valuable tool for understanding different perspectives, fostering critical thinking, and improving communication skills. However, in recent years, there has been growing concern about the usefulness of debating. This essay will argue that debating is a largely useless art, as it often fails to lead to understanding or resolution, and can be detrimental to personal and social relationships.

One of the main arguments against debating is that it often fails to lead to understanding or resolution. Debating is often seen as a way to present one's own perspective and argue for it, but it often becomes a competition to win rather than a dialogue for understanding. Debating can lead to entrenchment of beliefs and positions, making it more difficult for people to see the other's perspective.

Another argument against debating is that it can be detrimental to personal and social relationships. Debating can be emotionally charged, and it can lead to personal attacks and hostility. It can also lead to alienation and division, causing damage to relationships, rather than fostering understanding and collaboration.

Furthermore, debating can also be harmful to mental health. It can lead to stress and anxiety, as well as feelings of frustration and helplessness. Debating can also perpetuate negative thought patterns and reinforce biases, leading to mental and emotional stagnation.

Moreover, debating can also perpetuate power imbalances. Often the people with more power and privilege in society are the ones who are able to control the conversation and dominate the debate, while the voices of marginalized groups are silenced or dismissed.

Lastly, debating can also be a waste of time and resources. It can be time-consuming and energy-intensive, and it often fails to lead to a resolution or understanding. It can divert resources away from more productive and effective ways of addressing issues and problems.

In conclusion, debating is a largely useless art. It often fails to lead to understanding or resolution, can be detrimental to personal and social relationships, harmful to mental health, perpetuate power imbalances, and can be a waste of time and resources. Rather than focusing on debating, it's important to focus on finding ways to foster understanding, empathy and collaboration, to come up with effective solutions to problems.",1
469,1036.a2.txt,Some Children have to Work,"Child labor is a serious issue that affects millions of children around the world. It is defined as any work that is dangerous, exploitative, or interferes with a child's education. Despite global efforts to eliminate child labor, it remains a persistent problem in many countries. This essay will argue that while child labor is a serious issue, some children have to work in order to survive and support their families.

One of the main arguments for children having to work is that it is often a necessity for survival. In many parts of the world, children are the primary breadwinners for their families and their labor is essential for their families to survive. Children often have to work to provide food, clothing, and shelter for themselves and their families. Without their contributions, their families would fall into poverty and suffer from a lack of basic necessities.

Another argument for children having to work is that it can provide them with valuable skills and experiences. Children who work learn valuable life skills such as responsibility, time management, and teamwork. Additionally, working can also provide children with a sense of purpose and self-worth. It can help them to feel like they are contributing to their families and communities, which can be very empowering.

Furthermore, child labor can also be seen as a form of education. Many children in developing countries do not have access to formal education and are unable to attend school. However, by working, they can learn valuable skills and trades that can help them to secure better jobs and opportunities in the future.

Moreover, child labor can also be seen as a necessary evil in some cases. In some cases, children are forced to work due to the lack of alternatives, such as poverty, war or displacement. In these cases, child labor may be the only option available to them to survive.

However, it's important to note that child labor is not always a necessity, it can also be the result of exploitation, and it's important to distinguish between the two. Children should not be forced to work under dangerous or exploitative conditions. The rights of children should be respected and protected, and child labor should be eliminated in situations that are detrimental to their physical and mental development.

In conclusion, child labor is a serious issue that affects millions of children around the world. However, some children have to work in order to survive and support their families. While child labor is a serious issue, it's important to understand the context and reasons behind it, and to distinguish between child labor that is a necessity and child labor that is",1
470,1039.a2.txt,POSTPONEMENT IS WRONG,"Postponing or procrastinating is the act of delaying or putting off tasks or responsibilities. While it may seem harmless at first, postponing can have negative consequences on one's personal and professional life. This essay will argue that postponing is wrong and should be avoided as much as possible.

One of the main arguments against postponing is that it can lead to decreased productivity and efficiency. When tasks are delayed, they often pile up and become overwhelming, making it more difficult to complete them. This can lead to a decrease in productivity and efficiency, as well as an increase in stress and anxiety. Furthermore, when a task is delayed, it can lose its relevance, making it hard to accomplish it, and can even lead to the task being abandoned.

Another argument against postponing is that it can negatively affect one's personal and professional reputation. When individuals habitually postpone tasks, they may be perceived as unreliable or untrustworthy by others. This can negatively affect relationships, both personally and professionally. Additionally, when tasks are delayed it can lead to missed deadlines and unfulfilled commitments, which can harm a person's reputation.

Furthermore, postponing can also lead to a lack of motivation and self-discipline. When individuals delay tasks, they often struggle to find the motivation and willpower to complete them. This can lead to a lack of self-discipline, as well as a lack of progress and achievement.

Moreover, postponing can also lead to a lack of personal growth and development. When individuals delay tasks, they may miss out on opportunities to learn new skills, develop their talents, and achieve their goals. This can lead to a lack of personal growth and development, as well as a lack of satisfaction and fulfillment in life.

471,1041.a2.txt,Silence,"Silence is the absence of sound or noise. It is often seen as something peaceful and calming, but it can also be uncomfortable or oppressive. The meaning and effects of silence can vary greatly depending on the context and individual experiences. This essay will explore the different meanings and effects of silence, and argue that while silence can have positive effects, it can also be harmful if imposed or used as a means of control.

One of the main positive effects of silence is that it can be calming and restorative. In a world where there is constant noise and stimulation, silence can provide a much-needed break and a chance to recharge. It can also be used as a tool for mindfulness and meditation, allowing individuals to focus on their thoughts and feelings, and to gain a sense of inner peace.

Another positive effect of silence is that it can be used to communicate. Silence can be used to convey a variety of emotions, such as sadness, anger, or contemplation. It can also be used to show respect and empathy, such as in a moment of mourning or in a situation where words are not necessary.

Furthermore, silence can also be used as a means of protest or resistance. When individuals or groups are not given a platform to speak, silence can be used to make a powerful statement. It can be used to draw attention to an issue and to highlight the lack of representation and power.

However, silence can also be used as a means of control and oppression. When imposed by authority figures or used to silence marginalized groups, silence can be used to maintain power and to prevent individuals from speaking out against injustice. It can be used to silence dissenting voices and to prevent individuals from asserting their rights and autonomy.

Moreover, silence can also be harmful to individuals. When imposed or used as a means of control, silence can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection. It can also lead to a lack of communication and understanding, and can perpetuate harmful patterns of behavior and power imbalances.

In conclusion, silence can have both positive and negative effects. It can be calming and restorative, and it can be used to communicate and to protest. However, when imposed or used as",1

Hamas is best known for its military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, which has been responsible for numerous acts of violence and terrorism against Israel. The organization's stated goal is the establishment of an independent Palestinian state and the liberation of Palestine from Israeli control. However, many have questioned the true motives and religious beliefs of Hamas, with some arguing that they are on a mission from God. This essay will examine the religious ideologies of Hamas and argue that while they may claim to be on a mission from God, their actions and tactics are not in line with traditional religious principles.

One of the main arguments against Hamas being on a mission from God is that their actions and tactics are not in line with traditional religious principles. Many religious scholars argue that Hamas's use of violence and terrorism is not in accordance with the principles of Islam. The religion promotes peace, and prohibits the killing of innocent people and children, the use of violence and terrorism is not in line with these principles.

Another argument against Hamas being on a mission from God is that they prioritize politics over religion. Hamas's actions and decisions are often driven by political motivations rather than religious ones. The organization has been known to use religion as a tool to gain power and support, rather than as a guiding principle for their actions.

Furthermore, Hamas's actions and statements often incite violence and hatred towards Israel and Jewish people. This goes against the principles of religious tolerance and respect for others, and it promotes a culture of violence and discrimination.

Moreover, Hamas's actions have resulted in the suffering and displacement of many innocent Palestinians. Their actions have led to the destruction of homes, businesses and infrastructure, and the displacement of thousands of Palestinians. This is not in line with the principles of compassion and care for one's fellow human beings, which is an important aspect of many religious beliefs.

Lastly, Hamas's actions have also led to the suffering and loss of life on the Israeli side. Their actions have led to the death and injury of many innocent Israelis, and it has caused fear and insecurity in the population.

The Bell Tolls for the Eurosong.,"The Eurovision Song Contest, also known as Eurosong, is an annual international song competition organized by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) since 1956. It is one of the longest-running television programs in the world, and it has become a beloved institution in many European countries. However, in recent years, there has been growing concern about the relevance and the quality of the songs in the contest. This essay will argue that the bell tolls for the Eurosong, as the contest has lost its appeal and original purpose.

One of the main reasons for the decline of the Eurosong is that the contest has lost its original purpose of showcasing the best and most diverse musical talent in Europe. In recent years, the contest has become more about commercial success and political voting, rather than about the quality of the songs. This has led to a homogenization of the songs, with many of them sounding similar and lacking originality.

Another reason for the decline of the Eurosong is that the contest has lost its appeal to a wider audience. The contest has become more niche, with a decreasing viewership and interest among the general public. This has led to a lack of engagement and excitement among viewers, and a lack of interest in the contest.

Furthermore, the contest has also become more politicized, with countries often voting along political lines rather than based on the quality of the songs. This has led to accusations of bias and unfairness, and has further damaged the reputation and credibility of the contest.

Moreover, the contest has also become more expensive to participate in, with countries having to bear the costs of staging elaborate performances and sending delegations. This has led to a decrease in the number of participating countries, and has further reduced the diversity and representation of the contest.

Lastly, the Eurosong has also faced criticism for its lack of inclusivity and representation. The contest has been criticized for its lack of diversity in terms of gender, race, and sexual orientation among participants and for not representing the true cultural diversity of Europe.

In conclusion, the bell tolls for the Eurosong, as the contest has lost its appeal and original purpose. The contest has become more about commercial success and political voting, rather than about the quality of the songs",1
474,1048.a2.txt,Capital Punishment,"Capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, is the legal process of putting a person to death as a punishment for a crime they have committed. The death penalty is a highly controversial and divisive issue, with strong arguments both for and against its use. This essay will examine the arguments for and against capital punishment and argue that while it may serve as a deterrent, the inherent flaws and biases in the system make it an unacceptable form of punishment in a modern democracy.

One of the main arguments in favor of capital punishment is that it serves as a deterrent. Supporters argue that the threat of the death penalty serves as a deterrent to would-be criminals and can reduce the number of violent crimes committed. However, research has shown that the deterrent effect of the death penalty is questionable, and that other forms of punishment such as life imprisonment without the possibility of parole can be just as effective in deterring crime.

Another argument against capital punishment is that it is inherently flawed and biased. The criminal justice system is not perfect, and it is prone to errors and wrongful convictions. In the United States, for example, over 150 people have been exonerated and released from death row since 1973, after evidence of their innocence came to light. The risk of executing an innocent person is a serious concern, and one that cannot be tolerated in a just and fair society.

Furthermore, capital punishment is also racially and economically biased. Studies have shown that people of color and those from low-income backgrounds are more likely to be sentenced to death and executed than white individuals and those from more affluent backgrounds. This is a serious violation of the principle of equal justice under the law and it undermines the legitimacy of the criminal justice system.

Moreover, the cost of imposing death penalty is also very high. The legal process for death penalty cases is much more expensive than non-capital cases, and it is an enormous financial burden on the state. This money could be used for other important issues such as education and healthcare.

Lastly, capital punishment is also in violation of human rights. The United Nations General Assembly has passed several resolutions calling for the worldwide abolition of the death penalty, and many countries have abolished the death penalty or placed moratoriums on its use. The use of death penalty is considered to be a violation of the right to life and the prohibition of cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment.

In conclusion, capital",1
475,1049.a2.txt,Increased Quality of Life-Something for You?,"Quality of life refers to the overall well-being and satisfaction of an individual in relation to various aspects of life such as health, happiness, and standard of living. The concept of an increased quality of life can mean different things to different people, but it generally refers to improvements or enhancements in one or more of these areas. This essay will explore the concept of increased quality of life, and argue that while it is a desirable goal, it is ultimately a personal and subjective concept that may not be attainable for everyone.

One of the main arguments for an increased quality of life is that it can lead to greater happiness and satisfaction. When people have access to better health care, education, and job opportunities, they are more likely to be satisfied with their lives and to feel a sense of purpose and fulfillment. Additionally, when people feel safe and secure in their communities, they are more likely to be happy and content with their lives.

Another argument for an increased quality of life is that it can lead to greater productivity and economic prosperity. When people have access to better education and job opportunities, they are more likely to be productive members of society and to contribute to the overall economic growth of a community. Additionally, when people have access to better healthcare, they are more likely to be able to work and contribute to society for longer periods of time.

However, it's important to note that the concept of increased quality of life is not always attainable for everyone. Factors such as poverty, discrimination, and lack of access to resources can make it difficult for some individuals to improve their quality of life. Additionally, an increased quality of life may not necessarily lead to greater happiness, as happiness is a complex and subjective concept that is influenced by many factors.

Moreover, the idea of an increased quality of life can also be misleading, as it may suggest that there is a universal standard of what a good life should look like. This can lead to pressure on individuals to conform to certain societal norms and expectations, rather than allowing them to define what a good life looks like for themselves.

Lastly, the pursuit of an increased quality of life may also lead to neglecting",1

Boy bands are known for their catchy pop songs, synchronized dance routines, and attractive members. However, boy bands have also been the subject of much criticism and debate, with some arguing that they are a negative influence on music and culture. This essay will explore the impact of boy bands on the music industry and argue that while they have their drawbacks, they have also had a positive influence on music and culture.

One of the main arguments against boy bands is that they are a negative influence on music and culture. Critics argue that boy bands are manufactured and lack originality, and that their music is shallow and lacking in substance. Additionally, boy bands are often seen as promoting a negative image of masculinity, with members often being objectified and sexualized.

Another argument against boy bands is that they are a product of record label manipulation and corporate interests. Boy bands are often created and groomed by record labels, who carefully curate their image and musical style to appeal to a specific audience. This has led to accusations that boy bands lack authenticity and are more concerned with commercial success than with artistic expression.

However, boy bands have also had a positive impact on the music industry and culture. Boy bands have helped to popularize pop music, and have brought it to a wider audience. They have also provided a platform for young men to express themselves and showcase their talents. Boy bands have also been a source of inspiration and empowerment for many young fans, particularly young women, who have seen them as role models and have been able to relate to their music and message.

Moreover, boy bands have also helped to break down barriers and promote diversity in the music industry. Boy bands have often been composed of members from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, and have helped to promote a sense of inclusivity and acceptance.

Lastly, boy bands have also helped to create a sense of community and belonging among fans. Boy bands have often had a dedicated fanbase, who have formed a sense of community and belonging through shared experiences and the music. This has helped to foster a sense of connection and support among fans, who have been able to relate to one another through the music.

In conclusion, boy bands have had a mixed impact on the music industry",1
477,1055.a2.txt,Let The Elderly Stay At Home,"The aging population is a growing concern in many developed countries, with an increasing number of elderly individuals requiring care and support. One of the options for elderly care is institutionalization, where elderly individuals are placed in long-term care facilities such as nursing homes. However, an alternative option is to allow the elderly to stay in their own homes and receive support and care there. This essay will argue that allowing the elderly to stay at home is a preferable option as it preserves their autonomy, promotes well-being and can be more cost-effective.

One of the main arguments for allowing the elderly to stay at home is that it preserves their autonomy. As individuals age, they may become increasingly dependent on others for care and support. However, by allowing them to stay in their own homes, they can maintain their independence and continue to make decisions about their own lives. This can promote a sense of self-worth and dignity, and can help to preserve their mental and emotional well-being.

Another argument for allowing the elderly to stay at home is that it promotes their well-being. Research has shown that older adults who receive care in their own homes are generally happier and more satisfied with their lives than those who are institutionalized. They have a sense of control over their surroundings and are able to continue with familiar daily routines, which can help to reduce feelings of isolation and loneliness.

Furthermore, allowing the elderly to stay at home can also be more cost-effective than institutionalization. Long-term care facilities can be very expensive, and many older adults may not have the financial resources to afford them. By allowing them to stay in their own homes, they can continue to receive care and support at a lower cost.

Moreover, allowing the elderly to stay at home also allows them to be closer to their families and loved ones. This can be beneficial for both the elderly individual and their family members, as it can help to maintain family connections and provide a sense of support and security.

Lastly, allowing the elderly to stay at home also helps to avoid the negative effects that come with institutionalization such as loss of autonomy, depression, and lack of privacy.

In conclusion, allowing the elderly to stay at home is a preferable option as it preserves their autonomy, promotes well-being and can be more cost-effective. It's important for society to provide the necessary support and resources for older adults to age in place, such as home care services, assistive technology, and community support programs. It's also important for families and loved ones to be involved in the care process and to provide emotional and practical support.",1

479,1057.a2.txt,Do you believe it's true?,"The question ""Do you believe it's true?"" is a broad and open-ended one, and can apply to a wide range of subjects. The question implies that there is a statement or idea in question, and asks the reader to evaluate whether they believe it to be true or not. The answer to this question is subjective and can vary depending on the individual and their perspective.

One of the main factors that determine whether someone believes something to be true is the evidence that supports it. When presented with a statement or idea, people will often look for evidence that supports or disproves it. For example, if presented with the statement ""The earth is flat,"" an individual may look for evidence such as satellite imagery and scientific research to determine whether or not they believe it to be true.

Another factor that can influence whether someone believes something to be true is their personal experiences and beliefs. Personal experiences can shape an individual's perspective and influence their beliefs. For example, if an individual has had a negative experience with a particular group of people, they may be more likely to believe negative stereotypes about that group.

Moreover, the media and social media plays a big role in shaping our beliefs, The information provided by the media is not always accurate and can be manipulated to fit a particular agenda, leading to the spread of false information. It's important to be critical of the information we consume and to fact-check before accepting something as true.

Additionally, cognitive biases can also play a role in shaping our beliefs. Confirmation bias, for example, is the tendency to search for and interpret information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs. This can lead to a lack of critical thinking and the acceptance of false information.

In conclusion, the question ""Do you believe it's true?"" is a complex and open-ended one, and the answer can vary depending on the individual and their perspective. Factors such as evidence, personal experiences, and cognitive biases can all influence whether someone believes something to be true. It's important to approach information with a critical mindset, fact-check and be open to changing our beliefs as new information becomes available.",1
480,1058.a2.txt,Slavery is not dead!,"Slavery is a system of forced labor in which one person is owned and controlled by another. Historically, slavery has been used for a variety of purposes, including economic gain and the maintenance of power and control. The abolition of slavery is often thought to be a thing of the past, but unfortunately, slavery still exists in various forms today. This essay will argue that slavery is not dead, and that it continues to exist in various forms around the world, including human trafficking, forced labor, and debt bondage.

One form of modern slavery is human trafficking, which is the illegal trade of people for the purpose of exploitation. This can include forced labor, sexual exploitation, and forced marriage. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), an estimated 21 million people are victims of forced labor worldwide. This includes individuals who have been trafficked across borders, as well as those who have been forced into labor within their own country.

Another form of modern slavery is forced labor, which is defined by the ILO as ""work or service that is extracted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily."" This can include individuals who have been forced to work in factories, on farms, or in other forms of labor. Forced labor is often found in industries such as agriculture, construction, and domestic work.

Debt bondage is another form of slavery. It's a situation where a person is forced to work to pay off a debt, and they are not able to leave the work until the debt is paid off. This often happens to people who are living in poverty, and can be used to exploit them.

Lastly, there is also the issue of child labor. Children are vulnerable and are often forced to work in dangerous conditions, and are paid very little or nothing at all. They are often forced to work in agriculture, mining and other hazardous jobs.

In conclusion, slavery is not dead, it still exists in various forms around the world. Human trafficking, forced labor, debt bondage and child labor are all forms of modern slavery that continue to affect millions of people globally. It's important for society to take action and to address these issues, through laws and regulations, education and awareness raising, and by supporting organizations that work towards ending slavery. It's also important for each of us to be aware of the products we buy, and not to support companies that use slave labor. Together we can work towards a world where slavery is truly dead.",1

However, in recent years, the franchise has faced criticism from fans and critics alike, with many arguing that the franchise has lost its way under Lucas' direction. This essay will argue that the Star Wars franchise needs to be saved from George Lucas, and that new leadership and creative direction are needed to restore the franchise to its former glory.

One of the main criticisms of George Lucas and his leadership of the Star Wars franchise is that he has lost touch with the fans and their expectations. Lucas has been criticized for making decisions that prioritize his own artistic vision over the desires of the fans. This has led to storylines, characters, and plot twists that have not been well-received by fans and have resulted in a loss of interest in the franchise.

Another criticism of Lucas is that he has lost sight of the original story and characters that made Star Wars so beloved. Lucas has been criticized for making changes to the original trilogy, such as adding CGI characters and changing the ending, which have been seen as unnecessary and detracting from the original story. Additionally, Lucas has also been criticized for creating new characters and storylines that have been seen as uninteresting and unnecessary.

Furthermore, Lucas has been criticized for his handling of the prequel trilogy and the subsequent sequels, which have been seen as poorly executed and lacking in the depth and complexity of the original trilogy. This has led to a loss of interest in the franchise and a decline in its popularity.

Moreover, Lucas's reluctance to give the franchise to new leadership and fresh perspectives has been detrimental to the franchise. A fresh perspective and new leadership could bring new ideas, characters, and storylines that will re-engage fans and breathe new life into the franchise.

482,1061.a2.txt,"To haze or not to haze, that is a question.","Hazing is a controversial practice that is commonly associated with fraternities, sororities, and other student organizations. It is defined as any activity that is required of a student to become a member of a group or organization, that is likely to cause physical, emotional or psychological harm. The practice of hazing is a complex issue, and there are valid arguments both for and against it. This essay will examine the arguments for and against hazing and argue that it is an unacceptable practice that should be banned.

One of the main arguments against hazing is that it is a form of abuse. Hazing activities can include physical abuse, such as being beaten or forced to consume excessive amounts of alcohol, and emotional abuse, such as being subjected to humiliation or ridicule. These activities can cause physical and emotional harm and can have long-lasting effects on the mental and emotional well-being of the individuals involved.

Another argument against hazing is that it is a violation of an individual's rights. Hazing activities are often mandatory and are not consensual, and individuals are often pressured or coerced into participating. This is a violation of an individual's right to make their own choices and to be treated with dignity and respect.

Furthermore, hazing is also illegal in many states, yet it still happens in many colleges and Universities. Many universities have implemented strict policies against hazing, but it still occurs due to a lack of enforcement. This indicates that hazing is a systemic problem that requires more than just a policy change to solve.

Moreover, hazing can also create a toxic culture within the group or organization. It can foster a culture of fear, secrecy, and abuse, which can lead to a lack of trust and respect among members. This can negatively impact the group's dynamics and can lead to a decline in its effectiveness.

Lastly, hazing can also lead to fatal consequences, several incidents have been reported where students lost their lives due to hazing. These tragic events show that hazing is not only harmful but also deadly.

483,1062.a2.txt,Is the individual freedom in danger?,"Individual freedom is a fundamental aspect of democracy and human rights. It refers to the ability of individuals to make choices and act on their own without interference from government or other external forces. In recent years, there have been concerns that individual freedom is in danger, with some arguing that government surveillance, censorship, and other forms of control are eroding personal liberties. This essay will examine the arguments for and against the notion that individual freedom is in danger and argue that while there are certainly challenges to individual freedom, it is still protected by laws and institutions.

One of the main arguments that individual freedom is in danger is the increasing use of government surveillance. In the name of national security, governments around the world have implemented surveillance programs that monitor the activities of citizens. This has raised concerns about privacy and the potential for abuse of power by government officials. However, it's important to note that these surveillance programs are subject to oversight by independent bodies and courts, and their use is often limited by laws and regulations that protect the rights of citizens.

Another argument that individual freedom is in danger is the rise of censorship, particularly on the internet. Governments and other organizations have implemented measures to control the flow of information and restrict access to certain websites and platforms. This has raised concerns about the potential for abuse of power and the erosion of free speech. However, it's important to note that censorship is often done to protect the rights of others, such as to prevent the spread of hate speech or incitement to violence.

Furthermore, some argue that individual freedom is in danger due to the increasing power of corporations and the wealthy. They argue that these entities have disproportionate influence over government policies and regulations, leading to policies that benefit their interests rather than those of the general population. However, it's important to note that laws and regulations exist to prevent the abuse of corporate power and ensure that the rights and interests of all citizens are protected.

Moreover, individual freedom is also threatened by rising authoritarian regimes around the world, which restrict civil liberties and human rights. These regimes often use tactics such as propaganda, censorship, and repression to maintain control, which can lead to a lack of freedom of speech, press, and peaceful assembly.

In conclusion, individual freedom is a fundamental aspect of democracy and human rights, and it's important to protect it. While there are certainly challenges to individual freedom, such as government surveillance, censorship, and the rise of authoritarian regimes, it's important to note that these challenges are often subject to oversight and",1

It is the study of human behavior, thought, and experience, and it is an essential part of many different industries and professions. One of the most important areas of psychology is the field of psychology, which focuses on the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of mental health disorders. The role of a psychologist is crucial in helping individuals to manage and overcome mental health problems, and it is therefore of the utmost importance that suitable individuals are selected for admission to psychologist programs.

One of the key factors that determine whether an individual is suitable for admission to a psychologist program is their academic background.

485,1065.a2.txt,Who Should Look After Grandma?,"As the population ages and life expectancy increases, more and more families are facing the question of who should look after their elderly relatives. In many cases, the responsibility falls on the shoulders of adult children, but there are also other options available. In this essay, I will explore the different options for caring for an aging grandparent, and the pros and cons of each.

One option for caring for an aging grandparent is for the adult children to take on the responsibility. This can include providing financial support, helping with household tasks, and providing in-home care. One of the main advantages of this option is that it allows the grandparent to remain in their own home and maintain a sense of independence. Additionally, adult children may feel a strong sense of responsibility and love for their grandparent, and may take great satisfaction in being able to care for them. However, this option can also be stressful and demanding for adult children, who may already have their own families and responsibilities to take care of. They may also feel overwhelmed by the emotional and financial burden of caring for an elderly relative.

Another option for caring for an aging grandparent is for them to move into a nursing home or assisted living facility. This can provide them with a higher level of care and support, including access to medical professionals, recreational activities, and socialization opportunities. This option may also provide peace of mind for adult children, who may not have the time or resources to provide the level of care their grandparent needs. However, this option can be expensive, and may also result in a loss of independence for the grandparent, who may feel lonely and isolated in a new and unfamiliar environment.

A third option is for the grandparent to move in with one of their adult children. This can provide them with a high level of care and support, while also allowing them to maintain their independence and live close to their family. This option can also be less expensive than a nursing home or assisted living facility. However, it can also be demanding for the adult child, who may have to make significant changes to their own home and lifestyle to accommodate their grandparent.

A fourth option is to hire a professional caregiver. This can provide a high level of care and support, while also allowing the grandparent to remain in their own home. This option can also provide peace of mind for adult children, who may not have the time or resources to provide the level of care their grandparent needs. However, this option can be expensive and may also result in a loss of independence for the grandparent, who may feel lonely and isolated with a stranger providing care.

Ultimately, the decision of who should look after grandma will depend on a number of factors, including the grandparent's health, the availability and resources of the adult children, and the grandparent's own preferences and needs. It is important for families to have open and honest conversations about these issues, and to work together to find the best solution for everyone involved.

In conclusion, caring for an aging grandparent is a complex and challenging task that requires careful consideration of many different factors. Adult children may take on the responsibility, but there are also other options available, such as nursing homes, assisted living facilities, moving in with one of the adult children, or hiring a professional caregiver. Ultimately, the most important thing is to make sure that the grandparent is receiving the care and support they need, while also allowing them to maintain as much independence and dignity as possible. This decision must be made with the best interest of the grandparent and the family as a whole in mind.",1
486,1067.a2.txt,GENETICALLY ENGINEERED FOODS: RISK TO HUMANITY,"Genetically engineered foods, also known as genetically modified organisms (GMOs), have become a contentious issue in recent years. These foods are created by introducing genetic material from one organism into another, in order to give the resulting organism new or improved characteristics. While many argue that GMOs have the potential to solve some of the world's food problems, others warn that they pose a serious risk to humanity. In this essay, I will examine the potential risks associated with genetically engineered foods and why they are a cause for concern.

One of the main concerns about GMOs is that they may have negative impacts on human health. There is evidence to suggest that consuming GMOs may lead to an increased risk of allergies, cancer, and other health problems. For example, a study published in the International Journal of Biological Sciences found that rats fed with a diet containing genetically modified corn developed significant organ damage, including damage to their liver and kidneys. Another study published in the Journal of Applied Toxicology found that rats fed with genetically modified soybeans had changes in their blood cells, including a reduction in the number of red blood cells. While these studies were done on animals, it raises concern about the potential effects on human health.

Another concern is that GMOs may lead to the creation of ""superweeds"" and ""superpests"". When crops are genetically engineered to be resistant to certain herbicides or pests, it creates a selective pressure on those weeds or pests to evolve resistance to the herbicide or pest. As a result, these ""superweeds"" or ""superpests"" can become resistant to the products designed to kill them, making it difficult or impossible to control them. This can lead to an increase in the use of more toxic chemicals and the potential loss of biodiversity.

GMOs may also have negative impacts on the environment. For example, the use of GMOs can lead to the loss of biodiversity, as non-GMO crops are replaced by genetically modified ones. This can have a ripple effect on the ecosystem, affecting not only the plants and animals that depend on those crops, but also the insects and microorganisms that interact with them. Additionally, the use of GMOs can also lead to the spread of genetic material to wild relatives of the crop, which can have unintended and unpredictable effects on the environment.

Furthermore, GMOs may also have negative impacts on the economy and food security. GMOs are often controlled by a small number of large corporations, which can lead to a concentration of power in the agricultural sector. This can result in higher prices for consumers, and a reduction in the diversity of crops available to farmers. Additionally, the use of GMOs can lead to the displacement of traditional farmers, who may be unable to afford the seeds and chemicals required to grow the genetically modified crops. This can have a negative impact on food security, as local farmers may no longer be able to grow the crops that are needed to feed their communities.

In conclusion, the use of genetically engineered foods poses a serious risk to humanity. While GMOs have the potential to solve some of the world's food problems, the potential negative impacts on human health, the environment, and the economy are cause for concern. It is important that we carefully consider the risks associated with GMOs, and that we take steps to minimize those risks, such as mandatory labeling and independent testing of GMOs, before they become a bigger problem.

Unions are organizations that bring together individuals with a common goal or interest, such as workers, students, or religious groups. While unions have played an important role in protecting and advancing the rights of their members, they have also been a source of controversy and conflict. In this essay, I will explore the ways in which unions can be both a friend and a foe to society.

One of the main ways in which unions can be a friend to society is by protecting and advancing the rights and interests of their members. Unions have been instrumental in securing better wages, benefits, and working conditions for workers. They have also been a powerful force for social and political change, advocating for issues such as equal pay, workplace safety, and worker's rights. Additionally, unions also provide a platform for workers to have a collective voice and representation in decision-making processes, promoting fair treatment and representation of their members.

Unions also help to create a more equitable distribution of wealth and power in society. By advocating for better wages and working conditions for their members, unions can help to reduce income inequality and promote social justice. Moreover, unions also promote fair distribution of wealth by collective bargaining, which can help to balance the power between employers and employees.

Another way in which unions can be a friend to society is by promoting economic stability and growth. Unions can help to stabilize the economy by ensuring that workers have a steady income and are able to spend money on goods and services, which in turn can drive economic growth. Additionally, unions can also help to stabilize the economy by promoting fair labor practices, which can lead to higher productivity and a more efficient workforce.

On the other hand, unions can also be a foe to society in certain situations. One of the main ways in which unions can be a foe is by promoting policies and practices that are harmful to the economy. For example, unions may demand higher wages and benefits for their members, which can lead to higher prices for goods and services and a decrease in economic growth. Additionally, unions may also promote policies that are harmful to the environment, or that are discriminatory against certain groups of people.

Moreover, unions can also be a foe to society by promoting policies that are harmful to the general public. For example, strikes and lockouts can disrupt essential services, such as transportation and healthcare, causing inconvenience and hardship for the general public. Additionally, unions may also promote policies that are harmful to the environment, or that are discriminatory against certain groups of people.

Another way in which unions can be a foe to society is by promoting policies that are harmful to the general public. Unions may use their power to influence political decisions in a way that is not in the best interest of the general public, such as by lobbying for laws and regulations that are detrimental to the economy or society as a whole. Additionally, unions may also use their power to influence the political process in a way that is not democratic or fair, such as by using their resources to support certain candidates or political parties.

In conclusion, unions can be both a friend and a foe to society. They have played an important role in protecting and advancing the rights of their members, and in promoting economic stability and growth. However, unions can also be a source of controversy and conflict, promoting policies and practices that are harmful to the economy and society. It is important for unions to be transparent and accountable to their members and to society as a whole, and for society to be aware of the potential negative impacts of unions' actions and decisions.",1
488,1069.a2.txt,HOUSE OF KICKS: THE UNDERGROUND'S ENEMY #1.,"House of Kicks, also known as HoK, is an underground organization that has gained notoriety for its illegal activities and association with organized crime. The group is known for its involvement in the illicit trade of sneakers, specifically high-end and limited edition footwear. They have been referred to as the ""enemy #1"" of the underground, due to the negative impact they have had on the communities they operate in and the legitimate businesses that operate within the sneaker industry.

HoK is believed to have originated in the early 2000s and has since grown to become a global organization. They have been linked to various criminal activities such as money laundering, fraud, and theft. They are also known to use violence and intimidation to control the market and maintain their dominance. This has led to a climate of fear among legitimate sneaker businesses and customers, who have been threatened and harassed by HoK members.

One of the main reasons HoK is seen as the enemy #1 of the underground is their involvement in the illegal trade of sneakers. The group acquires high-end and limited-edition sneakers through various illegal means, such as theft, fraud, and misrepresentation, and then resells them at exorbitant prices. This creates an unfair market, where legitimate businesses are forced to compete with illegal sellers who can offer their products at significantly lower prices. Additionally, HoK's illegal activities have been linked to the rise in sneaker-related crime, such as theft and assault.

HoK's illegal activities also harm the communities they operate in. The group is known for its association with organized crime, and is believed to have ties to gangs and other criminal organizations. This has led to an increase in violence, intimidation, and other criminal activities in the communities they operate in. Additionally, HoK's illegal activities lead to a loss of revenue for legitimate businesses, which can harm the local economy and reduce job opportunities.

Another reason HoK is seen as the enemy #1 of the underground is their impact on the legitimate sneaker industry. The group's illegal activities have led to a loss of revenue for legitimate businesses, as they are forced to compete with illegal sellers who can offer their products at significantly lower prices. This can lead to a decline in the quality of products and services, as legitimate businesses struggle to stay competitive. Additionally, HoK's illegal activities have led to a decrease in consumer trust in the sneaker industry, as customers are unable to distinguish between legitimate and counterfeit products.

In conclusion, House of Kicks (HoK) is a criminal organization that has gained notoriety for its illegal activities and association with organized crime. The group's involvement in the illicit trade of sneakers has had a negative impact on the communities they operate in, legitimate businesses and the sneaker industry as a whole. HoK's illegal activities have led to an unfair market, an increase in crime, and a loss of revenue for legitimate businesses. They have become known as the ""enemy #1"" of the underground, and their activities should be met with strong law enforcement action. To combat the negative impact of HoK, it's important to raise awareness and educate the public about their activities, as well as to support legitimate businesses and promote a culture of lawful behavior.",1
489,1070.a2.txt,Why we need marks in school.,"Marks, also known as grades, have been a fundamental part of the education system for many years. They are used to evaluate a student's performance and progress in a particular subject or course. While some may argue that marks are unnecessary and can create unnecessary stress for students, there are several reasons why they are an important aspect of the education system.

One of the main reasons why marks are necessary in school is that they provide a clear and objective measure of a student's performance. Marks give teachers and other educational professionals a way to evaluate a student's understanding of the material and their ability to apply it. This information is essential for providing appropriate support, feedback and guidance to the student, helping them to achieve their full potential. Additionally, marks also provide a way for students to track their own progress and set goals for improvement.

Marks are also an important tool for tracking student progress over time. They allow teachers and other educational professionals to monitor a student's performance and identify areas where they may need additional support or resources. This information is essential for ensuring that students are on track to meet their academic goals and that they are receiving the appropriate level of instruction and support. Additionally, marks also provide a way for students to track their own progress over time and set goals for improvement.

Another important aspect of marks is that they provide a way for students to be held accountable for their performance. Marks provide students with an incentive to work hard and put in the necessary effort to succeed. They also serve as a way for students to take responsibility for their own learning and be accountable for their own progress. This can help students to develop a sense of ownership and responsibility for their own education, which can be an important factor in their long-term success.

Marks are also essential for college and university admissions. Higher education institutions use marks as a way to evaluate a student's academic performance and determine their eligibility for admission. They also serve as an important factor in determining scholarships, grants, and other forms of financial aid. Without marks, it would be much more difficult for students to pursue higher education and achieve their goals.

Furthermore, marks also serve as a way for employers to evaluate a candidate's qualifications. Many employers consider a candidate's grades when making hiring decisions, as it can indicate the level of knowledge, skills and work ethic of the candidate. Marks can also be used as a benchmark for determining promotions and pay raises within a company.

In conclusion, marks are an essential aspect of the education system. They provide a clear and objective measure of a student's performance, track student progress over time, hold students accountable for their performance, essential for college and university admissions, and important in the job market. They are a necessary tool for teachers and other educational professionals to evaluate student's understanding of the material and their ability to apply it. While marks can create stress for students, it's important to remember that the ultimate goal of marks is to promote student learning and success in the long-term.",1
490,1072.a2.txt,"Can a democracy, claiming to accept the Human Rights, legally execute its citizens?","The question of whether a democracy, claiming to accept human rights, can legally execute its citizens is a complex and controversial one. On the one hand, many argue that the death penalty is a necessary tool for maintaining law and order and protecting society from dangerous criminals. On the other hand, there are those who argue that the death penalty is a violation of human rights, and that it is incompatible with the principles of a democratic society that claims to respect human rights.

One of the main arguments in favor of the death penalty is that it serves as a deterrent to crime. Supporters of the death penalty argue that the threat of execution can deter individuals from committing heinous crimes, such as murder, by making them aware of the severe consequences that await them if they are caught. Additionally, some argue that the death penalty is a necessary tool for protecting society from dangerous criminals, who may pose a threat to the safety and security of others even if they are incarcerated.

However, many opponents of the death penalty argue that it is a violation of human rights. The right to life is considered a fundamental human right and is protected under international law. The death penalty can be seen as a violation of this right, as it involves the state taking the life of a citizen. Additionally, the death penalty can be seen as a form of cruel and inhumane punishment, which is also prohibited under international law.

Furthermore, many argue that the death penalty is not an effective deterrent to crime. Studies have shown that the death penalty does not have a significant impact on crime rates and that other factors, such as poverty and unemployment, are more likely to contribute to crime. Moreover, there is a significant risk of wrongful convictions and execution, due to the fallibility of the criminal justice system, and the lack of transparency, and oversight which could lead to miscarriages of justice.

Another argument against the death penalty is that it is incompatible with the principles of a democratic society that claims to respect human rights. In a democracy, citizens are supposed to be",1
491,1074.a2.txt,Unemployment-Solutions to the problem,"Unemployment is a persistent problem that affects millions of people around the world. It can have a devastating impact on individuals and families, leading to poverty, social isolation, and mental health issues. However, there are a number of solutions that can be implemented to address the problem of unemployment. In this essay, I will discuss some of the most effective solutions to the problem of unemployment.

One of the most effective solutions to the problem of unemployment is job creation. Governments can create jobs by investing in public works projects, such as infrastructure development, and by providing incentives for businesses to create new jobs. For example, governments can offer tax breaks or subsidies to businesses that are willing to invest in new projects or expand their operations. Additionally, governments can also invest in education and training programs to help individuals acquire the skills and qualifications needed to secure employment in high-demand industries.

Another solution to the problem of unemployment is to improve the efficiency of the labor market. Governments can take steps to reduce the barriers to entry for new businesses, such as reducing regulations and streamlining the process for starting a new business. Additionally, governments can also work to improve the flexibility of the labor market by making it easier for businesses to hire and fire employees. By reducing the costs associated with hiring and firing, businesses will be more likely to create new jobs and expand their operations.

Another solution to the problem of unemployment is to provide support to those who are unemployed. Governments can provide unemployment benefits to individuals who are out of work, as well as financial assistance for those who are struggling to make ends meet. Additionally, governments can provide training and education programs to help individuals acquire the skills and qualifications needed to secure employment. These programs can also help to reduce the costs associated with unemployment, such as the cost of healthcare and housing.

Additionally, governments can also invest in targeted economic development strategies to help create jobs in specific regions or industries. For example, governments can invest in infrastructure development in certain regions, or provide incentives for businesses to invest in specific industries. This can help to create jobs in areas where unemployment is particularly high and where there is a need for new economic development.

Lastly, governments can also work to improve the overall economic conditions in the country. By promoting economic growth, governments can help to create new jobs and reduce unemployment. For example, governments can invest in research and development to spur innovation, promote trade and investment, and reduce taxes and regulations to make it easier for businesses to operate and create jobs.

In conclusion, the problem of unemployment is a complex one that requires a multifaceted approach. Governments can create jobs by investing in public works projects, provide support to those who are unemployed, reduce barriers to entry for new businesses, and invest in targeted economic development strategies. Additionally, governments can work to improve the overall economic conditions in the country to create new jobs and reduce unemployment. While unemployment is a challenging problem, there are solutions available, and with the right approach, it can be addressed and overcome.",1
492,1077.a2.txt,Monarchy is Feudalistic,"Monarchy is often associated with the feudalistic system, a social and economic structure that existed in medieval Europe. Feudalism was characterized by a hierarchical society, with a ruling nobility and a lower class of peasants and serfs who were bound to the land. The monarchy was the highest authority in this system, with the king or queen holding ultimate power and control over the land and its inhabitants.

One of the key features of feudalism was the system of vassalage, in which lords and nobles pledged their loyalty and service to a higher authority in exchange for land and privileges. The monarchy was at the top of this system, with lords and nobles owing allegiance and service to the king or queen. This system of vassalage created a hierarchical society, with the monarch at the top and the lords and nobles below them, followed by the peasants and serfs at the bottom.

The monarchy also played a central role in the economic system of feudalism. The king or queen held control over the land and its resources, and would grant land to lords and nobles in exchange for their loyalty and service. These lords and nobles would then use the land to produce goods and provide for their vassals, the peasants and serfs. The monarch also had the power to impose taxes and tariffs on the lords and nobles and the peasants, which were used to support the monarchy and maintain its power.

Another aspect of feudalism is the use of force to maintain control. This system of government was based on the principle of the ""divine right of kings"", which stated that the monarch's power came from God and was therefore absolute. This belief was used to justify the use of force to maintain order and control over the population. Monarchs would use their armies to enforce their will, and to put down any rebellion or resistance.

Moreover, in a feudalistic system, the Monarchy also played a significant role in the legal system. The monarch would often act as the final court of appeal and had the power to grant pardons and amnesty. This gave the monarchy a great deal of control over the legal system and the ability to influence the outcome of legal cases.

However, it's important to note that not all monarchies were feudalistic and there were different variations of monarchies throughout history. Some have been constitutional monarchies, where the monarch's powers are limited by a constitution, and the monarch acts as a symbolic figurehead, while others have been absolute monarchies, where the monarch holds more power. Furthermore, the term feudalism is used to describe a system that existed in medieval Europe, and it is not necessarily applicable to other societies or cultures where a monarchy existed.

In conclusion, monarchy is often associated with the feudalistic system that existed in medieval Europe, as it shares some similarities with it. The monarchy was at the top of the hierarchical society, held control over the land and its resources, imposed taxes, used force to maintain control and played a significant role in the legal system. However, it's important to note that not all monarchies were feudalistic and there were different variations of monarchies throughout history, and it is not necessarily applicable to other societies or cultures where a monarchy existed.",1
493,1078.a2.txt,Democrasy-it is in your hands,"Democracy is a form of government in which power is held by the people, either directly or through elected representatives. It is a system of government that is built on the principles of equality, freedom, and participation. In a democracy, citizens have the right to vote and to participate in the political process, and the government is accountable to the people it serves.

One of the key principles of democracy is that it is in the hands of the people. This means that citizens have the power to shape the direction of their country and to hold their government accountable. This can be done through the act of voting, where citizens have the opportunity to elect their representatives, and through participation in the political process, such as attending town hall meetings, joining political organizations, and organizing grassroots campaigns.

Another important aspect of democracy is that it promotes equality. In a democracy, all citizens have an equal right to participate in the political process and to have their voices heard. This means that everyone has an equal say in the decisions that affect their lives, regardless of their race, gender, religion, or social status.

Additionally, democracy promotes freedom. In a democracy, citizens have the freedom to express themselves, to associate with whomever they choose, and to participate in the political process without fear of reprisal. This freedom allows citizens to hold their government accountable, to advocate for change, and to shape the direction of their country.

The responsibility of maintaining a democracy also lies in the hands of the citizens. In a democracy, it's important for citizens to be informed and engaged in the political process. This means that citizens should stay informed about the issues and candidates, participate in elections and civic activities, and hold their elected officials accountable. Additionally, citizens can also work to promote democracy by encouraging others to participate in the political process, and by supporting organizations and movements that promote democratic values.

However, it's important to note that democracy is not a perfect system and it has its own challenges and limitations. One of the main challenges of democracy is that it requires the active participation of citizens. If citizens are not informed or engaged, then democracy can become ineffective and the government may not be accountable to the citizens. Additionally, democracy can also be undermined by corruption, lack of transparency, and the influence of special interest groups.

Another challenge of democracy is that it can be difficult to achieve consensus on important issues. In a democracy, there are often multiple perspectives and opinions, and it can be difficult to find common ground and achieve a majority decision. This can lead to gridlock and can make it difficult for the government to take action on important issues.

In conclusion, democracy is a form of government in which power is held by the people, either directly or through elected representatives. It is a system of government that is built on the principles of equality, freedom, and participation. In a democracy, citizens have the power to shape the direction of their country, and the government is accountable to the people it serves. However, democracy is not a perfect system, and it requires the active participation of citizens and it has its own challenges and limitations. It's important for citizens to take an active role in maintaining democracy by staying informed, participating in the political process and holding elected officials accountable. In the end, democracy is in the hands of the people, and it's up to citizens to make it work.",1
494,1081.a2.txt,STOP THE GRADING IN PHYSICAL-EDUCATION!!,"Grading physical education classes has been a contentious issue for many years. Some argue that grades in physical education classes are unnecessary and can create unnecessary stress for students, while others argue that grades are an important tool for evaluating student performance and progress. In this essay, I will explore the arguments for and against grading physical education classes and why it is important to stop the grading in physical education classes.

One of the main arguments against grading physical education classes is that it can create unnecessary stress for students. Physical education classes are often seen as a way for students to relax and have fun, and grading can take away from this experience. Additionally, many students may not be naturally skilled at physical activities and could feel discouraged if they are not performing well. This can lead to students becoming less interested in physical education and being less likely to participate in physical activities in the future.

Furthermore, grading physical education classes can also be unfair and subjective. Physical education classes often involve activities that are not easily quantifiable, such as team sports or dance. This makes it difficult to assign grades that are based on objective criteria, and it can be challenging for teachers to evaluate student performance accurately. Additionally, grading physical education classes can also be influenced by factors such as personal biases and previous experiences, which can lead to an unfair and inconsistent evaluation of student performance.

Another argument against grading physical education classes is that it can discourage students from participating in physical activities. If students are not performing well, they may become discouraged and less likely to participate in physical activities. This can be particularly detrimental to students who are overweight or have a chronic health condition, as physical activity is an important part of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

Moreover, physical education classes should be focused on teaching students the importance of being physically active, developing physical literacy and learning the skills needed to be active throughout their lifetime. Grading physical education classes can shift the focus away from learning and towards performance and competition. This is not the primary goal of physical education classes, and it can lead to students not learning the skills they need to be physically active throughout their life.

On the other hand, some argue that grading physical education classes is an important tool for evaluating student performance and progress. Grades can provide students with feedback on their performance and help them to set goals for improvement. Additionally, grades can also provide teachers with a way to track student progress over time and to identify areas where students may need additional support or resources.

However, it's important to note that there are other ways to evaluate student performance and progress in physical education classes, such as formative assessments, self-reflection and self-assessments. These methods can provide valuable feedback on student performance without the negative effects of grading. Additionally, teachers can also use other methods to track student progress, such as observing students during class, keeping a record of student participation, and providing verbal feedback to students.

In conclusion, grading physical education classes is a contentious issue, and there are valid arguments for and against it. However, it's important to note that grading physical education classes can create unnecessary stress for students, can be unfair and subjective and can discourage students from participating in physical activities. Additionally, it can also shift the focus away from learning the importance of being physically active and developing physical literacy. Instead, other methods such as formative assessments, self-reflection and self-assessments should be used to evaluate student performance and progress, and to track student progress over time. It is essential to stop the grading in physical education classes to ensure that students are learning the skills they need to be physically active throughout their life.",1
495,1088.a2.txt,"Mother, Father, Child: Mother, Mother, Child","The relationship between a mother, father, and child is a complex and multifaceted one that can have a profound impact on the child's development and well-being. In this essay, I will focus on the unique role of the mother in this relationship and why it is important for the mother to be present and involved in the child's life.

One of the most important roles of the mother is to provide emotional support and nurturing to the child. From the moment of birth, the mother is responsible for meeting the child's basic needs, such as feeding, bathing, and providing comfort. As the child grows, the mother continues to play a vital role in providing emotional support, such as listening to the child's problems, offering advice, and providing a safe and loving environment. The mother's role as the primary caregiver and emotional support system helps to shape the child's self-esteem and emotional well-being.

Another important role of the mother is to provide guidance and instruction to the child. Mothers play a key role in teaching children about the world around them, helping them to develop their cognitive and social skills, and providing them with the tools they need to navigate the world. This can include teaching the child about their environment, helping them to develop their language and communication skills, and teaching them about healthy relationships.

Moreover, mothers also play a crucial role in building a strong and healthy bond with their child. Studies have shown that children who have a strong bond with their mother are more likely to have better mental and physical health, higher self-esteem, and greater academic success. This bond is also vital to the child's sense of identity, providing them with a sense of security and belonging.

However, it's important to note that the role of the mother is not the only important one in the relationship between a mother, father, and child. The father also plays a vital role in the child's development and well-being, providing a different perspective and set of skills. A father can provide children with a sense of security and stability, and can be a positive role model for children, teaching them about the importance of hard work, responsibility, and discipline. Additionally, a child can benefit from having both parents involved in their lives, as they can provide different perspectives, emotional support, and guidance, which can contribute to a child's overall well-being.

However, there are situations where the mother is the only parent in the child's life, and it's crucial for the mother to understand and accept the responsibilities that come with being a single parent. Being a single mother can be challenging and overwhelming, and it's important for the mother to take the time to take care of herself, both physically and emotionally, in order to be able to provide the best possible care for her child.

In conclusion, the relationship between a mother, father, and child is a complex and multifaceted one that can have a profound impact on the child's development and well-being. The mother plays a vital role in this relationship, providing emotional support, guidance, and instruction to the child. Additionally, the mother plays a crucial role in building a strong and healthy bond with their child. However, it's important to note that the role of the mother is not the only important one in the relationship between a",1
496,1090.a2.txt,Experimenting with and research on animals,"Experimenting with and researching on animals is a highly controversial topic that has been debated for many years. On one hand, animal experimentation and research is seen as a necessary tool for advancing scientific knowledge and developing new treatments and therapies for human and animal diseases. On the other hand, many people argue that animal experimentation is cruel and inhumane, and that alternative methods should be used instead. In this essay, I will examine both sides of the debate and explore the ethical and scientific considerations surrounding animal experimentation and research.

One of the main arguments in favor of animal experimentation is that it is essential for advancing scientific knowledge and developing new treatments and therapies. Animal experimentation has played a critical role in many scientific breakthroughs, including the development of vaccines, antibiotics, and cancer treatments. Animal models are often used to study diseases and test new treatments because they share many similarities with humans, and the results of animal studies can provide valuable insights into human physiology.

Additionally, animal experimentation and research are also necessary for product safety testing. Many consumer goods, including cosmetics, drugs, and food additives, are tested on animals to ensure that they are safe for human use. This helps to protect consumers from potentially harmful products and to ensure that new products are safe before they are released to the market.

Another argument in favor of animal experimentation is that it can lead to the development of treatments and therapies that are not only beneficial for humans but also for animals. For example, research on animals has led to the development of new treatments for diseases that affect both humans and animals, such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Additionally, research on animals has also led to the development of new treatments for animal-specific diseases, such as those that affect livestock.

However, there are also strong arguments against animal experimentation. One of the main criticisms is that it is cruel and inhumane. Many people argue that animals used in",1
497,1092.a2.txt,IRC vs. IRL?,"IRC (Internet Relay Chat) and IRL (In Real Life) are two concepts that are often used to distinguish between online and offline communication. IRC refers to communication that takes place on the internet, such as through chat rooms, forums, and social media platforms, while IRL refers to communication that takes place in person. In this essay, I will explore the similarities and differences between IRC and IRL, and the impact that each has on our social interactions and relationships.

One of the main differences between IRC and IRL is the level of anonymity that is possible. IRC allows users to communicate anonymously, or under a pseudonym, which can make it easier for people to express themselves and communicate with others without fear of judgment or rejection. In contrast, IRL communication typically requires individuals to reveal their true identity, which can make it more difficult for some people to communicate or form relationships.

Another difference between IRC and IRL is the level of control that users have over their interactions. In IRC, users have more control over the pace and flow of their conversations, as well as the ability to ignore or block other users. In contrast, IRL communication often requires individuals to respond to others in real-time, and there is less control over the interactions and interactions can be more unpredictable.

Additionally, IRC allows for a wider range of interactions and connections. Through the internet, people can communicate with others from all over the world, regardless of location or time zone. This can be particularly beneficial for people who live in remote areas or who have difficulty forming connections in their local community. In contrast, IRL interactions are typically limited to the people and places that an individual has access to in their immediate vicinity.

On the other hand, IRL interactions can be more meaningful and personal, as they often involve nonverbal cues such as body language, facial expressions and tone of voice, which can be more difficult to convey through IRC. Additionally, IRL interactions also have a sense of immediacy and tangible presence, which can lead to a deeper understanding of the other person.

However, it's important to note that both IRC and IRL have their own advantages and disadvantages, and that both can be valuable in different ways. IRC can be a powerful tool for connecting with others, building relationships, and forming communities, while IRL can be more meaningful and personal. Additionally, the use of both IRC and IRL can complement each other and can help individuals to build and maintain relationships in both online and offline settings.

In conclusion, IRC and IRL are two concepts that are often used to distinguish between online and offline communication. IRC refers to communication that takes place on the internet, while IRL refers to communication that takes place in person. While both have their own advantages and disadvantages, the use of both IRC and IRL can complement each other and can help individuals to",1
498,1094.a2.txt,Yes to no smoking,"Smoking is a serious public health concern that has been linked to a wide range of health problems, including lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory illness. Despite the known risks associated with smoking, many people continue to smoke and the use of tobacco products remains prevalent in many parts of the world. In this essay, I will argue that we should say ""yes"" to no smoking, and explore the reasons why it is important to promote policies that discourage smoking and help smokers quit.

One of the main reasons to say ""yes"" to no smoking is that smoking is a leading cause of preventable death and illness. According to the World Health Organization, tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death worldwide, and is responsible for over 8 million deaths each year. Smoking is also a major risk factor for a wide range of health problems, including lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory illness, which can lead to significant suffering and disability.

Another important reason to say ""yes"" to no smoking is that smoking is a major public health concern that affects not just smokers, but also those around them. Secondhand smoke is a serious health hazard, and is known to cause lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory illness in non-smokers. Additionally, smoking is a major contributor to indoor air pollution, which can be especially harmful to children and individuals with respiratory conditions.

Additionally, smoking also has significant economic and societal costs. The health care costs associated with smoking are staggering, and can place a significant burden on healthcare systems and governments. Additionally, smoking can also lead to decreased productivity and increased absenteeism, which can have a negative impact on the economy.

To combat the negative impacts of smoking, there are a number of policy measures that can be implemented to discourage smoking and help smokers quit. One of the most effective measures is increasing the price of cigarettes through taxes. Higher cigarette prices have been shown to be an effective deterrent to smoking, particularly among youth, and can also provide an important source of revenue for governments.

Another effective policy measure is implementing smoking bans in public spaces. Such bans can help to reduce exposure to secondhand smoke, and make it less likely that people will start smoking in the first place. Additionally, governments and organizations can also invest in education and outreach programs that help to raise awareness about the risks associated with smoking and the benefits of quitting.

Furthermore, it's important to provide access to cessation programs that help smokers quit. Nicotine replacement therapy, counseling and prescription medications are some of the most effective ways to help smokers quit, and these programs should be widely available and affordable.

In conclusion, smoking is a serious public health concern that has been linked to a wide range of health problems, including lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory illness. Despite the known risks associated with smoking, many people continue to smoke and the use of tobacco products remains prevalent in many parts of the world. It's important for individuals and governments to say ""yes"" to no smoking, and implement policies that discourage smoking and help smokers quit.

While genetic engineering has the potential to bring about many benefits, such as the development of new treatments for diseases and the creation of more efficient and resilient crops, there are also concerns about the ethical and safety implications of this technology. In this essay, I will argue that we should stay away from genetically modifying our genes and explore the reasons why it is important to be cautious when it comes to genetic engineering.

One of the main reasons to stay away from genetically modifying our genes is that it is not yet fully understood how genetic engineering will affect the long-term health and well-being of individuals and populations. Genetic engineering can have unintended consequences, such as the creation of new diseases or the development of resistance to existing treatments. Additionally, genetic engineering can also have unintended environmental effects, such as the creation of superweeds or the displacement of native species.

Another important reason to stay away from genetically modifying our genes is that it raises ethical concerns about the manipulation of life at its most basic level. Genetic engineering can be used to create ""designer babies"" that are tailored to meet specific physical or intellectual characteristics, which raises questions about the implications for human dignity and equality. Additionally, genetic engineering also raises concerns about the potential for the creation of a ""genetic underclass"" or ""genetic elite"", which would have significant social and economic implications.

Furthermore, Genetic engineering can also be used for non-therapeutic purposes, such as creating animals for food production or for use in research, which raises questions about the welfare of these animals and the implications for human-animal relationships.

Additionally, genetic engineering can also have significant economic implications, particularly for small farmers and developing countries. The development and patenting of genetically modified crops can lead to the displacement of small farmers and the concentration of power and control in the hands of a few large corporations. Additionally, the use of genetically modified crops in developing countries can lead to dependence on foreign technology and the erosion of traditional farming practices.

To address these concerns, it is important to implement regulations that provide oversight and oversight and control over genetic engineering. This includes regulations that ensure the safety and efficacy of genetically modified products, as well as regulations that prevent the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment without proper testing and oversight. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the rights and welfare of animals are protected and that the use of genetic engineering is consistent with ethical principles and values.

In conclusion, genetic engineering is a powerful technology with the potential to bring about many benefits, but it also raises serious concerns about the long-term health and well-being of individuals and populations, as well as ethical and safety implications. It is important to stay away from genetically modifying our genes and to be cautious when it comes to genetic engineering. This includes implementing regulations that provide oversight and control over genetic engineering, as well as ensuring that the rights and welfare of animals are protected and that the use of genetic engineering is consistent with ethical principles and values.",1
500,1097.a2.txt,Are you to decide about life or death?,"The question of whether or not an individual has the right to decide about life or death is a complex and deeply personal one that has been the subject of much debate and discussion. On one hand, many people argue that individuals have the right to autonomy and self-determination, and that this includes the right to make decisions about their own health and well-being, including the decision to end their own life. On the other hand, many people argue that the right to life is a fundamental human right that should not be infringed upon, and that decisions about life and death should be left to medical professionals and the legal system. In this essay, I will explore the ethical and legal implications of the right to decide about life or death, and the role of autonomy and self-determination in this debate.

One of the main arguments in favor of the right to decide about life or death is that individuals have the right to autonomy and self-determination. This includes the right to make decisions about their own health and well-being, including the decision to end their own life. This argument is often made in the context of end-of-life care and the right to die, with many people arguing that individuals should have the right to make decisions about their own death if they are suffering from a terminal illness or are in a permanent vegetative state.

Additionally, the right to autonomy and self-determination can also be applied to the decision to seek medical treatment or to refuse it. Many people argue that individuals should have the right to make decisions about their own health, including the decision to refuse medical treatment if they believe it will not be beneficial.

Another important argument in favor of the right to decide about life or death is that it can help to alleviate suffering and improve the quality of life for individuals who are terminally ill or in a permanent vegetative state. For some people, the decision to end their own life can be the most compassionate and humane choice, as it can provide them with a sense of control and dignity at the end of their lives.

However, there are also strong arguments against the right to decide about life or death. One of the main criticisms is that it can be used to justify the taking of innocent lives, particularly in the case of assisted suicide and euthanasia. Additionally, some people argue that the decision to end one's own life can be influenced by emotional or psychological factors, such as depression or hopelessness, and that individuals may not be in a state of mind to make rational and informed decisions about their own death.

Moreover, it's important to consider the role of the legal system and medical professionals in decisions about life and death. Many people argue that decisions about life and death should be left to the legal system, which can provide oversight and ensure that the rights and welfare of individuals are protected. Additionally, many people argue that decisions about life and death should be left to medical professionals, who are trained and qualified to make decisions about health and well-being.

In conclusion, the question of whether or not an individual has the right to decide about life or death is a complex and deeply personal one that has been the subject of much debate and discussion. While many people argue that individuals have the right to autonomy and self-determination, including the right to make decisions about their own health and well-being, including the decision to end their own life, it is important to consider the ethical and legal implications of this right and the",1
501,1098.a2.txt,"In the name of Religion, you can get away with anything!","Religion has been used throughout history as a justification for a wide range of actions, both good and bad. While religion can provide a sense of meaning, purpose, and community, it can also be used as a tool to justify discrimination, violence, and other harmful actions. In this essay, I will argue that in the name of religion, some individuals and groups can use it as a tool to justify their actions and escape accountability, and explore the reasons why this is a problem.

One of the main reasons why religion can be used to justify harmful actions is that it can be used to legitimize discrimination and violence against marginalized groups. Throughout history, religion has been used to justify discrimination and violence against groups such as women, minorities, and LGBTQ+ individuals, on the basis of the belief that their beliefs and practices are morally inferior. This can lead to the oppression and marginalization of these groups, and can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and prejudices.

Another problem with using religion as a justification for harmful actions is that it can be used to evade accountability and responsibility. When individuals and groups use religion to justify their actions, they can use it as a shield to protect themselves from criticism and accountability. This can make it difficult to hold them accountable for their actions, and can allow them to continue to perpetrate harmful actions without consequence.

Additionally, using religion as a justification for harmful actions can also lead to the erosion of civil liberties and the restriction of human rights. When the government and the religious institutions are intertwined, it can lead to the violation of human rights, such as the restriction of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of expression. This can lead to a restriction of the rights of individuals and groups, and can perpetuate harmful ideologies and practices.

Moreover, using religion as a justification for harmful actions can also perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misconceptions about certain groups. By using religion as a tool to justify discriminatory actions, individuals and groups can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misconceptions about certain groups, which can lead to further discrimination and marginalization.

To address these issues, it's important to promote a culture of accountability and responsibility, and to hold individuals and groups accountable for their actions, regardless of the religion they use to justify it. This includes the establishment of laws and policies that prohibit discrimination and violence based on religion, as well as the promotion of education and awareness campaigns that challenge harmful stereotypes and misconceptions. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the rights and welfare of marginalized groups are protected, and to provide support and resources to help these groups overcome discrimination and marginalization.

In conclusion, religion can be used as a tool to justify harmful actions, and some individuals and groups can use it as a tool to escape accountability and evade responsibility for their actions. This is a problem because it can lead to discrimination, violence, and the erosion of civil liberties and human rights. To address this issue, it's important to promote a culture of accountability and responsibility, and to hold individuals and groups accountable for their actions, regardless of the religion they use to justify it.

502,1099.a2.txt,Mass Media and Privacy,"Mass media, including television, radio, newspapers, and the internet, have become an integral part of modern society, providing a constant stream of information and entertainment to billions of people around the world. However, with the rise of mass media also comes a growing concern about privacy and the way in which personal information is collected, shared, and used. In this essay, I will explore the relationship between mass media and privacy, and the ways in which mass media can both protect and threaten personal privacy.

One of the main ways in which mass media can threaten privacy is through the collection and sharing of personal information. With the growth of the internet and social media, it has become increasingly easy for companies and organizations to collect vast amounts of personal data, such as browsing history, location data, and social media activity. This information can then be used for targeted advertising, political campaigns, and other purposes without the individual's consent or knowledge. This can lead to a loss of privacy and control over one's personal information.

Another way in which mass media can threaten privacy is through the dissemination of sensitive information. In the past, traditional news organizations have been known to reveal the identities of victims of crime, share sensitive information about political figures, and publish personal information about private citizens. This can lead to a loss of privacy and can also have serious consequences for the individual, such as damaging their reputation, putting them at risk of harm, or even endangering their life.

Furthermore, Mass media can also perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misinformation about certain groups, which can lead to discrimination and marginalization. This can also be seen on how certain individuals or groups are portrayed in the media, which can reinforce harmful stereotypes and contribute to the marginalization of certain groups.

On the other hand, mass media can

503,1100.a2.txt,Obsessed Parents,"Parenting is a challenging and rewarding experience, but for some parents, the desire to be the perfect parent can lead to obsession. Obsessed parents are fixated on the belief that they must do everything in their power to ensure their child's success, often at the expense of their own well-being and the well-being of their child. In this essay, I will explore the issue of obsessed parents, the reasons why some parents become obsessed, and the ways in which obsession can harm both parents and children.

One of the main reasons why some parents become obsessed is the pressure to be the perfect parent. In today's society, there is a great deal of pressure on parents to raise successful, well-rounded children who excel academically, athletically, and socially. This pressure can lead some parents to become fixated on ensuring their child's success, often at the expense of their own well-being and the well-being of their child.

Another reason why some parents become obsessed is the fear of failure. Many parents believe that their child's success is a reflection of their own success as a parent, and fear that their child's failure will be seen as their own failure. This fear can lead some parents to become overly involved in their child's life, micromanaging their activities, and pushing them to excel in every area.

Additionally, some parents become obsessed with their child's well-being due to past experiences, such as their own childhood, mental health issues, or traumatic experiences. They may have grown up in an environment where they didn't feel safe, loved, or secure, and as a result, they become overly protective of their child in the present, often not realizing the negative impact this may have on their child's development and well-being.

However, obsession can have harmful effects on both parents and children. For parents, obsession can lead to stress, anxiety, and depression, and can also negatively impact their relationships with their partner and other family members. Additionally, obsession can also lead to burnout and fatigue, which can prevent parents from being able to provide the support and guidance their child needs.

For children, obsession can lead to a lack of autonomy and self-esteem, and can also negatively impact their mental and physical health. Children of obsessed parents may feel suffocated, controlled and not trusted, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. They may also experience feelings of anxiety, depression and may develop a fear of failure, which can prevent them from reaching their full potential.

To address the issue of obsessed parenting, it's important for parents to be aware of the potential risks and to find a healthy balance between being supportive and being overbearing. This includes setting appropriate boundaries and allowing children",1
504,1102.a2.txt,Euthanasia - a legal way out?,"Euthanasia, also known as assisted suicide, is the practice of intentionally ending a person's life in order to relieve suffering. While euthanasia is a complex and controversial issue, it has been the subject of much debate and discussion, with some people arguing that it should be legalized as a way to provide relief for those suffering from terminal illness or chronic pain. Others argue that euthanasia is morally wrong and should be prohibited. In this essay, I will explore the issue of euthanasia and the arguments for and against its legalization as a legal way out.

One of the main arguments in favor of legalizing euthanasia is that it can provide relief for those suffering from terminal illness or chronic pain. For some people, the suffering caused by their illness is unbearable, and they may wish to end their life in order to end their suffering. Legalizing euthanasia would allow these individuals to die with dignity and without suffering, and would provide them with the option of choosing the time and manner of their death.

Another argument in favor of legalizing euthanasia is that it can provide greater autonomy and self-determination for individuals. Many people argue that individuals have the right to make decisions about their own health and well-being, and that this includes the right to make decisions about the end of their life. Legalizing euthanasia would allow individuals to make these decisions for themselves, rather than leaving them in the hands of medical professionals or the legal system.

Additionally, some argue that legalizing euthanasia would lead to better end-of-life care and would free up resources that could be used to help others. If individuals have the option of ending their suffering through euthanasia, they would be less likely to prolong their suffering, and would free up resources that could be used to help others. This would lead to a more efficient use of resources and would help to ensure that all individuals are able to receive the best possible care.

However, there are also strong arguments against legalizing euthanasia. One of the main criticisms is that it can be used to justify the taking of innocent lives, particularly in the case of assisted suicide. Additionally, some people argue that the decision to end one's own life can be influenced by emotional or psychological factors, such as depression or hopelessness, and that individuals may not be in a state of mind to make rational and informed decisions about their own death.

Moreover, legalizing euthanasia can also lead to a slippery slope, where it can be used for non-terminal illnesses and disability, leading to the devaluation of human life. Additionally, it can also create a situation where some individuals would be pressured to end their lives, due to the financial burden they impose on the society or their family.

Furthermore, legalizing euthanasia can also lead to the erosion of trust between patients and healthcare professionals, as well as the erosion of trust in the healthcare system as a whole. If individuals believe that healthcare professionals are willing to end their lives, they may be less likely to trust them",1
505,1103.a2.txt,The winner of the battle between glasses and contact lenses: glasses.,"The battle between glasses and contact lenses has been ongoing for decades, with each side having its own advantages and disadvantages. While contact lenses have become increasingly popular in recent years, glasses remain the clear winner in terms of functionality, durability, and overall convenience. In this essay, I will explore the reasons why glasses are the better option when compared to contact lenses.

One of the main reasons why glasses are the better option is that they are more durable. Glasses are made from materials that are resistant to breaking and scratching, such as plastic or metal frames and lenses made from glass or plastic. On the other hand, contact lenses are made from a thin, delicate material that can be easily damaged, particularly if not handled and stored properly. Additionally, contact lenses have to be replaced regularly, which can be costly in the long run.

Another advantage of glasses is that they are more convenient to use. Glasses are easy to put on and take off, and can be worn for extended periods of time without causing discomfort. Contact lenses, on the other hand, require a certain level of care and maintenance, such as cleaning, soaking and replacement. They can also cause discomfort, dryness and redness when worn for an extended period of time, and they also require regular visits to the optometrist to ensure they fit properly.

Additionally, glasses also provide better protection for the eyes. Glasses have lenses that can block UV rays, glare and other harmful light, protecting the eyes from damage. Contact lenses do not provide the same level of protection, as they only cover the front of the eye and do not protect the surrounding area.

Furthermore, glasses are also more versatile than contact lenses. Glasses can be worn for any occasion and can be customized to suit different styles and preferences. They can be worn with different types of clothing and for different activities, such as sports, reading, and computer work. Contact lenses, on the other hand, are not as versatile and are not suitable for certain activities such as swimming or contact sports.

Moreover, glasses are also more affordable than contact lenses. Glasses are a one-time purchase, while contact lenses require regular replacement and maintenance, which can be costly in the long run. Additionally, glasses do not require regular visits to the optometrist, which can also be costly.

In conclusion, glasses are the clear winner in the battle between glasses and contact lenses. They are more durable, more convenient, provide better protection for the eyes, are more versatile, and are more affordable. While contact lenses have their own advantages, such as the fact that they're not visible, they cannot match the overall functionality, durability and convenience of glasses. Therefore, glasses are the better option for those looking for a reliable and long-term solution for their vision needs.",1
506,1104.a2.txt,Stop the use of genetic engineering.,"Genetic engineering, also known as genetic modification, is the process of manipulating the genetic makeup of an organism to change its characteristics. It is used in a variety of fields, including agriculture, medicine, and biotechnology, and has the potential to revolutionize the way we live. However, with the increasing use of genetic engineering comes a growing concern about the potential risks and negative consequences of this technology. In this essay, I will argue that the use of genetic engineering should be stopped, and I will explore the reasons why this is necessary.

One of the main reasons why genetic engineering should be stopped is that it can have negative consequences on the environment. Genetic engineering can lead to the release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into the environment, which can have a detrimental effect on ecosystems and biodiversity. GMOs can crossbreed with wild relatives, creating new species that are not found in nature, and can also disrupt the balance of ecosystems, leading to the extinction of native species.

Another reason why genetic engineering should be stopped is that it can have negative consequences for human health. Genetic engineering can lead to the creation of new diseases and infections, which can be difficult or impossible to treat. Additionally, genetic engineering can also lead to the development of new allergens and toxins, which can have harmful effects on human health.

Additionally, genetic engineering can also lead to the development of new forms of inequality and discrimination. It can create new forms of social and economic disparities, particularly between those who can afford to access these technologies and those who cannot. Furthermore, genetic engineering can also lead to the devaluation of human life, and can be used to justify eugenics and other discriminatory practices.

Moreover, genetic engineering can also lead to the erosion of traditional cultures and the loss of traditional knowledge. Genetic engineering can lead to the loss of traditional crop varieties and farming practices, which can have a detrimental effect on local communities and traditional cultures. Additionally, genetic engineering can also lead to the loss of traditional knowledge about plant breeding and crop management, which can have a negative impact on food security and food sovereignty.

Furthermore, the use of genetic engineering can also lead to the loss of genetic diversity, which is essential for the survival of life on earth. Genetic diversity is the variation of genes within a population, which is important for the survival of species, allowing them to adapt to changing environments. Genetic engineering can lead to the loss of genetic diversity, which can have a negative impact on the survival of species and the health of ecosystems.

To address these issues, it's important to stop the use of genetic engineering, and to focus on alternative approaches, such as organic farming, agroecology, and traditional knowledge. This includes the development of policies and regulations that prohibit the release of GMOs into the environment, and the promotion of research and education that focuses on alternative approaches. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the rights and welfare of marginalized communities are protected, and to provide support and resources to help these communities overcome the negative effects of genetic engineering.

In conclusion, genetic engineering is a powerful technology that has the potential to revolutionize the way we live, but it also poses significant risks and negative consequences. To protect the environment, human health, and traditional cultures, it is necessary to stop the use of genetic engineering and focus on alternative approaches. It is important to focus on the protection of genetic diversity, and the rights and welfare of marginalized communities, and to provide support and resources to",1
507,1105.a2.txt,IMPRISONED MOTHERS: A THREAT TO SOCIETY!/?,"The incarceration of mothers has a significant impact on families and communities, and it is a threat to society. Mothers are the primary caregivers for their children and their absence can have a significant and long-term impact on their children's development, well-being, and future opportunities. In this essay, I will explore the issue of imprisoned mothers, the reasons why mothers are disproportionately affected by incarceration, and the ways in which this issue is a threat to society.

One of the main reasons why mothers are disproportionately affected by incarceration is that they are often the primary caregivers for their children. When a mother is imprisoned, her children may be left without proper care and support, leading to a range of negative consequences, including emotional and behavioral problems, poor academic performance, and increased likelihood of future involvement in the criminal justice system. Furthermore, Children of incarcerated mothers may also experience discrimination, and social stigma, as well as economic hardship, which can further add to their difficulties.

Another reason why mothers are disproportionately affected by incarceration is that they are more likely to be imprisoned for non-violent offenses, such as drug offenses, and they are often the primary breadwinners for their families. This means that their incarceration can have a significant impact on the economic well-being of their families, which can lead to poverty, homelessness, and other social problems.

Additionally, the incarceration of mothers can lead to a range of negative consequences for communities. Incarcerated mothers are often separated from their families and communities, which can lead to a breakdown in social connections and support networks. This can have a detrimental effect on the well-being of families and communities and can lead to increased crime and social problems.

Furthermore, the incarceration of mothers can also lead to a loss of human capital, as mothers are often the primary caregivers for their children and their absence can have a significant impact on their children's development, well-being, and future opportunities. This can lead to a loss of potential future leaders, educators, and other productive members of society.

Moreover, the incarceration of mothers can also perpetuate cycles of poverty, crime, and recidivism. Children of incarcerated mothers are more likely to experience poverty, poor academic performance, and behavioral problems, which can increase their likelihood of future involvement in the criminal justice system. This can lead to a cycle of poverty, crime, and recidivism, which can have a significant impact on communities and society as a whole.

To address the issue of imprisoned mothers, it's important to implement policies and programs that focus on alternatives to incarceration, such as diversion programs, community supervision, and treatment programs. These alternatives can help to reduce the number of mothers who are incarcerated and can help to mitigate the negative consequences of incarceration for mothers and their families. Furthermore, the provision of re-entry services for mothers and their families can also help to reduce recidivism and improve the well-being of families and communities.

In conclusion, the incarceration of mothers is a significant",1
508,1106.a2.txt,Life on other planets:fiction or fact?,"The question of whether or not life exists on other planets has long been a topic of debate and speculation. While the existence of extraterrestrial life is still a matter of speculation, advances in technology and the discovery of new exoplanets have led to an increased interest in this topic. In this essay, I will explore the question of life on other planets, discussing the current state of scientific research and evidence, as well as the potential implications of the discovery of extraterrestrial life.

One of the main arguments in favor of the possibility of extraterrestrial life is the sheer number of exoplanets that have been discovered in recent years. The discovery of thousands of exoplanets, many of which are in the ""habitable zone"" where conditions are believed to be suitable for life, has led many scientists to believe that the likelihood of extraterrestrial life is high. Additionally, the discovery of microbial life on Mars and the subsurface ocean on Europa, a moon of Jupiter, have also given scientists reason to believe that life may exist on other planets.

Another argument in favor of the possibility of extraterrestrial life is the idea of ""abiogenesis"" or the natural emergence of life from non-living matter. This theory states that the conditions for life to emerge may be common in the universe, and that it is likely that life may have emerged independently on other planets as well.

Additionally, the discovery of extraterrestrial life would have significant implications for our understanding of the universe, as well as for our sense of place in it. The discovery of extraterrestrial life would indicate that we are not alone in the universe, and would raise many new questions about the nature of life and its origins.

However, there are also arguments against the possibility of extraterrestrial life. One of the main arguments is that the conditions necessary for the emergence of life may be extremely rare, and that the probability of life emerging independently on other planets is low. Additionally, the lack of evidence for extraterrestrial life, despite decades of searching, has led some scientists to believe that the probability of extraterrestrial life is low.

Another argument against the possibility of extraterrestrial life is that the conditions necessary for the emergence of life may be unique to Earth, and that life may be a rare and unique occurrence in the universe. Additionally, the lack of evidence of advanced extraterrestrial civilizations, despite decades of searching, has led some scientists to believe that the probability of advanced extraterrestrial life is low.

Despite the ongoing debate over the possibility of extraterrestrial life, the search for life beyond Earth continues. Advances in technology and the discovery of new exoplanets have led to an increased interest in this topic, and scientists continue to search for evidence of life on other planets. While the question of life on other planets remains a matter of speculation, it is an important topic for scientific research and discovery.

In conclusion, the question of whether or not life exists on other planets is a topic of ongoing debate and speculation. While the existence of extraterrestrial life is still a matter of speculation, advances in technology and the discovery of new exoplanets have led to an increased interest in this topic. While we may not have concrete evidence of extraterrestrial life yet, the search continues and the discovery of extraterrestrial life would have significant implications for our understanding of the universe, as well as for our sense of place in it.",1
509,1109.a2.txt,Children need a mother and a father,"The traditional family structure, which consists of a mother and a father, has long been considered the ideal environment for raising children. The mother and father provide different but complementary roles in the development and well-being of children. In this essay, I will explore the reasons why children need a mother and a father, and the ways in which having both parents present can impact the development of children.

One of the main reasons why children need a mother and a father is that the two sexes provide different, but complementary, parenting styles. Mothers and fathers tend to have different approaches to childrearing, and this can provide children with a well-rounded and balanced upbringing. For example, mothers tend to be more nurturing and emotionally expressive, while fathers tend to be more involved in activities and discipline. This can provide children with a balance of warmth and structure that is important for their emotional and psychological development.

Another reason why children need a mother and a father is that having both parents present can provide children with a positive role model of both sexes. Children learn through observation and imitation, and having both a mother and a father present can provide children with positive role models of both sexes, which can help them to form healthy relationships and understand the roles and expectations of men and women in society.

Additionally, having both a mother and a father present can provide children with a sense of security and stability. Children thrive in stable environments, and having both parents present can provide children with a sense of security and stability, as well as a sense of belonging and continuity. This can be particularly important for children during times of stress or change, such as during a divorce or separation.

Furthermore, children with both a mother and a father are less likely to experience poverty and other negative outcomes, as both parents tend to be more economically stable, and they can also provide children with more opportunities and better life outcomes. For example, children from two-parent families tend to have better academic performance, greater emotional well-being, and fewer behavioral problems.

Moreover, having both a mother and a father present can also provide children with a sense of cultural and ethnic identity. Children with both a mother and a father have the opportunity to learn about and understand different cultural and ethnic backgrounds, which can be important for their sense of self-worth and belonging.

However, it's worth noting that not all families have a mother and a father. Single-parent households, same-sex parent households, and blended families are becoming increasingly common. And while these family structures may differ from the traditional two-parent household, they can still provide children with love, stability, and a positive upbringing. Additionally, many single parents, grandparents, foster and adoptive parents, and other caregivers can provide children with a positive and nurturing environment.

In conclusion, children need a mother and a father, as the two sexes provide different but complementary roles in the development and well-being of children. Having both parents present can provide children with a well-rounded and balanced upbringing, as well as a sense of security and stability. However, it's important to acknowledge that not all families have a mother and a father and that many different family structures can provide children with a positive and nurturing environment.",1
510,1121.a2.txt,Is homosexuality unnatural and unethical? (...and does it really matter?),"Homosexuality has been a topic of debate and controversy for many years. Some individuals argue that homosexuality is unnatural and unethical, while others argue that it is a natural and moral aspect of human diversity. In this essay, I will explore the question of whether or not homosexuality is unnatural and unethical, and whether it really matters.

First, it is important to understand that homosexuality is not a choice, but rather it is a natural aspect of human sexuality. Scientific research has shown that sexual orientation, including homosexuality, is determined by a combination of biological, psychological, and environmental factors. Therefore, it is not something that can be chosen or changed.

Furthermore, many experts in fields such as psychology, psychiatry, and biology have concluded that homosexuality is not a mental disorder or a moral failing, but rather a natural variation of human sexuality. Therefore, it is not unnatural or unethical.

Additionally, it is important to understand that sexual orientation is not something that can be changed, regardless of any attempts to do so. There is no scientific evidence that so-called ""conversion therapy"" can change an individual's sexual orientation. Moreover, this kind of therapy has been deemed harmful and unethical by many professional organizations.

Moreover, it is important to recognize that discrimination and prejudice against individuals based on their sexual orientation is unethical. All individuals should be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation. Moreover, denying rights and opportunities to individuals based on their sexual orientation is a violation of human rights.

Furthermore, it is important to remember that the question of whether or not homosexuality is unnatural or unethical is a matter of personal beliefs and perspective, and it is not a question that can be definitively answered by science or any other objective measure. People have different beliefs and values and that should be respected.

In conclusion, homosexuality is not unnatural or unethical, but rather a natural variation of human sexuality. Discrimination and prejudice against individuals based on their sexual orientation is harmful and unethical. The question of whether or not homosexuality is unnatural or unethical is a matter of personal beliefs and perspective and should be respected.",1
511,2000.a2.txt,NA,"Television has been a prominent medium of entertainment and information for decades. It has the power to shape public opinion, influence behavior, and impact the development of children and adults alike. In this essay, I will explore the influence of television on society, discussing the effects of television on children, the impact of television on politics and public opinion, and the effects of television on culture and behavior.

One of the most significant ways in which television has an impact on society is through its influence on children. Children are a particularly vulnerable audience, as they are still in the process of developing their cognitive, social, and emotional skills. Research has shown that excessive television viewing can have negative effects on children's development, including poor academic performance, behavioral problems, and obesity. Furthermore, the content of television programs can also have a negative impact on children, as they may be exposed to violence, sex, and other mature themes.

Television also has the power to shape public opinion and influence politics. Television news programs, in particular, have the ability to shape public opinion by highlighting certain issues, and providing a particular perspective on them. Additionally, television advertising has the power to shape consumer behavior, by creating a desire for certain products and services. Furthermore, television has been used as a tool in political campaigns, through which candidates can reach a large audience and present their message.

Another way in which television has an impact on society is through its influence on culture and behavior. Television programs and commercials can shape cultural norms and values by presenting a particular view of the world, and by depicting certain behaviors and lifestyles as desirable or undesirable. Furthermore, the way in which television depicts different groups of people can also shape cultural attitudes and stereotypes. Additionally, television can also have an impact on behavior, by shaping consumer behavior, as well as by providing a model for how people should behave in certain situations.

Despite the potential negative effects of television, it is also important to note that television can have positive effects on society as well. Television can be a powerful tool for education and information, providing access to news, current events, and cultural programming, that can help to broaden people's perspectives and understanding of the world. Additionally, television can provide entertainment and a sense of community, bringing people together to share in a common experience.

In conclusion, television has a significant influence on society. The effects of television on children, politics, public opinion, culture, and behavior are undeniable. However, it's also important to note that television can have positive effects as well. It's important to be aware of the potential negative effects and to use television in moderation and be mindful of the content that is being consumed. As with any other medium, it's essential to use it responsibly and critically.",1
512,2005.a2.txt,Animals do not need human intelligence!,"Animals are often thought of as inferior to humans due to their lack of intelligence and language abilities. However, this belief is not only misguided but also harmful as it disregards the unique abilities and intelligence of animals. In this essay, I will explore the idea that animals do not need human intelligence and why this belief is problematic.

First, it is important to recognize that animals possess their own unique forms of intelligence and abilities that are not comparable to human intelligence. For example, animals such as dolphins, elephants, and crows have been shown to possess advanced problem-solving and communication skills, as well as the ability to recognize themselves in a mirror, a sign of self-awareness. Additionally, many animals have remarkable physical abilities such as echolocation in bats, navigation skills in birds and homing ability in sea turtles. These abilities are highly specialized and adapted to their specific environments and survival needs.

Furthermore, the belief that animals need human intelligence is also problematic because it disregards the intelligence and abilities of animals and implies that animals are inferior to humans. This belief can lead to the exploitation and mistreatment of animals, as it suggests that animals are not capable of feeling pain, suffering, or having their own needs and desires. Additionally, this belief can also contribute to the degradation of natural habitats and the extinction of animal species, as it suggests that animals are not important or necessary for the balance of the ecosystem.

Moreover, this belief also ignores the fact that animals can communicate with each other in their own ways, and they can understand and respond to their environment, they have their own cultures, social structures, and behaviors that are specific to their species. These skills and abilities are developed and passed down through generations, showing that animals have a form of intelligence that is unique and different from human intelligence.

Additionally, it is important to remember that intelligence is not the only measure of an organism's worth or value. All living beings have the right to exist, and each species has its own unique role in the ecosystem. The intelligence of animals should not be used as a reason to exploit or disregard their existence.

In conclusion, animals do not need human intelligence to be valuable and important. The belief that animals are inferior to humans because they lack human intelligence is misguided and problematic. Animals possess their own unique forms of intelligence and abilities that are not comparable to human intelligence. This belief can lead to the exploitation and mistreatment of animals, as well as the degradation of natural habitats and the extinction of animal species. It's essential to recognize the unique abilities and intelligence of animals and to respect their existence and value in the ecosystem.",1
513,2007.a2.txt,Systembolaget open on Saturdays - something to worry about?,"Systembolaget is the state-owned monopoly of retail sales of alcoholic beverages in Sweden. One of the long-standing debates in Sweden is whether or not Systembolaget should be open on Saturdays, which is currently not the case. In this essay, I will explore the potential implications of Systembolaget being open on Saturdays, discussing the potential effects on public health and safety, the economy, and the role of Systembolaget in regulating alcohol consumption.

One of the main arguments against Systembolaget being open on Saturdays is that it could lead to an increase in alcohol-related harm and crime. There is evidence to suggest that increased availability of alcohol is associated with increased alcohol-related harm, such as increased rates of drunkenness, accidents, and crime. Furthermore, opening Systembolaget on Saturdays could lead to increased binge drinking and alcohol-related problems among young people, who may have more free time on weekends.

Additionally, opening Systembolaget on Saturdays could have a negative impact on the economy, as it could lead to a decrease in sales for other businesses, such as restaurants and bars, which rely on alcohol sales to drive their revenue. Furthermore, it could also lead to an increase in costs for law enforcement and healthcare, as a result of increased alcohol-related harm.

On the other hand, some argue that opening Systembolaget on Saturdays would increase convenience for customers and boost the economy. Systembolaget is currently closed on Saturdays, meaning that customers have to plan ahead and purchase their alcohol during the week or on Fridays, which can be inconvenient. Furthermore, It could also boost the economy as it could increase revenue for Systembolaget, as well as creating jobs.

Another important aspect to consider is the role of Systembolaget in regulating alcohol consumption. Systembolaget was created with the purpose of regulating alcohol consumption and reducing alcohol-",1
514,2009.a2.txt,Capital punishment in Sweden?,"Capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, is the legal process of putting a person to death as a punishment for a crime. In Sweden, capital punishment was abolished in 1910 and has been banned by the Swedish Constitution since 1974. However, the topic of capital punishment remains a controversial and debated topic in many countries, including Sweden. In this essay, I will explore the topic of capital punishment in Sweden, discussing the history of capital punishment in Sweden, the current laws and regulations, and the arguments for and against its reinstatement.

Historically, capital punishment was widely used in Sweden, with the death penalty being applied for a variety of crimes, including murder, treason, and robbery. However, as society progressed and developed a greater understanding of crime and punishment, the use of capital punishment began to decrease. In 1910, capital punishment was officially abolished for all crimes except for treason in times of war. The death penalty for treason was abolished in 1974 and capital punishment has been banned by the Swedish Constitution since then.

Currently, the Swedish legal system does not include the death penalty as a form of punishment. In fact, the Swedish government has ratified several international treaties that prohibit the use of capital punishment, such as the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Protocol No. 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights.

Despite the fact that capital punishment is banned in Sweden, some people argue in favor of its reinstatement. Supporters of capital punishment argue that it serves as a deterrent to crime and is an appropriate punishment for heinous crimes such as murder. They also argue that capital punishment provides closure for the victims' families and serves as justice for the victims.

On the other hand, opponents of capital punishment argue that it is inhumane and violates the right to life. They also argue that the death penalty does not effectively deter crime and that there is a risk of executing innocent people. Furthermore, opponents argue that capital punishment is costly and that the resources used to carry out the death penalty could be better used to support crime prevention and rehabilitation programs.

In addition to these arguments, there are also concerns about the potential for racial and socio-economic bias in the administration of capital punishment, as well as the potential for wrongful convictions and executions.

In conclusion, capital punishment is currently banned in Sweden and has been for several decades. The Swedish legal system does not include the death penalty as a form of punishment and the government has ratified several international treaties that prohibit the use of capital punishment. While some argue in favor of reinstating capital punishment, the arguments against it, such as its inhumane nature, the risk of executing innocent people, and the potential for racial and socio-economic bias, outweigh the arguments in favor of it. Therefore, it is important to maintain the ban on capital punishment in Sweden.",1
515,2011.a2.txt,Legislate against smoking - which is most important; the smoker's right to intoxicate or everybody else's right to breathe?,"Smoking is a controversial issue that has long been a topic of debate, particularly in relation to the right to smoke versus the right to a smoke-free environment. In this essay, I will explore the topic of legislating against smoking, discussing the arguments for and against smoking restrictions, and the impact of smoking on public health and the rights of non-smokers.

One of the main arguments in favor of legislating against smoking is the impact of smoking on public health. Smoking is a leading cause of preventable death and disease, including lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory illness. Second-hand smoke is also a significant health risk, exposing non-smokers to the harmful chemicals found in cigarette smoke. Therefore, legislating against smoking is seen as a way to protect public health and reduce the burden on the healthcare system.

Furthermore, many argue that legislating against smoking is necessary to protect the rights of non-smokers. Non-smokers have the right to breathe clean air and be protected from the harmful effects of second-hand smoke. Therefore, smoking restrictions, such as bans on smoking in public places, are seen as necessary to ensure that non-smokers are not exposed to the dangers of second-hand smoke.

On the other hand, some argue that legislating against smoking is a violation of the smoker's right to intoxicate. They argue that smoking is a personal choice and that individuals should have the right to make that choice, even if it is harmful to their health. Additionally, some argue that smoking restrictions can be seen as an infringement on personal freedom and individual rights.

However, it's important to note that smoking is not just a personal choice, but it also impacts the people around the smoker. Secondhand smoke harms not only the smoker but also the people around them, and it's not fair to expose other people to the harmful effects of smoke.

Moreover, it's important to note that society has a right to protect the health of its citizens, and the government has a responsibility to ensure that the citizens are protected from harmful actions, whether they are intentional or not. This can be seen in the example of legislating against other harmful actions such as drunk driving, it's not just a violation of personal freedom but it also poses a threat to the general public.

Furthermore, it's worth mentioning that smoking restrictions have been effective in reducing smoking rates and the number of smoking-related deaths. This can be seen in the example of countries such as Canada and Australia, that have implemented strict smoking restrictions and have seen a decline in smoking rates and smoking-related deaths.

In conclusion, legislating against smoking is necessary to protect public health and the rights of non-smokers. The right to breathe clean air and be protected from the harmful effects of second-hand smoke outweighs the smoker's right to intoxicate. It's essential for the government to take action to reduce smoking rates and the number of smoking-related deaths. The implementation of smoking restrictions and education campaigns are some of the ways to achieve this goal. Furthermore, it's important to note that smoking restrictions have been effective in reducing smoking rates and the number of smoking-related deaths in other countries.",1
516,2012.a2.txt,Why censorship in movies is a Bad Thing,"Censorship in movies refers to the process of examining and restricting certain content in films for various reasons, such as political, religious, or moral considerations. While censorship may be implemented with the intention of protecting certain groups or individuals, it can also have negative effects on society and the film industry. In this essay, I will explore the reasons why censorship in movies is a bad thing, discussing the impact on free speech, artistic expression, and the representation of diverse perspectives.

One of the main reasons why censorship in movies is a bad thing is that it limits free speech and artistic expression. The film industry is an important medium for expressing ideas and perspectives, and censorship can prevent important and controversial issues from being explored and discussed. Furthermore, censorship can also limit the creative choices of filmmakers, stifling their ability to tell the stories they want to tell.

Moreover, censorship in movies can also have a negative impact on the representation of diverse perspectives. Films are a powerful medium for telling stories and reflecting the experiences of different cultures, ethnicities, and communities. Censorship can prevent these stories from being told, limiting the representation of diverse perspectives and perpetuating societal inequalities.

Furthermore, censorship can also be used as a tool of oppression, particularly in countries where the government controls the film industry. In these cases, censorship can be used to silence dissenting voices and maintain the status quo. It can also be used to promote a particular ideology or agenda, rather than protecting the public.

Another issue with censorship in movies is that it can be arbitrary and inconsistent. Different countries and regions have different censorship laws, and what may be considered offensive or inappropriate in one place may not be in another. Additionally, the censorship standards can change over time, meaning that films that were once considered acceptable may now be considered inappropriate. This can lead to confusion and frustration for filmmakers and audiences alike.

In addition, censorship in movies can also lead to the creation of a black market, as people seek out uncensored versions of films. This can be particularly dangerous when it comes to films that have been censored for political or ideological reasons, as it may lead to the spread of harmful or dangerous ideas.",1
517,2013.a2.txt,Shorter Hours: Just a Matter of Time,"The concept of shorter working hours has been a topic of discussion for many years, with some arguing that it could have significant benefits for both individuals and society as a whole. In this essay, I will explore the idea of shorter working hours and discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks, as well as the feasibility of implementing such a change.

One of the main arguments in favor of shorter working hours is that it could lead to improved work-life balance. Long working hours can lead to stress, fatigue, and burnout, which can negatively impact an individual's physical and mental health. Shorter working hours could allow individuals to spend more time with their families, pursue hobbies, and engage in leisure activities, leading to a happier and healthier population.

Furthermore, shorter working hours could also have a positive impact on the economy. With more free time, individuals would be able to consume more goods and services, leading to increased economic activity. Additionally, shorter working hours could also lead to a decrease in absenteeism and an increase in productivity, as individuals would be better able to manage their time and energy.

Another argument in favor of shorter working hours is that it could lead to a more equitable distribution of wealth. Long working hours can lead to income inequality, as those who work longer hours tend to earn more than those who work fewer hours. Shorter working hours could lead to a more equal distribution of work, allowing more individuals to share in the benefits of economic growth.

On the other hand, some argue that shorter working hours would lead to increased costs for businesses and could negatively impact the economy. Businesses would need to hire more employees to cover the same amount of work, leading to increased labor costs. Additionally, shorter working hours could lead to a decrease in productivity, as individuals may not be as focused and motivated when working shorter hours.

Moreover, it's worth mentioning that shorter working hours may not be feasible for some industries, such as healthcare, emergency services, and some manufacturing jobs. It's essential to consider the practicality of implementing shorter working hours in these industries, and how it would impact the availability of these essential services.

In conclusion, shorter working hours could have significant benefits for individuals and society as a whole, including improved work-life balance, increased economic activity, and a more equitable distribution of wealth. However, it's important to consider the potential drawbacks and feasibility of implementing shorter working hours, particularly in certain industries. It's also crucial to think about how shorter working hours would be implemented and how it would be financed. It could be through reducing the number of public holidays, increasing the working days,",1

Additionally, animal research is also crucial in understanding the basic biology of animals, which can help in the conservation of endangered species and the management of wildlife populations.

On the other hand, some argue that the use of laboratory animals is cruel and unethical. Animals used in research may be subjected to harmful procedures, such as surgery, deprivation, and exposure to toxic substances. Additionally, many animals used in research are kept in confined spaces and may not be able to engage in natural behaviors. Furthermore, some argue that animal research is not always necessary and that there are alternatives, such as cell culture and computer modeling, that can be used to achieve the same goals.

Furthermore, it's worth mentioning that there are ethical considerations when it comes to animal research. The use of animals in research raises questions about the moral status of animals and their capacity to feel pain and suffer. Additionally, there are concerns about the welfare of animals used in research, and whether or not their suffering is justified by the potential benefits to humans.

In this essay, I will explore the topic of belief in God, discussing some of the reasons why people might choose to believe in a higher power, as well as some of the potential benefits and drawbacks of such a belief.

One of the most common reasons why people might choose to believe in God is for a sense of purpose and meaning. Many individuals find that belief in a higher power gives them a sense of direction and purpose in life, providing them with a framework for understanding their place in the world.

On the other hand, some argue that belief in God is not necessary and can lead to negative consequences. Some argue that belief in God can lead to a lack of critical thinking and a reliance on faith rather than reason. Additionally, belief in God can also lead to divisive and harmful ideologies, such as religious extremism. Furthermore, belief in God can also lead to a lack of personal responsibility, as individuals may attribute their successes and failures to the will of a higher power.

Furthermore, it's worth noting that belief in God is not a requirement for a fulfilling and meaningful life. Many individuals who do not believe in God still find purpose and meaning in their lives through other means, such as family, work, and community service. Additionally, many individuals who do not believe in God still have a sense of morality, and ethical principles that guide their actions.

In conclusion, belief in God is a deeply personal and complex topic with a wide range of reasons for why people might choose to believe.

In this essay, I will explore the topic of the objectification of women, discussing the reasons why women are often objectified and the impact this has on society. Additionally, I will discuss the role of culture and media in perpetuating the objectification of women and the importance of challenging and changing these harmful attitudes and representations.

One of the main reasons why women are often objectified is the societal belief that their worth is based on their physical appearance and sexual attractiveness. This belief is reinforced by the media, which often portrays women as objects to be looked at and desired, rather than as individuals with their own thoughts, feelings, and ambitions. This objectification of women is particularly prevalent in advertising, where women are often portrayed in sexually suggestive poses and used to sell products.

Additionally, objectifying women reinforces harmful gender stereotypes and reinforces the idea that men are superior to women. The objectification of women also perpetuates the idea that women are less capable than men, which can lead to discrimination and bias in the workplace, education, and other areas of life. Furthermore, objectifying women can also lead to violence against women, as it can be seen as a justification for treating them as less than human.

Moreover, it's worth noting that the objectification of women is not limited to any one culture or society, it's a global phenomenon. The media, advertising, and entertainment industries are all guilty of perpetuating harmful stereotypes and objectifying women. Thus, it's crucial to be aware of how these representations influence our attitudes and actions, and to actively challenge and change them.

Tear gas, also known as CS gas, is a chemical agent that causes irritation to the eyes, nose, throat, and lungs, and is commonly used by law enforcement as a form of crowd control. In this essay, I will explore the topic of the right to bear tear gas, discussing the arguments for and against its use, as well as the potential impact it may have on society.

One of the main arguments for the use of tear gas is that it is a non-lethal form of crowd control that can be used to disperse large crowds and maintain public safety. When used in accordance with established protocols, tear gas can be an effective means of controlling unruly or violent crowds without causing serious injury or death. Additionally, tear gas can be used to protect police officers and other first responders from harm, by giving them the means to defend themselves and maintain control of a situation.

On the other hand, some argue that the use of tear gas is excessive and can lead to unnecessary harm and injury. Tear gas can cause serious respiratory problems, particularly for individuals with pre-existing conditions. Additionally, tear gas can also cause blindness and other long-term health problems, particularly if it's used in enclosed spaces or in large amounts.

In this essay, I will explore the topic of respect, discussing its definition, importance, and how it is viewed in today's society. I will also examine the ways in which respect is demonstrated, and how it can be taught and nurtured.

Respect is defined as the act of showing consideration or admiration for someone or something. It is a multifaceted concept that encompasses various aspects of human behavior, including politeness, manners, and consideration for others. Respect is a fundamental principle that underpins all human interactions and relationships, whether it be between individuals, groups, or nations.

One of the most important reasons for why respect is crucial is that it promotes trust and understanding among individuals and groups. Respectful behavior helps to build trust and understanding by fostering an environment of mutual consideration, empathy, and open communication. It also allows for the resolution of conflicts and the creation of positive relationships and communities.

Furthermore, respect is considered old-fashioned in the sense that it is a fundamental principle that has been passed down through generations. Respectful behavior is often taught at a young age by parents and caregivers, and is reinforced by societal norms and expectations. It is often viewed as a traditional value that is essential for maintaining a stable and harmonious society.

On the other hand, respect is also seen as common sense because it is something that is intuitive and innate in all humans. It is something that is not only taught but also learned through observation and experience. People understand that mutual respect is needed for peaceful and cooperative interactions and relationships.

Moreover, respect is demonstrated through actions, words, and attitude. It can be shown through simple gestures such as holding the door open for someone, or through more significant actions such as listening attentively to others and treating them with dignity and fairness. Additionally, respect can also be demonstrated through how we speak to others and how we treat their personal belongings and property.

524,2020.a2.txt,A nuclear phase-out is not of immediate,"A nuclear phase-out, or the process of shutting down and decommissioning nuclear power plants, is a complex and controversial issue that has been the subject of much debate in recent years. While some argue that a nuclear phase-out is necessary for the safety and well-being of society, others argue that it is not of immediate concern and that nuclear power is still a viable source of energy. In this essay, I will explore the topic of a nuclear phase-out, discussing the arguments for and against it, as well as the potential impact it may have on society.

One of the main arguments for a nuclear phase-out is that it is necessary for the safety and well-being of society. Nuclear power plants have the potential to cause severe accidents, such as meltdowns or leaks, which can release radioactive materials into the environment and cause harm to human health and the environment. Additionally, nuclear power plants also generate radioactive waste, which can remain dangerous for thousands of years and poses a significant disposal challenge.

Another argument for a nuclear phase-out is that it would reduce dependence on non-renewable energy sources and promote the use of clean, renewable energy. Nuclear power is considered a non-renewable energy source and phasing it out would allow for the increased use of clean, renewable energy such as wind and solar power. This would help to mitigate the effects of climate change and reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions.

On the other hand, some argue that a nuclear phase-out is not of immediate concern and that nuclear power is still a viable source of energy.

Additionally, nuclear power is considered an important tool in the fight against climate change, as it can reduce the amount of carbon emissions and help to mitigate the effects of climate change.

Furthermore, a nuclear phase-out would have significant economic and social impacts. The shutting down of nuclear power plants would lead to the loss of jobs and income for the communities that rely on them. Additionally, a nuclear phase-out would also lead to an increased reliance on fossil fuels and could make it more difficult to reach climate change goals.

Moreover, it's important to consider that a nuclear phase-out is a complex",1
525,2021.a2.txt,"Young, beautiful and successful: The superficial portrayal of women in the media","The portrayal of women in the media has long been a subject of concern, with many arguing that women are often portrayed in a superficial and unrealistic manner. This can be particularly damaging for young women, who are exposed to these images on a daily basis and may feel pressure to conform to these unrealistic standards. In this essay, I will explore the topic of the superficial portrayal of women in the media, discussing the reasons why women are often portrayed in this manner and the impact it has on society.

One of the main reasons why women are often portrayed in a superficial and unrealistic manner is that the media is dominated by patriarchal values and ideals. These values and ideals often prioritize physical beauty and youth above other qualities, such as intelligence, talent, and ambition. This leads to the portrayal of women as objects to be looked at and desired, rather than as individuals with their own thoughts, feelings, and ambitions.

Additionally, the media's portrayal of women as young and beautiful is also linked to the advertising industry, which often uses women's bodies to sell products. This can lead to the objectification of women and reinforces the idea that their worth is based on their physical appearance. Moreover, this portrayal is also linked to the unrealistic beauty standards that are imposed on women, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem among young women.

Furthermore, the superficial portrayal of women in the media can also have a negative impact on society as a whole. It can lead to the reinforcement of harmful gender stereotypes and reinforces the idea that women's worth is based on their physical appearance. This can lead to discrimination and bias in the workplace, education, and other areas of life. Additionally, it can also lead to the objectification and sexualization of women, which can contribute to the normalization of harassment and violence against women.

Moreover, the portrayal of women as young and beautiful also perpetuates the idea that women's value and beauty are fleeting and that they must work to maintain their youth and beauty. This can lead to increased pressure on women to conform to unrealistic beauty standards, which can be damaging to their physical and mental health.

It's worth noting that the media is not solely responsible for the superficial portrayal of women, but it is a significant player in shaping societal attitudes and beliefs. Thus, it's crucial for media outlets, advertisers and creators to take responsibility for their representation of women and take steps to create more realistic and diverse representation of women in the media.

Doesn't it just cost a lot of money?,"The monarchy in Sweden has been a topic of debate for many years, with some arguing that it is a necessary institution that represents the country's history and culture, while others argue that it is costly and outdated. In this essay, I will explore the topic of the monarchy in Sweden, discussing its origins, functions, and costs, as well as the arguments for and against its existence.

The monarchy in Sweden has its origins in the Middle Ages and has been in existence for over a thousand years. Historically, the monarchy played an important role in the country's political and social development, serving as a symbol of unity and continuity. The Swedish monarchy has also played an important role in the country's foreign relations and diplomacy, representing the country in international events and promoting cultural and economic ties.

Currently, the Swedish monarchy is a constitutional monarchy, which means that the monarch serves as a ceremonial head of state, while the real power is held by the government and the parliament. The monarch has no political power and serves mostly ceremonial functions, such as receiving foreign dignitaries, opening parliament, and performing other ceremonial duties.

One of the main arguments against the monarchy in Sweden is that it is costly to maintain. The Swedish monarchy is funded by the government, and the costs of maintaining the royal palace, the palace staff, and the security of the royal family are paid for by taxpayers. Additionally, the monarchy also incurs costs for travel, events, and other expenses.

However, supporters of the monarchy argue that the costs are relatively small compared to the benefits that the monarchy provides. The monarchy is seen as an important symbol of national identity and continuity, and it serves as a focus for national pride and unity. Additionally, the monarchy also plays an important role in promoting tourism and economic activity in the country.

Moreover, supporters of the monarchy argue that it serves as a unifying force in society, bringing people together for events such as royal weddings, coronations, and other ceremonies. The monarchy also plays an important role in supporting charities, cultural institutions, and other organizations, and in promoting the arts and sciences.

Furthermore, the monarchy has a symbolic role and it represents the continuity of the country's history and culture, and it’s a representation of the country's national heritage. Additionally, it can be argued that the monarchy is a source of inspiration and a source of national pride, which can have a positive impact on national morale and sense of community.

In conclusion, the monarchy in Sweden has a long history and serves both ceremonial and symbolic functions. It is a representation of the country's history and culture, and it serves as an important symbol of national identity and continuity. While the monarchy does have costs, it also provides benefits such",1
527,2023.a2.txt,"Many argue that the Conservative and Social Democratic parties should have had built a coalition in order to block the AFP from entering the government, but I think that's not the way to act in a democracy. I see the AFP as the Austrian people's revolt against old parties that have had the power for the last fifty years and in a democracy it is very important to respect election results and in the latest election the biggest winner was actually the AFP and ignoring this expression of discontent would have made, I think, the AFP even more popular and would've enabled them to continue their policy of populist soundbacks, while in government they have to take more responsibility for their comments because the party now represents Austria. Another thing is that it is easier for the other parties to counter the AFP when it has power and a position to think about, but it also gives the AFP a chance to show what they stand for and after this, are Europeans but especially Austrians entitled to draw conclusion of the AFP and not before the AFP got in power, a mistake that the EU made. It made it maybe because it's afraid that the same kind of development is also possible in other European countries.","The Australian Freedom Party is a political party that was founded in 2011 in Australia. It is a right-wing populist party that focuses on issues such as immigration, economic freedom, and national sovereignty. The party has been the subject of much debate and criticism, with some arguing that it promotes xenophobia and racism, while others argue that it represents the views of a significant portion of the population. In this essay, I will explore the topic of the Australian Freedom Party, discussing its origins, platform, and impact on Australian politics.

The Australian Freedom Party was founded in 2011 by a group of individuals who were dissatisfied with the major political parties and felt that their views were not being represented. The party's platform focuses on issues such as immigration, economic freedom, and national sovereignty. The party is particularly critical of what it views as the negative impacts of mass immigration and multiculturalism on Australian society. They also advocate for reducing government intervention and regulation in the economy and promoting individual freedoms.

One of the main criticisms of the Australian Freedom Party is that it promotes xenophobia and racism. The party's focus on immigration and national sovereignty has been criticized as a thinly veiled attack on immigrants and minorities. Additionally, some of the party's leaders and members have been accused of making racist and discriminatory statements.

However, supporters of the party argue that it is not racist or xenophobic and that it represents the views of a significant portion of the population. They argue that the party's focus on immigration and national sovereignty is not motivated by racism or xenophobia but rather by a desire to preserve Australian culture and protect the country's national interest.

Moreover, the Australian Freedom Party has had a limited impact on Australian politics. The party has not been successful in winning any seats in parliament, and it has not been able to gain significant support among voters. Additionally, the party has been criticized for its lack of clear policy proposals and for its lack of experienced political leaders.

Furthermore, it has been argued that the Australian Freedom Party's views are not in line with the values of a majority of the Australian society, which values diversity and inclusivity. Additionally, their views on immigration and multiculturalism can be seen as divisive and counter-productive, as Australia is a nation of immigrants and it's important to embrace and celebrate diversity as a nation.

The party's platform focuses on issues such as immigration, economic freedom, and national sovereignty. However, the party has been criticized for promoting xenophobia and racism, and has had a limited impact on Australian politics.

In this essay, I will explore the topic of immigration in Sweden, discussing the reasons why immigrants are a valuable resource in Swedish society, as well as the challenges that they face and the benefits that they bring.

One of the main reasons why immigrants are a valuable resource in Swedish society is that they bring diversity and cultural richness to the country. Immigrants bring with them different languages, customs, and traditions, which can enrich the cultural fabric of the country. Additionally, immigrants bring new perspectives and ideas, which can lead to innovation and progress in various fields.

Another reason why immigrants are a valuable resource in Swedish society is that they contribute to the country's economy. Immigrants are often highly motivated and hardworking, and they can fill labor shortages in various sectors. Additionally, immigrants also start their own businesses, which can lead to economic growth and job creation.

Moreover, immigrants bring with them a wealth of skills, knowledge and qualifications that can be beneficial to the country. This can be especially true for highly skilled immigrants, who can contribute to the country's knowledge-based economy by working in fields such as research, technology, and medicine.

Additionally, immigrants can also bring a valuable diversity of perspectives and experiences to Swedish society, which can lead to increased understanding and empathy towards different cultures and backgrounds. This can help to create a more inclusive and tolerant society for everyone.

However, it's worth noting that immigrants in Sweden also face many challenges. They may have difficulty finding housing and employment, and they may also face discrimination and prejudice. Additionally, immigrants may also struggle to learn the language and integrate into Swedish society.

It's important for the Swedish society to address these challenges and provide support and resources to help immigrants integrate and succeed. This can include language classes, job training, and other programs to help immigrants succeed. Additionally, it's also important to work towards creating a more inclusive and tolerant society, where immigrants are welcomed and valued for their contributions.

529,2026.a2.txt,A NEVER CEASING DEBATE,"The topic of debate is one that has been around for centuries, and it is a subject that is never-ending. Debate is a way for individuals to express their opinions and ideas, and it allows for the exchange of different perspectives and ideas. Debate can take many forms, from formal debates in political and legal settings to informal discussions in everyday life. In this essay, I will explore the topic of debate, discussing its origins, forms, and importance in society.

Debate has its origins in ancient Greece, where it was a central part of the educational system. The Greeks believed that debate was an essential tool for developing critical thinking and reasoning skills, and it was used to train students in public speaking and argumentation.

Debate can take many forms, from formal debates in political and legal settings, to informal discussions in everyday life. Formal debates often take place in political or legal settings, where individuals or teams argue for or against a specific proposal or policy. Informal debates can take place in everyday settings, such as in the workplace, school, or among friends and family.

Debate is an important tool for democracy and decision-making. It allows for the exchange of different perspectives and ideas, and it allows individuals to express their opinions and ideas. Debate can also be a way for individuals to test their own beliefs and assumptions, and it can help to build mutual understanding and respect.

Moreover, debate is also a way for individuals to develop critical thinking and reasoning skills. It allows individuals to evaluate and analyze different arguments and evidence, and it helps individuals to form their own opinions and ideas. Additionally, debate also helps individuals to develop public speaking and argumentation skills, which can be useful in various settings.

Furthermore, debate can also be a way to promote social change and progress.

Additionally, debate can also be a way to challenge existing power structures and to hold those in power accountable.

However, it's worth noting that debate can also be divisive, and it can lead to conflict and tension. Additionally, debate can also be used to silence marginalized voices and to maintain the status quo. It's important to recognize that debate should be inclusive and respectful, and it should be used as a tool to build mutual understanding and progress.

530,2027.a2.txt,Monarchy demoralises everywhere it exists,"The institution of monarchy has been a part of human history for centuries, with many countries still having a monarchy as their head of state. However, there are arguments that the existence of a monarchy demoralizes the society where it exists. In this essay, I will explore the topic of monarchy and how it is said to demoralize society.

One of the main arguments against monarchy is that it is an outdated and unnecessary institution that is no longer relevant in modern society. A monarchy is often seen as a symbol of the past, and it is argued that it is not in line with the principles of democracy and equality. Additionally, the existence of a monarchy is said to perpetuate a class system, where the royal family is seen as above the common people, creating a sense of inferiority among citizens.

Another argument is that the existence of a monarchy perpetuates the idea of the divine right of kings, which is the belief that monarchs are appointed by God and are therefore above the laws and morals of society. This belief is said to have a negative impact on the moral fabric of society, as it can lead to a lack of accountability and responsibility among those in power.

Furthermore, the existence of a monarchy can also have a negative impact on the economy. Monarchies are often expensive to maintain, and the money spent on the royal family and their lifestyle could be used for more important and pressing issues. The cost of maintaining a monarchy is said to take away resources from important public services and infrastructure, which can have a detrimental effect on society.

Moreover, the existence of a monarchy is said to have a negative impact on civic education and civic engagement. When citizens are taught that their country is ruled by a royal family, they may be less likely to engage in the democratic process and may feel that their opinions and voices don’t matter. Additionally, the focus on the royal family can divert attention from important political and social issues, which can lead to a lack of civic engagement and knowledge.

In conclusion, the institution of monarchy is said to demoralize society where it exists. It is seen as an outdated and unnecessary institution that is no longer relevant in modern society. Additionally, the existence of a monarchy is said to perpetuate a class system, perpetuate the idea of the divine right of kings, have a negative impact on the economy, and have a negative impact on civic education and civic engagement. The argument is that the society will be better off without a monarchy and it will be more democratic and equal.",1
531,2030.a2.txt,HUMANITY BY LAW IN SWEDEN?,"Humanity by law is the idea that the legal system should be based on the principles of human rights and dignity. In Sweden, this principle is reflected in the country's laws and legal system, which are designed to protect the rights and dignity of all individuals. However, there are some who argue that the legal system in Sweden does not always live up to this principle. In this essay, I will explore the topic of humanity by law in Sweden, discussing the ways in which the legal system is designed to protect the rights and dignity of all individuals, as well as the ways in which it falls short.

One of the ways in which the legal system in Sweden is designed to protect the rights and dignity of all individuals is through the principle of equality before the law. This principle is reflected in the Swedish Constitution, which states that all individuals are equal before the law and that no one shall be discriminated against on the basis of their gender, ethnic origin, religion, or other grounds. Additionally, the Swedish legal system also includes a number of laws and regulations that are designed to protect the rights of marginalized groups, such as women and minorities.

Another way in which the legal system in Sweden is designed to protect the rights and dignity of all individuals is through the principle of due process. This principle is reflected in the Swedish legal system, which ensures that all individuals have the right to a fair trial, the right to legal representation, and the right to appeal a decision. Additionally, the Swedish legal system also includes a number of laws and regulations that are designed to protect the rights of individuals who are in vulnerable situations, such as children and the elderly.

However, there are some who argue that the legal system in Sweden does not always live up to the principle of humanity by law. One of the main criticisms is that the legal system can be slow and inefficient, which can lead to lengthy and costly legal proceedings. Additionally, some argue that the legal system can be complex and difficult to navigate, which can make it difficult for individuals to access justice. Furthermore, there are criticisms that the legal system in Sweden is not always able to effectively protect the rights of marginalized groups, such as immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers, and they may face discrimination and mistreatment.

Moreover, there are also criticisms that the legal system in Sweden is not always able to effectively protect the rights of individuals who are in vulnerable situations, such as children and the elderly. This is due to the lack of specialized laws and regulations that are designed to protect these groups, as well as a lack of resources to enforce these laws. Additionally, there is a lack of education and awareness about the rights of these groups among legal professionals, which can lead to a lack of understanding",1
532,2031.a2.txt,FAMILY TIES: CHILDREN'S RIGHT TO LIVE IN GAY FAMILIES,"Family ties are an important aspect of human life, and they play a crucial role in shaping the development and well-being of children. The traditional nuclear family, composed of a mother, father, and children, has long been considered the norm in many societies. However, in recent years, there has been a growing acceptance of alternative family structures, such as gay families. In this essay, I will explore the topic of family ties and children's right to live in gay families, discussing the benefits and challenges of gay parenting, as well as the legal and societal issues surrounding the topic.

One of the main benefits of gay parenting is that it provides children with a loving and stable home environment. Studies have shown that children raised by gay parents fare just as well as those raised by straight parents in terms of their emotional, social, and psychological well-being. Additionally, gay parents are often highly motivated and committed to parenting, and they are able to provide children with a nurturing and supportive home environment.

Another benefit of gay parenting is that it provides children with a diverse range of role models and perspectives. Children raised by gay parents are exposed to a wider range of gender roles and sexual orientations, which can help to foster acceptance and tolerance of diversity in society. Additionally, children raised by gay parents are often more open-minded and accepting of different lifestyles and family structures.

However, there are also challenges associated with gay parenting. One of the main challenges is the societal stigma and discrimination that gay parents and their children may face. Gay parents may face discrimination in the workplace, and their children may face bullying and discrimination at school. Additionally, there are also legal challenges associated with gay parenting, as many countries do not have laws that recognize and protect the rights of gay parents.

Moreover, there are also legal challenges associated with adoption, surrogacy, and assisted reproduction for gay couples. In many countries, laws are not clear or they are discriminatory and don't allow gay couples to adopt or have children through assisted reproduction. This can lead to difficulties and stress for the couple in their desire to have a child and form a family.

In conclusion, family ties are an important aspect of human life, and they play a crucial role in shaping the development and well-being of children. Gay families are becoming more accepted in society, and research has shown that children raised by gay parents fare just as well as those raised by straight parents. However, there are still challenges associated with gay parenting, including societal stigma and discrimination, as well as legal challenges.

533,2032.a2.txt,"The unemployment benefit system can't be particularly good when it makes work uneconomic. If you are offered equal or even better pay without working than if you were working who would not accept it and be grateful? The system should encourage people to find a new job and go back out to work, but that is not the case and the system is impudently misused. There are rules to limit this misuse, for example you have to look for a job all the time in order to be entitled to the benefit. Even so, that rule does not seem to work too good. People have to apply for jobs and they have to go to job interviews, but it is easy for them to make themselves not suited for the jobs if they want to by just giving an unsuitable image to employers. To require these people to do unpaid work in the public sector, to demand them to earn their benefit, would encourage them to seek and also to receive proper employment.","Unemployment is a significant problem that affects many individuals and families around the world. The loss of a job can have a significant impact on an individual's financial stability, mental health, and overall well-being. However, some unemployed people may choose to do non-paid jobs, also known as volunteer work or internships, as a way to gain experience and improve their chances of finding a paid job in the future. In this essay, I will explore the topic of unemployed people doing non-paid jobs, discussing the benefits and challenges of this choice.

One of the main benefits of unemployed people doing non-paid jobs is that it allows them to gain valuable experience and skills in a specific field. Many non-paid jobs, such as internships or volunteer work, offer training and hands-on experience that can be valuable for an individual's future job prospects. Additionally, non-paid jobs can also serve as a stepping stone to paid employment, as they can provide a way for individuals to network and make connections in their desired field.

Another benefit of non-paid jobs is that they can provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment for unemployed individuals. Being unemployed can be emotionally taxing, and it can lead to feelings of hopelessness and isolation. Non-paid jobs can provide a sense of purpose and give individuals a sense of accomplishment, which can improve their mental health and overall well-being.

However, there are also challenges associated with unemployed people doing non-paid jobs. One of the main challenges is that non-paid jobs do not provide a source of income for individuals and their families. This can lead to financial stress and instability, which can be detrimental to an individual's well-being. Additionally, non-paid jobs may not provide the same level of job security and benefits as paid employment.

Furthermore, there is a risk of exploitation, as some employers may take advantage of the vulnerability of unemployed people and offer non-paid jobs instead of paid employment. This can lead to individuals working long hours without receiving any compensation, which can be unfair and unjust. Additionally, non-paid jobs may not be regulated by labor laws and they may not be protected by labor rights.

In conclusion, unemployed people doing non-paid jobs can be beneficial in gaining valuable experience and skills, as well as providing a sense of purpose and fulfillment. However, it's important to recognize that non-paid jobs do not provide a source of income and they may not provide the",1
534,2034.a2.txt,Public health in danger - please don't reduce our PE lessons!,"Physical education (PE) is an important part of a child's education, not just for the development of their physical abilities but also for their overall health and well-being. However, in recent years, there have been calls to reduce or even eliminate PE lessons in schools, due to budget constraints and an emphasis on academic subjects. In this essay, I will explore the topic of reducing PE lessons and the impact it can have on public health.

One of the main concerns with reducing PE lessons is the impact it can have on a child's physical health. Regular physical activity is essential for the development of a child's motor skills, strength, and cardiovascular health. The World Health Organization recommends that children and adolescents should engage in at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity every day. Without regular PE lessons, it can be difficult for children to meet this recommendation, which can lead to a higher risk of obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases.

Another concern is the impact that reducing PE lessons can have on a child's mental health. Physical activity has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression and improving self-esteem and cognitive function. Additionally, PE lessons can provide a much-needed break from the academic subjects, allowing children to recharge and refocus.

Furthermore, PE classes are a great opportunity for children to learn teamwork, communication, and leadership skills. These skills are not only important for physical activities, but they are also essential for other aspects of life, such as personal and professional relationships. PE class provides a safe and enjoyable environment for children to learn these skills through activities and games.

Moreover, reducing PE classes can have an impact on the academic performance of students, as physical activities have been shown to improve focus and concentration, which can help with learning. Additionally, regular physical activity can improve sleep patterns, which can lead to better academic performance.

In conclusion, reducing PE classes can have a significant impact on public health. Regular physical activity is essential for the development of a child's motor skills, strength, cardiovascular health, mental health, and academic performance. Furthermore, PE classes provide an opportunity for children to learn teamwork, communication, and leadership skills. It's important to recognize the importance of PE classes and not to reduce them. Instead, efforts should be made to improve the quality of PE classes and make them more engaging, fun, and inclusive for all students.",1

Why keep capital tied-up in huge palaces when they could be sold and bring money to the state?

The concept of democracy has evolved over time, with the modern form of democracy being a relatively recent development. In this essay, I will explore the topic of modern democracy, discussing its evolution, principles, and challenges.

The evolution of democracy can be traced back to ancient Greece, where the concept of democracy first emerged in the city-state of Athens. In Athens, citizens were able to participate in the decision-making process through a system of direct democracy, in which citizens gathered in the assembly and made decisions by voting. However, this system was limited to a small group of citizens and excluded women, slaves, and foreigners.

The modern form of democracy emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries, with the rise of liberal democracy. Liberal democracy is characterized by the principle of representative democracy, in which citizens elect representatives to make decisions on their behalf. Additionally, liberal democracy also includes the principles of individual rights and freedoms, such as freedom of speech and the press, as well as the rule of law and an independent judiciary.

One of the main principles of modern democracy is the principle of political equality, which means that all citizens have an equal right to participate in the political process. This principle is reflected in the right to vote, as well as the right to stand for office. Additionally, modern democracy also includes the principle of accountability, which means that elected representatives are accountable to the citizens who elected them.

Another principle of modern democracy is the principle of popular sovereignty, which means that the power of the state comes from the people. This principle is reflected in the idea that government is based on the consent of the governed, and that citizens have the right to change or remove their government through peaceful means.

However, there are also challenges associated with modern democracy. One of the main challenges is the issue of political polarization, which can lead to a lack of cooperation and compromise in the political process. Additionally, there are also concerns about the influence of money in politics, as well as the impact of social media and fake news on the political process. Furthermore, there is a lack of representation and participation among marginalized groups, such as women, minorities, and low-income citizens.

Moreover, there are also challenges to the principle of accountability, as it's hard for citizens to hold their representatives accountable, especially if the representatives are not responsive to the citizens' needs and concerns. Additionally, there are concerns about the independence of the judiciary and the media, which are essential for the functioning of a democratic system.

In conclusion, modern democracy is a political system in which citizens have the right to participate in the decision-",1
536,2036.a2.txt,Compulsory work; solution for unemployed,"Unemployment is a significant problem that affects many individuals and families around the world. The loss of a job can have a significant impact on an individual's financial stability, mental health, and overall well-being. In an effort to address this problem, some have proposed the idea of compulsory work as a solution for the unemployed. In this essay, I will explore the topic of compulsory work, discussing its potential benefits and challenges.

One of the main benefits of compulsory work is that it can provide unemployed individuals with a source of income and financial stability. Compulsory work programs would require individuals to work in exchange for a salary or stipend, which can help to reduce poverty and financial insecurity. Additionally, compulsory work programs can also provide individuals with a sense of purpose and fulfillment, which can improve their mental health and overall well-being.

Another benefit of compulsory work is that it can help to address labor shortages in certain sectors. Compulsory work programs can provide a source of labor for industries that are facing a shortage of workers, such as agriculture, construction, and healthcare. Additionally, compulsory work programs can also help to address the problem of underemployment, as they can provide individuals with the opportunity to gain skills and experience in a specific field.

However, there are also challenges associated with compulsory work. One of the main challenges is that it can be difficult to ensure that individuals are placed in jobs that are appropriate for their skills and qualifications. Additionally, there is a risk that compulsory work programs could be used as a way to exploit and underpay workers, especially if they are not protected by labor laws and regulations.

Another challenge is that it could be seen as a violation of the individual's rights to work and to choose the kind of work they want to do. Compulsory work could lead to resentment and dissatisfaction among individuals, who may feel that they are being forced to work in a job they do not want to do. Furthermore, it could lead to a decrease in productivity and motivation, as individuals may feel demotivated and demotivated to work if they are not interested in the work they are doing.

Furthermore, compulsory work programs can be expensive to implement and administer, especially if they are not properly designed and managed. Additionally, there is a risk that compulsory work programs could be used as a way to replace paid employment with unpaid labor, which can be unfair and unjust.

In conclusion, compulsory work can be seen as a potential solution for unemployment, as it can provide unemployed individuals with a source of income and financial stability. However, it's",1
537,2038.a2.txt,"THE FAMILY, NOT THE STATE, SHOULD DECIDE WHAT SCHOOL AND CHILD CARE THEIR CHILDREN ATTEND!","The education and care of children is a crucial aspect of child development and society as a whole. It is the responsibility of parents and families to ensure that their children receive the best education and care possible. However, in some cases, the state may take a more active role in deciding what school and child care children attend. In this essay, I will argue that the family, not the state, should be the primary decision-maker when it comes to the education and care of children.

The first reason why the family should be the primary decision-maker is that parents are the ones who know their children best. They understand their children's unique needs, strengths, and weaknesses and can make informed decisions about what type of education and care is best for them. Parents are also the ones who are most invested in their children's future, and they are more likely to make decisions that are in their children's best interests.

Additionally, allowing families to choose their children's education and care options provides them with more flexibility and autonomy. This allows families to make decisions that align with their values and beliefs, rather than being forced to conform to a one-size-fits-all approach.

Furthermore, when families are able to choose their children's education and care options, they are more likely to be satisfied with the services provided. This is because they have more control over the decision-making process and are able to select options that align with their needs and preferences. This can lead to better outcomes for children and families, as they are more likely to be engaged and invested in the education and care they receive.

However, it's important to note that the state still plays an important role in ensuring that education and care options meet certain standards of quality and safety. The state can establish regulations and guidelines for schools and child care centers to ensure that children are receiving a high-quality education and care, while also protecting their rights and welfare. Furthermore, the state can also provide financial assistance to families who need it to afford the education and care options that they choose for their children.

Another important aspect to consider is that children come from diverse backgrounds and families have different needs, it's important for the state to provide a variety of education and care options for families to choose from. This ensures that all families, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status, have access to high-quality education and care options for their children.

In conclusion, the family, not the state, should be the primary decision-maker when it comes to the education and care of children. Parents are the ones who know their children best and are best suited to make informed decisions about what type of education and care is best for them. Allowing families to choose their children's education and care options provides them with more flexibility, autonomy and can lead to better outcomes for children and families. However, the state still plays an important role in ensuring that education and care options meet certain standards of quality and safety, and providing a variety of education and care options for families to choose from.",1
538,2039.a2.txt,Adoption for gay couples: towards an open-minded society,"Adoption is a complex issue that raises many ethical, legal, and social questions. One of the most debated topics within adoption is whether or not gay couples should be allowed to adopt children. In this essay, I will argue that adoption by gay couples should be allowed, as it is a step towards a more open-minded and inclusive society.

The first reason why adoption by gay couples should be allowed is that it is a matter of equality. All individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, should have the same rights and opportunities, including the right to adopt a child. Denying gay couples the right to adopt is discriminatory and goes against the principles of equality and fairness.

Additionally, allowing gay couples to adopt can also benefit the children who are in need of a loving and stable home. Studies have shown that children raised by gay couples fare just as well as those raised by straight couples, in terms of their emotional, social and psychological development. Moreover, there are many children in need of adoption, and gay couples can provide them with a loving and stable home, which is essential for their development and well-being.

Furthermore, society should be more open-minded and accepting of diversity, including diversity in families. Adoption by gay couples can help to break down stereotypes and prejudices about what constitutes a ""normal"" family. It can also help to promote acceptance and understanding of different lifestyles and family structures.

However, it's important to note that the adoption process should be based on the best interests of the child, rather than the sexual orientation of the potential adoptive parents. It's crucial that the child's needs, safety, and well-being are taken into account when making a decision about adoption.

Moreover, there are also some concerns and challenges related to adoption by gay couples, such as the legal and social issues that may arise, especially in countries where same-sex marriage is not yet legal. Additionally, there may be resistance and opposition from some members of society who may not be accepting of gay couples adopting children.

In conclusion, adoption by gay couples should be allowed as it is a step towards a more open-minded and inclusive society. Denying gay couples the right to adopt is discriminatory and goes against the principles of equality and fairness. Allowing gay couples to adopt can also benefit the children who are in need of a loving and stable home. It's important that the child's needs, safety, and well-being are taken into account when making a decision about adoption and society should be more open-minded and accepting of diversity, including diversity in families. However, it's important to address the legal and social challenges that may arise and to educate society about the benefits of adoption for gay couples.",1
539,2040.a2.txt,"Violent pornography, todays cause of moral panic","Pornography has been a controversial topic for many years, and the debate over its effects on individuals and society continues to rage on. One area of concern is the proliferation of violent pornography, which some argue is causing a moral panic in today's society. In this essay, I will explore the topic of violent pornography and its effects on individuals and society.

First, it is important to define what is meant by violent pornography. Violent pornography refers to any pornographic material that depicts acts of physical or sexual violence. This can include acts such as rape, BDSM, and other forms of non-consensual acts.

One of the main concerns about violent pornography is that it can lead to desensitization and normalization of violence in individuals. Studies have shown that exposure to violent pornography can lead to increased aggression and a lack of empathy for victims of violence. This can be especially concerning for young people who may not yet have fully developed their sense of morality and ethics.

Furthermore, violent pornography can also contribute to the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes and attitudes towards women and other marginalized groups. Many violent pornographic materials depict women as submissive and objectified, which can contribute to a culture that devalues and mistreats women.

Moreover, some argue that the proliferation of violent pornography is causing a moral panic in society, as it is seen as a threat to traditional values and morals. This can lead to censorship and restriction of access to pornographic materials, which can have a negative impact on freedom of expression and the rights of adults to access legal materials.

However, it's important to note that not all pornography is violent and not all individuals who consume pornography will be affected negatively. Moreover, it's important to have a nuanced understanding of the effects of pornography as it can have a positive effect on some individuals, and some people may find it as a healthy way to express their sexuality.

Additionally, censorship and restriction of access to pornographic materials may not be the best solution to the problem of violent pornography. Rather, the focus should be on education and awareness-raising about the potential harms of violent pornography and the importance of consent and respect in sexual relationships.

In conclusion, violent pornography is a cause of concern in today's society, as it can lead to desensitization and normalization of violence, perpetuate harmful stereotypes and attitudes, and contribute to a moral panic. However, it's important to have a nuanced understanding of the effects of pornography, and the focus should be on education and awareness-raising rather than censorship and restriction of access to pornographic materials.",1
540,2041.a2.txt,Sweden - out of the EU,"The question of whether Sweden should leave the European Union (EU) has been a topic of debate for many years. Some argue that Sweden should leave the EU in order to regain control of its own affairs and to better protect its national interests. Others argue that remaining in the EU is in the best interest of Sweden, as it provides access to a larger market and greater economic stability. In this essay, I will explore the pros and cons of Sweden leaving the EU, also known as ""Swexit"".

One of the main arguments for Sweden leaving the EU is that it would regain control of its own affairs. The EU has a significant impact on the laws and regulations that govern Sweden, and some argue that this can undermine the country's democratic process. By leaving the EU, Sweden would be able to make its own decisions and laws, without having to comply with EU regulations.

Additionally, some argue that leaving the EU would be beneficial for Sweden's economy. The EU has a common market and a common currency, but also has a history of economic instability. Some argue that by leaving the EU, Sweden would be able to better protect its own economy and to pursue policies that are more beneficial for its own citizens.

Moreover, some argue that leaving the EU would allow Sweden to better protect its own national interests. As a member of the EU, Sweden is required to comply with the decisions and policies of the EU, even if they do not align with the country's own interests. By leaving the EU, Sweden would be able to pursue its own foreign policy and to make its own decisions about issues such as immigration and defense.

On the other hand, there are also arguments for why Sweden should remain in the EU. One of the main arguments is that the EU provides access to a larger market and greater economic stability. Being a member of the EU allows Sweden to trade freely with other member countries, and to access a market of over 500 million people. This can be beneficial for the country's businesses and for the overall economy.

Furthermore, the EU provides a framework for cooperation and collaboration on a wide range of issues, such as climate change, security, and human rights. This cooperation can help to promote peace and stability in Europe, and can be beneficial for Sweden and its citizens.

Additionally, leaving the EU would be a complex and difficult process, and could have significant negative consequences for Sweden. It could lead to a loss of access to the EU's common market, which could negatively impact the country's economy, and could lead to a loss of influence on the international stage.

In conclusion, the question of whether Sweden should leave the EU is a complex and controversial one, with valid arguments on both sides. While leaving the EU would allow Sweden to regain control of its own affairs and to better protect its national interests, remaining in the EU provides access to a larger market and greater economic stability. Moreover, leaving the EU would be a complex and difficult process with potential negative consequences. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not Sweden should leave the EU is one that should be made through a democratic process, taking into account all the pros and cons, and the opinion of the citizens.",1
541,2042.a2.txt,NA,"Abortion is a highly controversial and divisive issue that raises many ethical, legal, and social questions. The question of whether or not abortion should be legal and accessible is one that has been debated for decades, with valid arguments on both sides. In this essay, I will explore the issue of abortion, including the arguments for and against it, and some of the ethical and legal considerations involved.

One of the main arguments in favor of abortion is that it is a matter of a woman's right to control her own body. The right to choose whether or not to continue a pregnancy is seen as a fundamental aspect of reproductive rights and personal autonomy. Some argue that denying women access to abortion is a violation of their human rights and an infringement on their personal freedom.

Additionally, some argue that access to safe and legal abortion is essential for the health and well-being of women. Unsafe abortions can lead to serious health complications and even death, particularly for women in developing countries who may not have access to safe and legal abortion services. Legalizing and regulating abortion can help to ensure that women have access to safe and medically appropriate abortion services.

Moreover, some argue that access to abortion is necessary to address societal issues such as poverty, and gender inequality, as it allows women to control their own fertility and make decisions about when and if they want to have children.

On the other hand, there are also arguments against abortion. One of the main arguments is that it is morally wrong to end a human life, and that every life is valuable and should be protected. Some argue that human life begins at conception, and that abortion is therefore equivalent to murder.

Additionally, some argue that access to abortion can lead to a devaluation of human life, and can contribute to a culture that sees human life as disposable. This can have negative consequences for society as a whole, as it can lead to a lack of respect for human life and a lack of empathy for the vulnerable.

Furthermore, some argue that access to abortion can lead to negative emotional and psychological effects for women who choose to have abortions, and can contribute to a society that sees women as disposable.

Additionally, there are also some legal and ethical considerations involved in the issue of abortion. For example, some argue that late-term abortions should not be allowed, as the fetus may be viable, and that there should be limits on when and under what circumstances abortions can be performed. Moreover, some argue that the laws regarding abortion should be based on the best interests of the pregnant woman and the fetus, rather than on religious or ideological beliefs.

In conclusion, abortion is a complex and controversial issue with valid arguments on both sides. The question of whether or not abortion should be legal and accessible is one that raises many ethical, legal, and social questions. The decision of whether or not to have an abortion is a personal and difficult one, and one that should be made by the woman involved, after considering all of the relevant factors, and with access to accurate and unbiased information. Additionally, it is important for society to respect the decision of woman and to have laws that protect the woman's right and health, while also considering the ethical and moral implications of the act.",1
542,2044.a2.txt,"Racism, reserved for Nazis?","Racism is a pervasive and destructive problem that affects individuals and society as a whole. Unfortunately, it is often associated with extreme and hateful ideologies such as Nazism, and many people believe that racism is only perpetuated by a small minority of bigoted individuals. However, the reality is that racism exists in many forms, and it can be found in individuals and institutions across society. In this essay, I will explore the issue of racism and its effects on individuals and society, and why it is important to recognize that racism is not exclusively reserved for Nazis.

First, it is important to define what is meant by racism. Racism refers to any attitudes, behaviors, or policies that are based on the belief that one racial or ethnic group is superior to others. Racism can take many forms, including individual prejudices, discrimination, and institutional policies that perpetuate racial inequality.

One of the main effects of racism is that it harms individuals and communities from marginalized racial and ethnic groups. Racism can lead to discrimination in areas such as employment, housing, and education, which can limit opportunities and access to resources for marginalized groups. Additionally, racism can lead to physical and emotional harm, including violence and trauma.

Moreover, racism can also have a negative impact on society as a whole. Racism can divide communities, contribute to social unrest and even lead to conflict. Racism can also perpetuate inequality and limit opportunities for marginalized groups, and it can limit the potential of society as a whole by hindering the contributions of marginalized individuals.

Another important aspect is that racism is not exclusively reserved for Nazis and other extreme groups. Racism can be found in individuals and institutions across society, regardless of political or ideological beliefs. Racism can be found in individuals who hold unconscious biases and in institutions that perpetuate racial inequality through policies or practices. Racism is not limited to any one political or ideological group, and it can be found in individuals and institutions across the political spectrum.

Furthermore, Racism is a structural problem, it is not just about individual attitudes, but also about the systems, policies and practices that perpetuate racial inequality. This is why it is important to acknowledge and address racism in all its forms, whether it is intentional or not.

Additionally, it is important to recognize that racism is not just limited to minorities, but it also affects the majority group. Racism can lead to harmful stereotypes and prejudices against the majority group, and it can perpetuate divisive and harmful attitudes towards marginalized groups.

In conclusion, racism is a pervasive and destructive problem that affects individuals and society as a whole. It is important to recognize that racism is not exclusively reserved for Nazis and other extreme groups, and it can be found in individuals and institutions across society. It is important to acknowledge and address racism in all its forms, whether it is intentional or not, and to take action to combat racism and promote equality. It is also important to acknowledge that racism is a structural problem and it is not just about individual attitudes, but also about the systems, policies and practices that perpetuate racial inequality.",1
543,2045.a2.txt,Airbag vs. Krock-kudde,"Airbags and Krock-kudde (also known as side-impact airbags) are both safety features found in vehicles that are designed to protect passengers in the event of a collision. While they may seem similar at first glance, there are important differences between the two types of safety features that are worth exploring. In this essay, I will examine the differences between airbags and Krock-kudde, and the advantages and disadvantages of each.

Airbags are safety features that are found in most modern vehicles. They are designed to deploy in the event of a collision, and they inflate quickly to cushion the occupants of the vehicle and prevent them from hitting the steering wheel, dashboard, or other hard surfaces. Airbags are typically located in the steering wheel, dashboard, and side doors of a vehicle. They are triggered by sensors that detect the impact of a collision and signal for the airbags to deploy.

One of the main advantages of airbags is that they can provide a high level of protection for front-seat occupants in the event of a collision. They are particularly effective at preventing injuries to the head, chest, and upper body, which are the most common areas of injury in a collision. Additionally, airbags are relatively inexpensive to manufacture and install, which makes them a cost-effective safety feature.

On the other hand, airbags have some disadvantages. One of the main disadvantages is that they can cause injury or death if they deploy improperly. This can happen if the airbag deploys with too much force, or if it deploys in a way that causes the occupant to hit the steering wheel or dashboard. Additionally, airbags can be dangerous for rear-seat passengers, children and smaller adults, as they may not be able to withstand the force of the airbag deploying.

Krock-kudde, also known as side-impact airbags, are another type of safety feature found in vehicles. They are designed to deploy in the event of a side-impact collision, and they inflate quickly to cushion the occupants of the vehicle and prevent them from hitting the side of the vehicle. Krock-kudde are typically located in the side doors of a vehicle, and they are triggered by sensors that detect the impact of a collision and signal for the Krock-kudde to deploy.

One of the main advantages of Krock-kudde is that they can provide a high level of protection for side-impact collisions, which can be particularly dangerous. They are particularly effective at preventing injuries to the head, chest, and upper body, which are the most common areas of injury in a side-impact collision. Additionally, Krock-kudde are relatively inexpensive to manufacture and install, which makes them a cost-effective safety feature.

On the other hand, Krock-kudde have some disadvantages. One of the main disadvantages is that they may not provide enough protection in the event of a severe collision. Additionally, Krock-kudde may not deploy properly if the collision is not a side-impact collision. Furthermore, Krock-kudde can be dangerous for rear-seat passengers, children and smaller adults, as they may not be able to withstand the force of the Krock-kudde deploying.

In conclusion, both airbags and Krock-kudde are important safety features that can provide a high level of protection for passengers in the event of a collision. However, there are important differences between the two types of safety features. Airbags are designed to protect front-seat occupants in the event of a collision, while Krock-kudde are designed to protect side-impact collisions. Both have their advantages and disadvantages, but together",1
544,2046.a2.txt,Cut downs: The physical education is not seen as a high priority.,"Physical education, or PE, has long been a cornerstone of school curriculums around the world. However, in recent years, there has been a growing trend of cut downs in PE programs, as schools and districts struggle to balance budgets and prioritize other subjects. This is a concerning development, as PE plays a crucial role in promoting the physical and mental well-being of students. In this essay, I will explore the reasons why PE is being cut down, the negative effects of these cuts on students, and why PE should be seen as a high priority.

One of the main reasons for the cut downs in PE programs is budget constraints. With limited funds available, schools and districts often have to make difficult decisions about where to allocate resources. In many cases, PE is seen as a lower priority than subjects like math, science, and English, and as a result, it is often the first to be cut when budgets are tight. Furthermore, schools also face pressure to focus on test scores and academic performance, which can cause PE to be seen as less important than other subjects.

However, the cut downs in PE programs have serious negative effects on students. Physical activity is crucial for the physical and mental well-being of children and young adults. It helps to prevent obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and other health problems. Additionally, physical activity helps to improve mental health, increase self-esteem, and reduce stress. Furthermore, physical education helps students to develop motor skills and coordination, which are important for overall physical development.

Moreover, physical education plays a critical role in helping students to develop teamwork and social skills. PE classes often involve group activities and team sports, which provide students with opportunities to work together, communicate effectively, and develop leadership skills. These are important life skills that are beneficial for students in all aspects of their lives.

Additionally, PE is a subject that can be enjoyed by students of all abilities. It is a subject that can be tailored to students' individual needs and abilities, and it provides opportunities for students to engage in physical activity in ways that are meaningful and enjoyable to them.

Furthermore, physical education can also have a positive impact on academic performance. Studies have shown that regular physical activity can improve attention, concentration, and memory, which can help students to perform better in other subjects. Additionally, physical education can provide students with an opportunity to take a break from academics and engage in something that is fun and enjoyable, which can help to reduce stress and improve overall well-being.

In conclusion, physical education is a crucial subject that plays a vital role in promoting the physical and mental well-being of students. However, the trend of cut downs in PE programs is a concerning development, as it can have serious negative effects on students. PE should be seen as a high priority, and it should be protected from budget cuts. It is important to recognize the value of physical education and to ensure that students have access to quality PE programs. Schools and districts should prioritize physical education and provide students with the opportunity to engage in regular physical activity, which is essential for their overall health and well-being.",1
545,2047.a2.txt,The school in our time,"The school of today is vastly different from the school of even just a few decades ago. Advances in technology, changes in societal values, and shifts in the job market have all led to a re-evaluation of the role of education and the way it is delivered. In this essay, I will explore the current state of the school, the challenges it faces, and the ways in which it is adapting to meet the needs of the 21st century.

One of the most significant changes to the school of today is the increasing emphasis on technology. From laptops and tablets in the classroom, to online resources and distance learning programs, technology has become an integral part of the educational experience. This has led to a more interactive and dynamic learning environment, where students can access information and resources from anywhere, at any time. Additionally, technology has also made it possible for students to take part in virtual field trips, collaborate with peers from around the world, and access specialized resources that may not be available in their local area.

The school of today also faces the challenge of preparing students for a rapidly changing job market. The world of work is constantly evolving, and the skills that were in demand just a few years ago may no longer be relevant. Schools must now focus on developing critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity skills to ensure that students are equipped with the tools they need to succeed in the future. Additionally, many schools are now incorporating more hands-on and experiential learning opportunities, such as internships and apprenticeships, to give students real-world experience and a better understanding of the types of careers that are available to them.

Another significant change to the school of today is the shifting values of society. There is now a greater emphasis on inclusivity, diversity, and equity in education. Schools must now work to create a more inclusive learning environment, where all students feel valued and respected, regardless of their background. This includes providing support for students with different learning needs, as well as creating opportunities for students from different cultures and backgrounds to learn from one another.

The school of today also faces the challenge of providing a safe and secure environment for students. Safety concerns, such as bullying, cyberbullying, and school shootings, have become more prevalent in recent years. Schools must now work to create a culture of safety and respect, where students feel supported and protected, and where any incidents of bullying or harassment are dealt with quickly and effectively.

In conclusion, the school of today is vastly different from the school of the past. It is now a more technology-driven and inclusive environment, where students are prepared for a rapidly changing job market, and where safety and security are of paramount importance. While these changes have brought many benefits, they have also presented new challenges that must be addressed. Schools must continue to adapt and evolve to meet the needs of the 21st century, and ensure that they are providing students with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the future.",1
546,2048.a2.txt,Spice Up Your Vocabulary: Why Feminism Is Still An Important Word,"Feminism is a word that has been used for decades, and yet it remains a topic of debate and controversy. Some argue that the term is no longer relevant, while others believe that it is more important than ever. In this essay, I will explore the reasons why feminism is still an important word, and why it is crucial to use it in today's society.

Firstly, feminism is still important because gender inequality persists in many areas of society. Despite the progress that has been made in recent years, women continue to face discrimination in the workplace, in politics, and in their personal lives. They are still paid less than men for the same work, and they are underrepresented in leadership positions. Additionally, women continue to face harassment and violence, both online and offline. This is why it is important to keep using the word feminism, as it serves as a reminder that there is still work to be done to achieve gender equality.

Secondly, feminism is still important because it is not just about women. The word feminism encompasses the belief that all genders should have equal rights and opportunities. This includes advocating for the rights of transgender and non-binary individuals, who often face even more discrimination than cisgender women. By using the word feminism, we can ensure that the movement is inclusive and that everyone's rights are protected.

Thirdly, using the word feminism helps to challenge harmful stereotypes and societal norms. It is important to use the word feminism to call out and challenge the ways in which society perpetuates gender stereotypes, such as the idea that men should be dominant and aggressive, while women should be submissive and nurturing. By using the word feminism, we can work towards creating a society where individuals are free to be themselves, without being constrained by harmful stereotypes.

Moreover, the word feminism is important in terms of language and representation. Using the word feminism is about claiming language and representation for the movement, it is about taking ownership of the word and using it as a tool for change. By using the word feminism, we can ensure that our voices are heard and that our concerns are taken seriously.

Furthermore, using the word feminism is about recognizing the history and contributions of the feminist movement. The word feminism is a representation of the work and sacrifices of the generations of women who fought for the rights that we have today. By using the word feminism, we pay homage to the work of the past and continue the fight for a better future.

In conclusion, feminism is a word that is still incredibly important in today's society. Despite the progress that has been made, gender inequality persists, and it is crucial to use the word feminism to remind us that there is still work to be done. Additionally, feminism is not just about women, it is about advocating for the rights of all genders. By using the word feminism, we can challenge harmful stereotypes, claim language and representation, and recognize the contributions of the past feminist movements. The word feminism is a powerful tool for change, and it is essential to continue using it in our everyday conversations and actions.",1
547,2049.a2.txt,"What the politicians should do is place foreigners in different areas. Otherwise it won't be long until we have a hypersegregated Uppsala. It won't be long until Gottsunda is entitled ""little Mecca"".","Racism is a pervasive and persistent problem in society. It is a belief that one race is inherently superior to another, and it is used to justify discrimination and oppression based on race. Racism can take many forms, from individual acts of discrimination to systemic and institutionalized racism. In this essay, I will explore the different forms of racism and the impact it has on individuals and society as a whole.

Individual racism is perhaps the most visible form of racism. It is characterized by discriminatory actions and attitudes towards people of a certain race. Examples of individual racism include racial slurs, hate crimes, and discrimination in the workplace or housing. These acts of racism can have a devastating impact on the individuals who are targeted, causing emotional distress, economic hardship, and even physical harm.

Institutional racism is another form of racism that is deeply ingrained in society. It refers to the ways in which racist policies and practices are built into the structures and systems of society. Examples of institutional racism include discriminatory laws, policies, and practices in areas such as housing, education, criminal justice, and healthcare. These institutionalized systems perpetuate racial disparities and discrimination, making it more difficult for people of color to access the same opportunities and resources as white people.

Systemic racism is a more subtle form of racism that is often invisible to those who are not directly impacted by it. It is characterized by the ways in which society's systems and institutions perpetuate racial disparities and discrimination. This can include everything from the way neighborhoods are zoned to the way the criminal justice system is designed, these systems create and maintain racial disparities that are often not intentional, but still harmful.

Racism also has a significant impact on mental health, with studies showing that people of color who experience racism are at a higher risk of developing mental health issues such as depression, anxiety and PTSD. Racism can also lead to a sense of isolation and alienation, as well as a lack of trust in institutions and authority figures.

Racism also has a significant impact on the economic status of people of color, with studies showing that people of color are more likely to live in poverty, have lower levels of education, and have lower-paying jobs than white people. This is due to the fact that people of color often face discrimination in the workplace, housing market, and in other areas that can make it difficult for them to attain the same opportunities and resources as white people.

Furthermore, racism also has a significant impact on the criminal justice system, with studies showing that people of color are more likely to be stopped, searched, arrested, and imprisoned than white people. This is due to the fact that people of color often face discrimination in the criminal justice system, leading to racial disparities in arrests, convictions, and sentencing.

In conclusion, racism is a pervasive and persistent problem in society that takes many forms and has a significant impact on individuals and society as a whole. It is characterized by discriminatory actions and attitudes towards people of a certain race, as well as by racist policies and practices built into the structures and systems of society. Racism has a significant impact on mental and physical health, economic status, and the criminal justice system. It is crucial that society acknowledges and addresses racism in all its forms and work towards creating a more just and equitable society for all.",1
548,2050.a2.txt,Affirmative Action: integrate society and helping minorities,"Affirmative action is a set of policies and practices designed to promote diversity and inclusion in education, the workplace, and other areas of society. The goal of affirmative action is to address the historical and ongoing effects of discrimination by providing opportunities and resources to marginalized groups, including people of color, women, and people with disabilities. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of affirmative action and why it is necessary to integrate society and help minorities.

One of the main benefits of affirmative action is that it helps to promote diversity and integration in society. By providing opportunities and resources to marginalized groups, affirmative action helps to break down barriers and create a more inclusive and equitable society. This is especially important in areas such as education and the workplace, where diversity and inclusivity can lead to improved performance and productivity.

Affirmative action also helps to level the playing field for marginalized groups, who have traditionally been excluded from opportunities and resources due to discrimination. For example, by providing scholarships and financial aid to students from underrepresented groups, affirmative action can help to ensure that all students have an equal chance to pursue higher education. Similarly, by providing training and mentoring programs, affirmative action can help to ensure that all workers have an equal chance to advance in their careers.

Another benefit of affirmative action is that it helps to address the ongoing effects of past discrimination. Discrimination is a pervasive problem that has had a lasting impact on marginalized groups, and it is important to take steps to remedy this injustice. Affirmative action is one way to do this, as it helps to provide opportunities and resources to those who have been historically excluded and disadvantaged.

Affirmative action also has a positive impact on society as a whole. By promoting diversity and inclusivity, affirmative action helps to create a more tolerant and understanding society. This, in turn, can lead to improved social cohesion, reduced prejudice and discrimination, and greater understanding and acceptance of different cultures, perspectives, and identities.

However, it is important to note that affirmative action is not a perfect solution and it has been criticized for its potential to create reverse discrimination. Some argue that it is unfair to provide special treatment to certain groups based on their race or gender, and that it is not necessary in today's society. Additionally, some critics argue that affirmative action policies can lead to quotas and lower standards for certain groups, which can result in unqualified candidates being hired or admitted to schools.

Despite these criticisms, affirmative action is still necessary to ensure that marginalized groups have equal opportunities and resources. The fact is that discrimination is still a pervasive problem in society, and affirmative action is one way to address it. Furthermore, affirmative action policies can be designed in a way to avoid quotas and lower standards, by focusing on creating opportunities and resources for marginalized groups, rather than quotas or quotas-based policies.

In conclusion, affirmative action is a necessary tool to integrate society and help minorities. It is a set of policies and practices designed to promote diversity and inclusion, and to address the historical and ongoing effects of discrimination. Affirmative action provides opportunities and resources to marginalized groups, helps to level the playing field, and promotes a more inclusive and equitable society. While affirmative action is not a perfect solution, it is still necessary to ensure that marginalized groups have equal opportunities and resources. It is important to continue to support affirmative action and to work towards creating a more just and equitable society for all.",1
549,2055.a2.txt,Should it be against the law to be a Nazi?,"The question of whether or not it should be against the law to be a Nazi is a complex and controversial one. On one hand, some argue that freedom of speech and expression are fundamental rights that should be protected, even for those with hateful or extreme ideologies. On the other hand, others argue that the ideologies and actions promoted by Nazism are so harmful and dangerous that they should be banned and criminalized. In this essay, I will explore both sides of this debate and ultimately argue that it should be against the law to be a Nazi.

One of the main arguments for allowing Nazis to freely express their beliefs is that freedom of speech and expression are fundamental rights that should be protected for all individuals, regardless of their ideologies. This argument holds that any attempts to criminalize or suppress speech, even hate speech, is a violation of these rights and could lead to a slippery slope of censorship and repression. Additionally, some argue that allowing Nazis to express their beliefs, however repugnant, allows for public scrutiny and condemnation, which is a more effective way to combat their ideas.

On the other hand, there are strong arguments for criminalizing Nazism and similar ideologies. Firstly, the ideologies and actions promoted by Nazism, such as racial superiority and genocide, are fundamentally harmful and dangerous. They incite violence and discrimination against marginalized groups, leading to serious human rights abuses. Furthermore, the history of the Holocaust, and the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime serve as a stark reminder of the devastating consequences of allowing such ideologies to flourish.

Additionally, allowing Nazis to freely express their beliefs normalizes and legitimizes their ideas, making it more difficult to combat them. It also sends a message to marginalized groups that their safety and well-being are not a priority, and it can also create an unsafe environment for them.

Furthermore, hate speech laws, which criminalize expressions of racism, anti-Semitism, and other forms of hate, already exist in many countries and have been upheld by courts as a legitimate way to protect marginalized groups from harm. These laws are often narrowly tailored to target only the most extreme and inciting speech, and do not infringe on freedom of expression or free speech rights.

It is also important to note that criminalizing Nazism and similar ideologies does not necessarily mean that individuals will be punished for their beliefs alone, but rather for their actions that incite violence and discrimination. This includes acts of hate speech, violence, discrimination, and incitement to commit crimes.

In conclusion, while the question of whether or not it should be against the law to be a Nazi is a complex and controversial one, ultimately, it should be against the law. The ideologies and actions promoted by Nazism are fundamentally harmful and dangerous, and have led to serious human rights abuses in the past. Additionally, allowing Nazis to freely express their beliefs normalizes and legitimizes their ideas and create an unsafe environment for marginalized groups. Hate speech laws, which criminalize expressions of racism, anti-Semitism, and other forms of hate, already exist in many countries and have been upheld by courts as a legitimate way to protect marginalized groups from harm. It is crucial to take action to combat these harmful ideologies and ensure the safety and well-being of marginalized groups.",1
550,2056.a2.txt,"ENGLISH, WHEN IS THE RIGHT TIME?","English is widely considered to be the global language of business and communication, with over 1 billion people speaking it as a first or second language. As such, many people may wonder when is the right time to learn English. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of learning English, the different ages at which it can be learned, and the different methods for learning it.

One of the main benefits of learning English is that it can open up a wide range of opportunities for people in the job market. English is the language of business and commerce, and is widely used in international trade, finance, and technology. As such, many companies and organizations require employees who are fluent in English, and the ability to speak English can be a major asset in the job market. Additionally, English is widely spoken in many countries, and being able to speak it can greatly facilitate travel and communication with people from different cultures.

Another benefit of learning English is that it can help to improve cognitive development and brain function. Studies have shown that bilingual and multilingual individuals have better cognitive abilities, such as problem-solving, memory, and attention, than monolingual individuals. Additionally, learning a second language can help to delay the onset of age-related cognitive decline and may even reduce the risk of developing certain neurodegenerative diseases.

The best time to learn English depends on the individual and their specific needs and goals. Some people may prefer to learn it at a young age, as children are more likely to acquire a second language faster and more easily than adults. Additionally, young children's brains are more adaptable and can more easily absorb new languages. However, it's never too late to learn a new language and many adults are able to become fluent in English with the right approach and effort.

There are different methods for learning English, such as traditional classroom instruction, immersion programs, and self-study. Traditional classroom instruction is the most common method and usually involves learning grammar and vocabulary through textbooks and lectures. Immersion programs, on the other hand, involve living in an English-speaking country and immersing oneself in the language and culture. Self-study, meanwhile, involves using language learning apps, software, and resources to learn on one's own schedule and at one's own pace.

In conclusion, English is a widely spoken language that can open up many opportunities in the job market and facilitate communication with people from different cultures. The best time to learn English depends on the individual and their specific needs and goals, but it's never too late to start learning. Additionally, there are different methods for learning English, such as traditional classroom instruction, immersion programs, and self-study. It is important to find the right method that suits the individual's learning style, schedule, and goals. Learning English can be challenging but it's also a rewarding experience that can greatly benefit an individual in many aspects of their life.",1
551,2057.a2.txt,EDUCATION MUST BE PROFITABLE,"The idea that education should be profitable is a contentious one, as it raises questions about the purpose and value of education. Some argue that education should be focused on providing students with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in life, while others argue that education should be a profitable venture that generates revenue for schools and educators. In this essay, I will explore the arguments for and against education being profitable, and ultimately argue that while education should not be solely focused on profit, it can and should be structured in a way that allows it to be financially sustainable.

One of the main arguments against education being profitable is that it can lead to a focus on profit over education quality. When education is seen as a means to generate revenue, there is a risk that educators and institutions will prioritize financial gain over providing students with a high-quality education. This can lead to a decrease in the quality of education and a lack of investment in resources and programs that are essential for student success.

Additionally, some argue that education should be a public good that is accessible to all, regardless of their ability to pay. When education is viewed as a profitable venture, there is a risk that it will become inaccessible to certain groups of people, such as low-income students or students from marginalized communities. This can lead to a widening of the education gap between different groups of people, which is detrimental to society as a whole.

On the other hand, there are arguments in favor of education being profitable. One of the main arguments is that it can lead to financial sustainability for schools and educators. When education is viewed as a profitable venture, it can attract investment and funding, which can be used to improve resources and programs, and to improve the overall quality of education. Additionally, when education is profitable, it can lead to increased innovation and creativity, as schools and educators are incentivized to find new and better ways to educate students.

Furthermore, for-profit institutions can also offer an alternative for students who are seeking specific types of education or have different needs than traditional schools can provide. For-profit institutions can be more flexible with their curriculum and can offer a wide range of programs and specializations that are tailored to different students’ needs.

Moreover, a profitable education system can also create job opportunities and contribute to the economy. When the education sector is profitable, it can create jobs for educators and support staff, which can lead to economic growth and development.

It is important to note that education should not be solely focused on profit, but rather on providing students with a high-quality education. However, it is also important to consider the financial sustainability of the education system. This can be achieved by finding a balance between the two. This can be done by creating a system where education is accessible to all, while also finding ways to generate revenue and make the education system financially sustainable.

In conclusion, the idea that education should be profitable is a contentious one, as it raises questions about the purpose and value of education. While education should not be solely focused on profit, it is important to consider the financial sustainability of the education system. This can be achieved by finding a balance between providing students with a high-quality education and generating revenue. Additionally, for-profit institutions can also offer an alternative for students who are seeking specific types of education or have different needs than traditional schools can provide. Education is not only important for the individual but also for the society as a whole, and it should be structured in a way that allows it to be financially sustainable without compromising on the quality of education.",1
552,2058.a2.txt,Girl power - teenage feminism as a misguiding trend,"Girl power and teenage feminism have become increasingly popular in recent years, with many young women embracing these movements as a way to promote gender equality and women's rights. However, some argue that girl power and teenage feminism can be a misguiding trend, as they may not accurately reflect the complexities of the feminist movement and may not be the most effective way to achieve gender equality. In this essay, I will explore the criticisms of girl power and teenage feminism and argue that while these movements can be a positive force for change, they must be approached with caution and consideration.

One of the main criticisms of girl power and teenage feminism is that they tend to focus on individual empowerment and personal success, rather than the systemic issues that underlie gender inequality. This can lead to a lack of attention and action towards issues such as pay gap, sexual harassment, and discrimination in the workplace, which are all critical issues that need to be addressed in order to achieve true gender equality.

Additionally, some argue that girl power and teenage feminism can be divisive, as they tend to focus on the experiences and needs of cisgender, able-bodied, middle to upper-class, and straight women, while ignoring the experiences and needs of women from marginalized communities. This can lead to further marginalization and exclusion of certain groups of women, which is counter to the goal of achieving true gender equality.

Another criticism is that girl power and teenage feminism can be shallow and superficial, as they often focus on the surface-level issues of representation and visibility, rather than the more complex and nuanced issues that underlie gender inequality. This can lead to a lack of understanding and action towards the deeper, structural issues that contribute to gender inequality, such as economic and political power imbalances.

Furthermore, girl power and teenage feminism can also be criticized for promoting a narrow and limiting definition of femininity, which can be harmful to girls and women who do not fit into this mold. Many teenage girls may feel pressure to conform to a certain standard of beauty, behavior and success in order to be considered “empowered” which can be detrimental to their mental and physical well-being.

However, it is important to note that girl power and teenage feminism can also be a positive force for change. They can provide young women with a sense of agency and empowerment, and can encourage them to engage in activism and advocacy. Additionally, girl power and teenage feminism can help to raise awareness about gender inequality and can inspire young women to take action to promote gender equality.

In conclusion, girl power and teenage feminism can be a misguiding trend, as they may not accurately reflect the complexities of the feminist movement and may not be the most effective way to achieve gender equality. It is important to approach these movements with caution and consideration, and to be aware of their potential limitations. While girl power and teenage feminism can be a positive force for change, they must be approached in a way that is inclusive and intersectional, and that addresses the systemic issues that underlie gender inequality. Additionally, it is important to promote a broader definition of femininity and empowerment, one that is not limited by societal expectations and stereotypes. The goal should always be to achieve true gender equality, which requires an understanding of the complexities and nuances of the feminist movement.",1
553,2059.a2.txt,It's time to stop cuts in school budgets,"The issue of school budget cuts has become a growing concern in recent years, as many schools and educators have had to grapple with reduced funding and limited resources. This can have a significant impact on the quality of education and the ability of students to succeed. In this essay, I will argue that it is time to stop cuts in school budgets, and that investing in education is critical for the future of our society.

One of the main reasons to stop cuts in school budgets is that it can have a negative impact on the quality of education. Schools that have to operate with limited resources may not be able to provide students with the necessary materials and equipment they need to learn. Additionally, budget cuts can lead to larger class sizes, which can make it more difficult for teachers to give individual attention to each student. This can have a significant impact on student achievement, especially for students who are struggling.

Another reason to stop cuts in school budgets is that it can have a negative impact on the mental and physical well-being of students. Schools that have limited resources may not be able to provide students with the support and services they need to succeed. This can lead to increased stress and anxiety among students, which can have a negative impact on their mental health. Additionally, budget cuts can also lead to the elimination of physical education programs and extracurricular activities, which can have a negative impact on the physical health of students.

Moreover, school budget cuts can also have a negative impact on the ability of schools to attract and retain talented teachers. When schools have limited resources, they may not be able to offer competitive salaries and benefits to teachers. This can make it more difficult for schools to attract and retain talented educators, which can have a negative impact on student achievement.

Furthermore, school budget cuts can also have a negative impact on the ability of schools to provide students with the support and services they need to succeed. When schools have limited resources, they may not be able to provide students with the support and services they need to succeed. This can lead to increased stress and anxiety among students, which can have a negative impact on their mental health. Additionally, budget cuts can also lead to the elimination of physical education programs and extracurricular activities, which can have a negative impact on the physical health of students.

Investing in education is critical for the future of our society. A well-educated population is essential for a healthy democracy, a robust economy and a successful society. Investing in education is an investment in the future of our society, and it is essential to ensure that all students have the resources and support they need to succeed.

In conclusion, it is time to stop cuts in school budgets, as it can have a negative impact on the quality of education, the mental and physical well-being of students, the ability of schools to attract and retain talented teachers and the ability of schools to provide students with the support and services they need to succeed. Investing in education is critical for the future of our society, and it is essential to ensure that all students have the resources and support they need to succeed. It is important to remember that education is an investment in the future of our society and should not be compromised by budget cuts. It should be a priority of the government to provide the necessary funds to ensure that all students have access to quality education.",1
554,2060.a2.txt,THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUTING,"Commuting is an essential part of modern life, as it allows people to travel to and from work, school, and other daily activities. However, despite its importance, commuting is often viewed as a nuisance and a source of stress. In this essay, I will argue that commuting is not only important but also essential for society, as it plays a critical role in connecting people, fostering economic growth, and promoting sustainability.

One of the most obvious reasons why commuting is essential is that it allows people to access job opportunities and other essential services. Without the ability to commute, many people would be unable to find work or access healthcare, education, and other important resources. This would lead to increased poverty and social isolation, which would have a negative impact on society as a whole.

Another important aspect of commuting is that it promotes economic growth. When people can commute to work, they are able to take advantage of job opportunities that might not be available in their local area. This allows businesses to access a larger pool of workers, which can increase productivity and economic growth. Additionally, a well-functioning transportation system allows for the movement of goods and services, which is crucial for the economic development.

Commuting also plays a critical role in fostering social connections. When people commute, they are able to interact with a diverse group of people, which can help to break down social barriers and promote understanding and tolerance. Additionally, commuting allows people to access community resources, such as libraries and parks, which can have a positive impact on their mental and physical well-being.

Finally, commuting is essential for promoting sustainability. Cars and buses emit pollutants and add to the traffic congestion, which negatively impacts the environment and public health. However, when people are able to use public transportation, carpool, bike, or walk, it reduces the number of cars on the road, and thus decrease emissions, traffic congestion, and dependence on fossil fuels. Additionally, sustainable forms of transportation such as biking and walking also promote physical activity, which can have a positive impact on public health.

In conclusion, commuting is an essential part of modern life, as it allows people to travel to and from work, school, and other daily activities. Commuting is not only important but also essential for society, as it plays a critical role in connecting people, fostering economic growth, and promoting sustainability. It is crucial for governments to invest in transportation infrastructure and to promote sustainable forms of transportation, in order to ensure that people can access essential services and job opportunities, while also promoting economic growth and protecting the environment. Furthermore, it is important for individuals to make conscious decisions about their commuting choices, in order to reduce their impact on the environment and promote a more sustainable future for all.",1
555,2061.a2.txt,Elders in the families?,"Elders play an important role in many families, serving as mentors, caregivers, and sources of wisdom and guidance. However, as society changes and families become more spread out, it can be increasingly challenging for families to support and care for their elders. In this essay, I will argue that it is important for families to prioritize the well-being and care of their elders, and for society to support and value the contributions of older individuals.

One of the most important reasons to prioritize the well-being of elders in families is that they often serve as caregivers for younger generations. Elders often provide care and support for their children, grandchildren, and other family members, and their contributions are often taken for granted. However, when elders are not able to provide care and support, it can place a significant burden on other family members. Moreover, many older adults provide free care for their grandchildren and other relatives, which saves money and can be beneficial for the whole family.

Additionally, elders often serve as sources of wisdom and guidance, passing on important cultural and familial traditions to future generations. They are often the keepers of family history and customs, and their stories and experiences can provide valuable context and perspective for younger generations. Furthermore, older people can be a source of emotional support and comfort for their family members, especially during difficult times.

Another important aspect of supporting elders in families is that it can promote intergenerational connections and understanding. When families prioritize the well-being of their elders, it can foster a sense of community and shared responsibility among family members of all ages. Additionally, when older adults are able to continue to be active and engaged members of their families and communities, they can continue to make valuable contributions to society.

Moreover, society should also support and value the contributions of older individuals. Ageism, the discrimination of older people, is still a prevalent issue today, and it is important to combat this negative stereotype and to recognize the contributions and value of older adults. Additionally, it is important for society to provide resources and support for older adults to continue to live independently and with dignity, as they age. This includes access to healthcare, financial support, and social and recreational activities.

In conclusion, elders play a crucial role in many families, serving as mentors, caregivers, and sources of wisdom and guidance. It is important for families to prioritize the well-being and care of their elders, and for society to support and value the contributions of older individuals. By fostering intergenerational connections and understanding, and by providing resources and support for older adults to continue to live independently and with dignity, we can ensure that older adults are able to continue to make valuable contributions to society and that families can continue to thrive.",1
556,2062.a2.txt,"An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.","The phrase ""an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth"" is a well-known saying that has been used throughout history to justify the concept of retributive justice. This phrase is often used to suggest that punishment should be meted out in proportion to the crime, with the offender receiving the same harm they inflicted on the victim. However, while this concept may seem appealing on the surface, the idea of ""an eye for an eye"" is ultimately flawed and problematic.

One of the main issues with the concept of ""an eye for an eye"" is that it fails to take into account the complexities of human behavior and the reasons why people commit crimes. People who commit crimes are often driven by a variety of factors, such as poverty, mental illness, or a traumatic past. Punishing these individuals with the same harm they inflicted on the victim is unlikely to address the underlying issues that led to their behavior, and may even make the situation worse.

Another problem with the concept of ""an eye for an eye"" is that it can lead to a cycle of violence. When individuals are punished in a way that is seen as excessively harsh or vengeful, it can lead to feelings of anger and resentment. This, in turn, can lead to retaliation and a further escalation of violence. In this way, the idea of ""an eye for an eye"" can perpetuate a cycle of violence that is ultimately harmful to society as a whole.

Moreover, the concept of ""an eye for an eye"" is often used to justify the use of capital punishment, which is the death penalty. This approach has been widely criticized by human rights activists, as it raises several moral and ethical issues. Capital punishment is a serious and irreversible punishment, and it raises questions about the right to life and the possibility of executing an innocent person. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that the death penalty deters crime more effectively than other forms of punishment.

Furthermore, the concept of ""an eye for an eye"" doesn't consider the possibility of rehabilitation and forgiveness. Retributive justice system focuses on punishment and doesn't give the offender the chance to change or to make amends for their actions. On the other hand, restorative justice aims to repair the harm caused by the crime, bringing the victim, offender, and community together to find a solution that addresses the harm caused by the crime and promotes healing.

In conclusion, the phrase ""an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth"" is a flawed concept that has been used throughout history to justify retributive justice. While the idea of punishment that is proportionate to the crime may seem appealing, it fails to take into account the complexities of human behavior and the reasons why people commit crimes. Moreover, it can lead to a cycle of violence, perpetuate capital punishment and doesn't consider the possibility of rehabilitation and forgiveness. Society should aim to find a more effective and compassionate approach to justice that addresses the underlying issues that lead to crime and promotes healing and reconciliation.",1
557,2063.a2.txt,Learning English at an early age,"Learning a second language, particularly English, at an early age can have numerous benefits for children. English is widely considered as the global language of business and communication, and it is an essential tool for success in today's increasingly interconnected world. Therefore, learning English at an early age can provide children with a significant advantage in their future education and career opportunities.

One of the main benefits of learning English at an early age is that it can improve cognitive development. Studies have shown that children who are exposed to a second language at a young age have better memory and problem-solving skills, as well as an improved ability to multitask. Additionally, learning a second language can also improve overall academic performance, as it can help children develop stronger critical thinking and analytical skills.

Another benefit of learning English at an early age is that it can enhance cultural understanding and appreciation. English is spoken in a wide variety of countries and cultures, and by learning the language, children can gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of different cultures. This can broaden their perspective and help them to become more open-minded and accepting of diversity.

Moreover, learning English at an early age can also provide children with a wider range of opportunities in their future education and career. English is the most commonly used language in international business, and it is also the primary language of instruction in many universities around the world. Thus, children who are proficient in English will have a much greater chance of success in their future careers if they have the language skills to communicate effectively with people from different cultures and backgrounds.

Furthermore, learning English at an early age can also help children to become more independent learners. English is a complex language with many rules and exceptions, and by learning it at an early age, children will be better equipped to learn other languages in the future. Additionally, it will also help children to become more confident in their own abilities, as they will be able to navigate the language more easily.

However, it's important to note that learning a second language at an early age can be challenging. Children's brains are still developing, and it can be difficult for them to grasp all the complex grammar and vocabulary of a language like English. Therefore, it's important that parents and teachers provide children with a supportive and nurturing learning environment, and use age-appropriate teaching methods to help them learn the language.

In conclusion, learning English at an early age can have numerous benefits for children. It can improve cognitive development, enhance cultural understanding and appreciation, provide children with a wider range of opportunities in their future education and career, and help children to become more independent learners. While learning a second language can be challenging for children, with the right approach and support, it can be a valuable and rewarding experience for them.",1
558,2064.a2.txt,Reintroduce the borrowing of course literature,"The reintroduction of the borrowing of course literature would be a beneficial move for students and educational institutions alike. In recent years, many universities and colleges have moved away from traditional textbook borrowing systems and instead have encouraged students to purchase their own course materials. However, this shift has led to a number of negative consequences for students, such as financial burden and lack of access to necessary materials.

One of the main benefits of reintroducing the borrowing of course literature is that it would alleviate financial burden for students. Textbooks can be quite expensive, and many students are unable to afford to purchase all of the materials they need for their classes. This can lead to students having to go without the necessary materials, which can negatively impact their academic performance. By reintroducing the borrowing of course literature, students would have access to the materials they need without having to bear the financial burden of purchasing them.

Another benefit of reintroducing the borrowing of course literature is that it would increase access to necessary materials for students. Many students come from low-income backgrounds and may not have the resources to purchase all of the materials they need for their classes. This can lead to students falling behind in their studies and not being able to fully engage with the material. By reintroducing the borrowing of course literature, students would have greater access to the materials they need to succeed in their classes.

Additionally, reintroducing the borrowing of course literature would be beneficial for the environment. With the shift towards purchasing rather than borrowing textbooks, many students end up with multiple copies of the same book, which can lead to unnecessary waste. Reintroducing the borrowing of course literature would help to reduce this waste, as students would not have to purchase multiple copies of the same book.

Moreover, reintroducing the borrowing of course literature would also benefit educational institutions. By reintroducing the borrowing of course literature, institutions would be able to better track student engagement with the materials and ensure that students have access to the latest editions of the books. Additionally, institutions would also be able to save money by not having to purchase multiple copies of the same books.

However, it's important to note that reintroducing the borrowing of course literature would also require some adjustments. For instance, educational institutions would need to invest in a system that allows them to track and manage the borrowing of textbooks. Additionally, institutions would need to ensure that they have enough copies of each book to meet the demand.

In conclusion, reintroducing the borrowing of course literature would be a beneficial move for both students and educational institutions. It would alleviate financial burden for students, increase access to necessary materials, benefit the environment, and also benefit educational institutions by better tracking student engagement and ensuring the latest editions of books. It's important to consider the potential challenges in the implementation of the system, but overall it would be a positive move to support students' success.

559,2065.a2.txt,Adoption and artificial insemination - a matter of course for homosexuals,"Adoption and artificial insemination are two options that same-sex couples have for starting a family. Both have their own set of benefits and challenges, and the decision of which path to take can be a difficult one.

Adoption is the legal process by which a person or couple becomes the legal parent(s) of a child who is not their biological offspring. Same-sex couples have the same rights to adopt as opposite-sex couples in most countries, but there are still some places where adoption by same-sex couples is not allowed or is restricted. For example, in some US states, adoption agencies are allowed to discriminate against same-sex couples.

The benefits of adoption for same-sex couples include the ability to provide a loving and stable home for a child in need, as well as the opportunity to become a parent without having to go through the biological process of pregnancy and childbirth. Additionally, adoption allows same-sex couples to expand their families without having to rely on a sperm or egg donor, and it can also be a more affordable option than artificial insemination.

However, the adoption process can be lengthy and emotionally taxing. It can also be difficult for same-sex couples to find an agency or private adoption professional that is supportive and welcoming. Additionally, some adopted children may struggle with their identity and may have questions about their biological parents and their origins.

Artificial insemination, on the other hand, is a medical procedure in which sperm is placed into a woman's uterus or fallopian tubes in order to achieve pregnancy. This can be done using fresh or frozen sperm from a known or anonymous donor. Artificial insemination can be done at home using a syringe, or in a clinic using a catheter.

For same-sex couples where one partner is female, artificial insemination can provide the opportunity for one partner to carry and give birth to the child. Additionally, artificial insemination allows for greater control over the genetic makeup of the child, as the sperm donor can be chosen based on physical characteristics or other factors.

However, artificial insemination can be costly and may not be covered by insurance. There is also a risk of multiple pregnancies, which can be dangerous for both the mother and the babies. Furthermore, there may be legal issues to consider, such as the rights of the sperm donor or the non-biological parent.

In conclusion, adoption and artificial insemination are both viable options for same-sex couples who wish to start a family. Each path has its own set of benefits and challenges, and the decision of which to take should be made after careful consideration and consultation with a professional. It's important to remember that, regardless of which path is chosen, the most important thing is that the child is raised in a loving and stable home.",1
560,2067.a2.txt,Unpaid work - a punishment or an opportunity?,"Unpaid work, also known as community service or volunteer work, is a form of punishment that is often given as an alternative to jail time or fines. It is a way for individuals to give back to their community and make amends for their actions. However, unpaid work can also be seen as an opportunity for individuals to learn new skills, gain valuable experience, and make a positive impact on their community.

From a punishment standpoint, unpaid work is often seen as a more lenient alternative to incarceration. It allows individuals to maintain their freedom and continue to support their families, while also making amends for their actions. Furthermore, unpaid work can also be seen as a form of rehabilitation, as it can teach individuals new skills, help them develop a sense of responsibility and accountability, and provide them with an opportunity to give back to their community.

Unpaid work can also be an opportunity for individuals to gain valuable experience and learn new skills. For example, individuals who are assigned to work in a soup kitchen or homeless shelter can learn about the issues of poverty and homelessness and how to help those in need. Furthermore, unpaid work can also be a stepping stone to paid employment, as it can provide individuals with the opportunity to gain experience and build their resumes.

Additionally, unpaid work can also be a way for individuals to make a positive impact on their community. Volunteering can help to address a wide range of social issues, such as poverty, hunger, and homelessness. Furthermore, unpaid work can also help to build stronger, more cohesive communities by bringing people together and fostering a sense of community spirit.

However, unpaid work also has its limitations and can be seen as a double-edged sword, it's often seen as a punishment that disproportionately affects low-income individuals and people of color. It can also be seen as exploitative, as it allows organizations to get work done without having to pay for it. Furthermore, unpaid work can also be seen as a way for the government to shift the cost of punishment from the state to the individual and their family.

Moreover, unpaid work can also be seen as a way for the government to avoid investing in social services and other programs that would address the root causes of crime and poverty. Furthermore, unpaid work can also be seen as a way for the government to avoid addressing issues of racial and economic inequality that are at the root of many social problems.

In conclusion, unpaid work can be seen as both a punishment and an opportunity. It can be a way for individuals to give back to their community and make amends for their actions, while also providing them with the opportunity to gain new skills and make a positive impact. However, it also has limitations and can be seen as a way for the government to avoid addressing the root causes of crime and poverty. Therefore, it's important to consider the motivations behind unpaid work and the impact it has on individuals, families, and communities. It's also important to think about how it can be implemented in a way that is fair and equitable for all.",1
561,2068.a2.txt,Cap - on or off in school,"The debate on whether caps should be worn on or off in schools is a contentious one. There are valid arguments on both sides, and the decision ultimately depends on the specific school and its policies.

One argument in favor of wearing caps on in school is that it is a matter of respect and obedience. School is a place of learning and discipline, and students should be expected to adhere to a certain level of decorum. Wearing a cap on in school is seen as a sign of respect for authority and for the school environment. Additionally, it can be argued that wearing a cap on in school can help to create a sense of unity and belonging among students, as they are all following the same rules and expectations.

Another argument in favor of wearing caps on in school is that it can improve safety. Caps worn on in school can help to identify students and staff, making it easier for school officials to monitor and manage the school environment. Furthermore, caps worn on in school can help to reduce the spread of head lice, which is a common problem in schools.

On the other hand, some argue that students should have the freedom to wear their caps off in school. They argue that caps are a form of personal expression and that students should be allowed to express themselves in a way that makes them feel comfortable and confident. Caps worn off can also be seen as a way for students to express their individuality and stand out from the crowd.

Additionally, some argue that wearing caps on in school can be uncomfortable and distracting. Caps worn on in school can cause headaches and discomfort, which can affect a student's ability to focus and learn. Furthermore, caps worn on in school can interfere with a student's vision and hearing, which can also be a distraction.

Moreover, it's important to consider the cultural and religious significance of wearing a cap. For some students, wearing a cap on or off can be seen as a form of religious expression, and schools should respect and accommodate these beliefs.

In conclusion, the decision on whether caps should be worn on or off in school is a complex one. There are valid arguments on both sides, and the decision ultimately depends on the specific school and its policies. Schools should consider the various perspectives and take into account the safety, comfort, and cultural and religious significance of wearing a cap before making a decision. It's also important to communicate the rules and expectations clearly to the students and staff, and to enforce them fairly and consistently.",1

Those who advocate for stopping women's right to an abortion argue that it is necessary to save the life of the unborn child. However, this argument overlooks the fact that denying women the right to an abortion can have serious negative consequences for their own health and well-being.

One of the main arguments against women's right to an abortion is that it is morally wrong to end the life of an unborn child. Those who hold this view believe that the fetus has the same rights as a born person and that terminating a pregnancy is equivalent to murder. They argue that society has a duty to protect the life of the unborn and that stopping women's right to an abortion is necessary to do so.

However, this argument overlooks the fact that pregnancy can also have serious negative consequences for the health and well-being of the woman carrying the fetus. In some cases, continuing a pregnancy can be life-threatening for the woman, whether it's due to a medical condition, financial instability or other reasons. It is important to consider the well-being of the mother as well as the potential life of the fetus.

Furthermore, denying women the right to an abortion does not necessarily lead to fewer abortions; it simply makes the procedure less safe. In countries where abortion is illegal or highly restricted, many women resort to dangerous methods such as self-induced abortions or seeking the services of untrained practitioners. This can lead to serious health complications and even death.

Moreover, denying women the right to an abortion can also have negative consequences for their social and economic well-being. For example, a woman who is not able to access an abortion may be forced to continue an unwanted pregnancy, which can disrupt her education, career, and financial stability. Furthermore, it can lead to additional burden on the woman and her family, and can have a negative impact on their overall well-being.

Another important aspect to consider is that the decision to have an abortion should ultimately be left to the woman and her family. It is a personal decision that should be made with the guidance of medical professionals, and not dictated by the government or society. It's also important to note that the decision to have an abortion is not taken lightly and it's often a difficult and emotional process for the woman and her family.

In conclusion, stopping women's right to an abortion is not a solution to protect the life of the unborn child. It overlooks the fact that pregnancy can also have serious negative consequences for the health and well-being of the woman carrying the fetus. Furthermore, denying women the right to an abortion can lead to dangerous methods and negative consequences for their social and economic well-being. It's important to consider the well-being of both the mother and the potential life of the fetus, as well as the autonomy of the woman in making a personal decision. It's also important to ensure that women have access to safe and legal abortion services, as well as comprehensive sex education and access to contraception to help prevent unwanted pregnancies.",1
563,2070.a2.txt,No sex until marriage,"The idea of not having sex until marriage is a traditional and conservative one that is based on the belief that sex should be reserved for the sanctity of marriage. Those who advocate for this idea argue that it promotes self-control, moral values, and the preservation of traditional institutions such as marriage. However, there are also valid arguments against this idea, as it can be limiting, unrealistic and can lead to negative consequences.

One of the main arguments for not having sex until marriage is that it promotes self-control and moral values. This belief is based on the idea that sex should be reserved for the commitment and exclusivity of marriage. Proponents of this idea argue that abstaining from sex before marriage can help individuals develop self-discipline and self-control, as well as promote moral values such as respect, trust, and commitment.

However, this idea can also be limiting and unrealistic. Not everyone follows the traditional path of getting married, and some individuals may choose to remain single or in non-traditional relationships. Additionally, not everyone who chooses to wait until marriage to have sex will have a successful or fulfilling marriage. Furthermore, sex is a normal and natural human desire, and expecting someone to abstain from it until marriage can be unrealistic and can lead to feelings of shame or guilt.

Moreover, this idea can also have negative consequences on one's mental, physical and emotional well-being. It can lead to individuals feeling ashamed of their natural desires and can negatively impact their self-esteem and self-worth. Additionally, it can lead to individuals feeling guilty or ashamed for having sex before marriage, which can have a negative impact on their mental and emotional well-being. Furthermore, it can lead to individuals having unsafe sexual practices and lack of knowledge about sex education and contraception which can lead to negative health outcomes.

Furthermore, this idea can also be used as a tool for control and oppression, particularly for women. Societal and cultural expectations that women should remain virgins until marriage, can be used as a way to control women's sexuality and bodies. It can also be used to justify violence and discrimination against women who do not conform to these expectations.

In conclusion, the idea of not having sex until marriage is a traditional and conservative one that is based on the belief that sex should be reserved for the sanctity of marriage. While it may promote self-control, moral values and the preservation of traditional institutions, it can also be limiting, unrealistic and can lead to negative consequences. It's important to acknowledge that sex is a normal and natural human desire, and that individuals should be free to make their own choices about their sexuality. Furthermore, it's important to ensure that individuals have access to comprehensive sex education and contraception, which can help to prevent unwanted pregnancies and promote safe sexual practices.",1
564,2071.a2.txt,Social allowance are not for people who can work,"Social allowances are government-funded financial assistance programs designed to provide support to individuals and families in need. These programs are intended to help people who are unable to support themselves financially, whether due to unemployment, low-income, disability, or other reasons. However, there is a common belief that social allowances should not be provided to individuals who are able to work. This belief is based on the idea that these individuals should be able to support themselves and that providing them with financial assistance is a form of ""handout"" that encourages laziness and dependency.

One of the main arguments against providing social allowances to individuals who are able to work is that it creates a dependency culture. This belief is based on the idea that providing people with financial assistance will make them less motivated to find work and will encourage them to rely on government support. Additionally, it can be argued that providing social allowances to people who are able to work can lead to an increase in the number of people who are dependent on government assistance, which can be a burden on society and on the economy.

However, this argument overlooks the fact that finding work is not always easy and that there are many factors that can make it difficult for individuals to support themselves financially. For example, there may be a lack of jobs in certain areas, discrimination in the workplace, or a lack of affordable childcare, which can make it difficult for some individuals to find and maintain employment. Additionally, the cost of living is increasing and the wages are not keeping pace, which makes it difficult for some individuals to make ends meet.

Moreover, it's important to consider that many people who are able to work may have disabilities, chronic illnesses or other barriers that make it difficult for them to work. Additionally, many people who are able to work may be working in low-paying or part-time jobs that do not provide them with enough income to support themselves and their families.

Additionally, social allowances can be seen as a safety net that can help people in need to have access to basic needs such as food, shelter, and healthcare. It can also serve as a bridge to help people who are struggling to support themselves to get back on their feet, and help them to find better jobs and improve their economic situation. Furthermore, social allowances can also help to reduce poverty and inequality, which can lead to more stable and cohesive communities.

In conclusion, the belief that social allowances should not be provided to individuals who are able to work is based on the idea that these individuals should be able to support themselves and that providing them with financial assistance is a form of ""handout"" that encourages laziness and dependency. However, this belief overlooks the fact that finding work is not always easy and that there are many factors that can make it difficult for individuals to support themselves financially. It's important to consider the specific circumstances of the individual and provide support that helps them to improve their situation. It's also important to ensure that social allowances are part of a comprehensive strategy that includes access to education, job training, and childcare, which can help to reduce poverty and inequality.",1
565,2072.a2.txt,Student loans: A lifetime in debt,"Student loans are a common way for students to finance their education, with many students taking out loans to cover the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses. However, as the cost of education continues to rise, many students are graduating with large amounts of student loan debt that can take a lifetime to pay off. This has led to a growing concern that student loans are creating a generation of individuals who are burdened with debt for their entire lives.

One of the main reasons why student loans are seen as a lifetime in debt is that the amount of debt that students are taking on is increasing. The cost of tuition and fees at colleges and universities has risen significantly in recent years, and many students are taking out larger loans to cover these costs. Furthermore, the interest rates on student loans are often higher than those on other types of loans, which can make it difficult for students to pay off their debt in a timely manner. As a result, many students are graduating with large amounts of debt that can take decades to pay off.

Another reason why student loans are seen as a lifetime in debt is that they are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. Unlike other types of debt, such as credit card debt or medical debt, student loan debt cannot be discharged in bankruptcy. This means that students who are unable to pay off their loans will be stuck with the debt for their entire lives. Additionally, the government can garnish wages and tax refunds for student loans, which can make it even more difficult for individuals to get out of debt.

Additionally, student loan debt can also have a negative impact",1
566,2074.a2.txt,Europe: Co-operation or every one for themselves?,"The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 27 member countries that are located primarily in Europe. The EU was established to promote economic co-operation and to prevent war between its member countries. However, the question of whether the EU is a model of co-operation or if countries are operating every one for themselves is a contentious one.

On one hand, the EU has been successful in promoting economic co-operation among its member countries. The EU's single market allows for the free movement of goods, services, people, and capital within the EU, which has led to increased trade and economic growth. Additionally, the EU's common currency, the Euro, has also helped to promote economic co-operation and stability within the EU.

Furthermore, the EU's institutions such as the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council, play a key role in promoting co-operation among member countries by creating common policies on issues such as trade, environment, and security. The EU also provides a platform for member countries to come together and work towards common goals, such as climate change and migration.

On the other hand, there are also arguments that the EU is not a model of co-operation and that countries are operating every one for themselves. One example of this is the ongoing migration crisis, where EU member countries have struggled to reach a common solution and have been criticized for not showing enough solidarity. Additionally, the EU's response to the economic crisis of 2008 has been criticized for being too focused on austerity measures, which has led to economic hardship for many EU citizens.

Furthermore, the EU's decision-making process has also been criticized for being slow, complex and for not being fully inclusive. Many argue that the EU's institutions are not fully representative of citizens and that the EU's decision-making process is too influenced by larger member countries. Moreover, the EU has been facing challenges from populism and nationalism movements that have been gaining traction in recent years, which are critical of the EU's co-operation approach and advocate for a more nationalistic approach.

In conclusion, the EU is a complex entity that can be seen as both a model of co-operation and as a system where countries are operating every one for themselves. The EU has been successful in promoting economic co-operation and stability among its member countries and creating common policies on various issues. However, it has also faced challenges in areas such as migration, economic crisis, and decision-making process, which have led to criticisms that the EU is not fully successful in promoting co-operation among its member countries. It's important to note that the EU is a constantly evolving entity and it's important to strive for constant improvement",1
567,2075.a2.txt,The utter justice or murder sanctioned by the state: Can capital punishment be justified?,"Capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, is the legal process of putting a person to death as a punishment for a crime they have committed. The use of capital punishment is a contentious issue, with strong opinions on both sides. Those who support capital punishment argue that it serves as a deterrent and is a necessary punishment for heinous crimes such as murder. Those who oppose capital punishment argue that it is inhumane, has been shown to be ineffective as a deterrent, and that it is possible for innocent people to be wrongly convicted and executed.

One of the main arguments in favor of capital punishment is that it serves as a deterrent. Supporters of capital punishment argue that the threat of the death penalty deters people from committing crimes. However, studies have shown that there is no evidence to support this claim, and that the death penalty is no more of a deterrent than other forms of punishment such as life imprisonment.

Another argument in favor of capital punishment is that it is a necessary punishment for heinous crimes such as murder. Supporters argue that the taking of a human life warrants the ultimate punishment, and that the death penalty is necessary to ensure justice for the victims and their families. However, many argue that the death penalty is not an effective way to bring closure to the families of the victims and that alternatives such as life imprisonment without parole would serve the same purpose.

On the other hand, many argue that capital punishment is inhumane and that it violates the right to life, liberty, and security of the person. The death penalty is often carried out by means of lethal injection, hanging, electrocution, gas chamber, and other forms that can be painful and cruel. Furthermore, it's not always possible to ensure that the execution process is carried out in a humane manner, leading to potential suffering.

Additionally, capital punishment has been shown to be racially and socioeconomically biased, with a disproportionate number of people of color and low-income individuals being sentenced to death. Furthermore, there have been numerous cases of innocent people being sentenced to death and later exonerated, highlighting the fallibility of the criminal justice system and the possibility of executing innocent individuals.

Furthermore, capital punishment is costly, both financially and in terms of human resources. The appeals process in death penalty cases is often prolonged, and the cost of the trial, appeals and incarceration is significantly higher than for those sentenced to life imprisonment.

In conclusion, the use of capital punishment is a contentious issue, with strong opinions on both sides. While some argue that it serves as a deterrent and is a necessary punishment for heinous crimes such as murder, many argue that it is inhumane, has been shown to be ineffective as a deterrent, and that it is possible for innocent people to be wrongly convicted and executed. Additionally, capital punishment is costly, both financially and in terms of human resources. It's important to consider all of these",1
568,3001.a2.txt,"Sweden, just say No to the EU!","Sweden is a country located in Northern Europe, and it has been a member of the European Union (EU) since 1995. However, there is a growing movement in Sweden that advocates for the country to leave the EU, often referred to as ""Swexit."" This movement is based on the belief that leaving the EU would give Sweden more control over its own affairs and would be beneficial for the country's economy and sovereignty.

One of the main arguments for Sweden leaving the EU is that it would give the country more control over its own affairs. Supporters of Swexit argue that being a member of the EU limits Sweden's ability to make its own decisions and that leaving the EU would allow the country to regain its independence. They argue that the EU's decision-making process is slow, complex and that it's too influenced by larger member countries, and that Sweden's voice is not heard. Furthermore, they argue that the EU's regulations and laws are often not in line with Sweden's values and interests.

Another argument for Swexit is that it would be beneficial for Sweden's economy. Supporters of Swexit argue that the EU's regulations and laws are a burden on businesses and that leaving the EU would allow Sweden to negotiate its own trade deals and create its own economic policies. They argue that by leaving the EU, Sweden would be able to better control its own economy and would be able to create a more competitive and dynamic economy.

However, there are also valid arguments against Sweden leaving the EU. One of the main arguments against Swexit is that it would be detrimental to Sweden's economy. The EU is Sweden's largest trading partner and leaving the EU would likely lead to tariffs and other trade barriers that would make it more difficult for Swedish businesses to sell their goods and services in the EU. Additionally, the EU provides significant funding to Sweden for various projects, and leaving the EU would likely mean losing access to this funding.

Another argument against Swexit is that it would be detrimental to Sweden's security. The EU provides member countries with a common defense and security policy, which allows countries to work together to combat terrorism and other security threats. Additionally, the EU also provides member countries with access to intelligence-sharing and other security-related resources that are not available to non-member countries.

Furthermore, Swexit would also affect the social and cultural",1
569,3002.a2.txt,"What is on your plate, and why? - An essay about vegetarianism","Vegetarianism is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of meat, fish, and other animal products. People may choose to become vegetarians for a variety of reasons, including health, ethical, environmental, and spiritual concerns. In this essay, we will explore the reasons why an individual may choose to adopt a vegetarian diet, and the potential benefits and challenges of this lifestyle choice.

One of the main reasons why an individual may choose to become a vegetarian is for health reasons. A well-planned vegetarian diet can provide all the necessary nutrients for a healthy lifestyle, and may even offer some health benefits. A vegetarian diet is often high in fiber, antioxidants, and phytochemicals, which can help to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. Additionally, a vegetarian diet can help to lower cholesterol and blood pressure levels, which can help to reduce the risk of heart disease.

Another reason why an individual may choose to become a vegetarian is for ethical reasons. Many people choose to abstain from consuming animal products due to concerns about the treatment of animals in factory farms and the environmental impact of animal agriculture. They believe that it's morally wrong to kill animals for food, and that a plant-based diet is more sustainable and environmentally friendly.

Additionally, some people may choose to become vegetarians for spiritual or religious reasons. Many religious and spiritual traditions encourage non-violence and compassion for all living beings, which may lead some individuals to adopt a vegetarian diet as a way to align their food choices with their beliefs.

However, becoming a vegetarian can also pose some challenges. One of the main challenges is getting enough of certain nutrients that are typically found in animal products, such as protein, iron, vitamin B12, and omega-3 fatty acids. It's important for vegetarians to make sure they are getting enough of these nutrients through their diet or supplements. Additionally, it can be challenging for vegetarians to find suitable meal options when eating out or traveling, which can make it difficult to stick to a vegetarian diet.

Furthermore, some people may face social challenges when becoming a vegetarian. They may face criticism or pressure from friends and family who do not understand or support their decision to adopt a vegetarian lifestyle. Additionally, some individuals may experience negative reactions from others when eating in social situations, as some people may perceive vegetarians as being difficult or picky eaters.

In conclusion, vegetarianism is a personal choice that an individual may make for various reasons including health, ethical, environmental, and spiritual concerns. A vegetarian diet can provide many health benefits and can be an environmentally friendly choice. However, it's important for vegetarians to ensure they are getting enough of the necessary nutrients and to be prepared to face some challenges such as finding suitable meal options and facing criticism. Ultimately, it's important for individuals to make informed decisions about what they choose to put on their plate, considering their own personal beliefs,",1

It should be up to every woman to decide on an abortion or not without having other people interfere. Everybody's naturally entitled to his or her own opinion. I only have objections to people trying to force their views on others.,"Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy before the fetus is able to survive outside of the womb. The issue of abortion is a complex and highly debated topic, with strong opinions on both sides. Those who support the right to access abortion argue that it is a matter of women's reproductive rights and bodily autonomy. Those who are against abortion argue that it is morally and ethically wrong, and that it should be illegal.

One of the main arguments in favor of access to abortion is that it is a matter of women's reproductive rights and bodily autonomy. Supporters argue that women should have the right to make decisions about their own bodies, and that access to safe and legal abortion is necessary to protect women's health and well-being. They argue that criminalizing abortion would not stop it from happening, but rather would drive women to seek unsafe and illegal procedures, putting their lives at risk.

Another argument in favor of access to abortion is that it can help to reduce maternal deaths and injuries. In countries where abortion is illegal, women often resort to unsafe methods to terminate their pregnancies, which can lead to serious health complications and even death. Legalizing abortion and providing access to safe and legal procedures can help to reduce the number of maternal deaths and injuries.

On the other hand, those who are against abortion argue that it is morally and ethically wrong. They argue that the fetus has a right to life, and that abortion is the taking of an innocent life. They also argue that the fetus should be protected and that its right to life should be respected. Additionally, they argue that there are alternatives to abortion such as adoption, and that it's not necessary to end a pregnancy if a woman is not ready to have a child.

Furthermore, some argue that the availability of abortion can have negative effects on society, such as promoting promiscuity, devaluing human life and leading to a culture of death. Additionally, some religious groups consider abortion to be a sin and therefore, it goes against their belief system.

In conclusion, the issue of abortion is a complex and highly debated topic, with strong opinions on both sides. Those who support access to abortion argue that it is a matter of women's reproductive rights and bodily autonomy, and that it can help to reduce maternal deaths and injuries.

The question of who should be responsible for caring for the elderly is a contentious one, with some arguing that families should take on this responsibility, while others argue that the state should play a more active role.

One argument in favor of families caring for the elderly is that it is a natural part of family dynamics and that family members are often best equipped to understand and meet the needs of their loved ones. Families often have a long-standing relationship with their elderly members and can provide a sense of continuity and familiarity that may not be available in institutional settings. Additionally, family care can be more cost-effective as it eliminates the need for expensive professional care.

Another argument in favor of families caring for the elderly is that it can foster a sense of intergenerational connection and continuity. When elderly family members are cared for by their own family, it can create an opportunity for the elderly and their family members to build stronger relationships and for younger generations to learn about their family history. It can also promote the sense of community and belonging that is often lacking in institutional settings.

In many countries, compulsory education typically lasts between six and eight years, but some countries have extended this to twelve years. The idea of introducing compulsory education for future school principals is one that is gaining traction in many countries, as it aims to ensure that all school leaders have a strong foundation in education theory and practice.

One of the main arguments in favor of introducing compulsory education for future school principals is that it will ensure that all school leaders are well-trained and qualified. By requiring all future school principals to complete a certain level of education, it will ensure that they have a deep understanding of the latest educational theories and practices, as well as knowledge of the specific needs of their school and community. This will ensure that all school leaders are equipped to provide the best possible education for their students.

Another argument in favor of compulsory education for future school principals is that it will help to improve the overall quality of education. A well-trained and qualified school leader is essential for ensuring that the educational experience provided by the school is of the highest quality. By requiring all future school principals to complete a certain level of education, it will help to ensure that all schools have leaders who are capable of providing the best possible education for their students.

In addition, compulsory education for future school principals will also help to promote professional development, which is crucial for any profession to improve and evolve. The education will give them the knowledge and skills to be able to make informed decisions, to be able to lead and manage a school, and to be able to evaluate and improve the education provided by their school.

Furthermore, introducing compulsory education for future school principals will ensure that schools are led by individuals who are committed to education and have a deep understanding of the importance of education in shaping the future of their students and communities. It will ensure that school leaders have the necessary knowledge and skills to make effective decisions, to lead and manage a school, and to evaluate and improve the education provided by their school.

However, there are also valid arguments against introducing compulsory education for future school principals. One of the main arguments is that it could be costly, and it could be difficult to implement in practice. Additionally, it could also limit the pool of potential school leaders, as not everyone may be able or willing to complete the required education.

The question of whether the Swedish monarchy is a nice tradition worth keeping is a contentious one, with some arguing that it is an important part of Swedish history and culture, while others argue that it serves no practical purpose and is a waste of resources.

One argument in favor of keeping the Swedish monarchy is that it is an important part of Swedish history and culture. The monarchy has been a part of Swedish society for over a thousand years, and it has played an important role in shaping the country's history and identity. Additionally, the monarchy also serves as a symbol of continuity and stability, providing a sense of national unity and pride.

Another argument in favor of keeping the Swedish monarchy is that it plays an important ceremonial role in the country. The monarch conducts various ceremonial duties such as the opening of the parliament, and representing the country in official events and state visits. The monarchy also plays an important role in promoting cultural and social activities, the royal family is highly involved in various charitable causes, and their public appearances are often seen as promoting national unity and pride.

Furthermore, some argue that the Swedish monarchy is worth keeping because it brings in tourism and contributes to the economy. The royal palace, for example, is a popular tourist attraction, and events such as royal weddings and coronations can boost the economy by attracting visitors to the country.

On the other hand, some argue that the Swedish monarchy serves no practical purpose and is a waste of resources. They argue that the monarchy is outdated and that it serves no practical purpose in modern society. They also argue that the resources allocated to the monarchy, such as the cost of maintaining the royal palace and the cost of supporting the royal family, could be better used elsewhere.

Additionally, some argue that the Swedish monarchy is undemocratic, as the monarch is not elected but inherited, and that it should be abolished as it does not align with the democratic principles of the country.

Another reason why an individual may choose to become a vegetarian is for ethical reasons. Many people choose to abstain from consuming animal products due to concerns about the treatment of animals in factory farms and the environmental impact of animal agriculture. The process of factory farming is seen as inhumane and in many cases, animals are kept in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions, and are fed an unnatural diet, which can lead to health problems for the animals. In addition, many believe that it's morally wrong to kill animals for food, and that a plant-based diet is more sustainable and environmentally friendly. Meat production requires large amounts of water, land, and energy, and it generates significant greenhouse gas emissions. A vegetarian diet is seen as a more sustainable option in this regard.

Additionally, some people may choose to become vegetarians for spiritual or religious reasons. Many religious and spiritual traditions encourage non-violence and compassion for all living beings, which may lead some individuals to adopt a vegetarian diet as a way to align their food choices with their beliefs.

The idea of wearing a bicycle helmet 24 hours a day, with the purpose of saving our intergalactic reputation, is a unique perspective. It suggests that wearing a helmet could be seen as a symbol of responsibility and safety, not just for the individual but also for the reputation of humanity as a whole.

One argument in favor of wearing a bicycle helmet 24 hours a day is that it can serve as a symbol of responsibility and safety. Wearing a helmet at all times, even when not riding a bicycle, can send a message to others that the individual takes their safety seriously and is willing to take the necessary precautions to protect themselves and others. This message of responsibility and safety can extend beyond just the individual and can serve as a symbol for humanity as a whole, showing that we are a responsible and safety-conscious species.

Another argument in favor of wearing a bicycle helmet 24 hours a day is that it can protect against head injuries in unexpected situations. Accidents can happen at any time, and wearing a helmet at all times can provide protection in case of a fall or other unexpected event. This is especially relevant if one is traveling to other planets or intergalactic spaces, where the conditions may be different and accidents may happen at any time.

Additionally, wearing a bicycle helmet 24 hours a day can also serve as a reminder to be aware of one's surroundings and to be prepared for unexpected situations. It can serve as a constant reminder to be cautious and to be prepared for potential hazards, both on Earth and in the intergalactic space.

On the other hand, some may argue that wearing a bicycle helmet 24 hours a day is unnecessary and can be uncomfortable. They may argue that helmets are not needed in certain situations and that they can be restrictive and uncomfortable to wear. Additionally, some may argue that helmets can give a false sense of security and may encourage risky behavior.

Furthermore, some may argue that the idea of saving our intergalactic reputation is not a valid reason to wear a bicycle helmet 24 hours a day. They may argue that the reputation of humanity should not be based on whether or not individuals wear helmets and that there are more important issues to be addressed.

In conclusion, the idea of wearing a bicycle helmet 24 hours a day, with the purpose of saving our intergalactic reputation, is a unique perspective. It suggests that wearing a helmet could be seen as a symbol of responsibility and safety, not just for the individual but also for the reputation of humanity as a whole.

One argument in favor of school fee is that it helps to cover the costs of running the school. This includes costs such as teacher salaries, building maintenance, and educational materials. Additionally, the income from school fee can be used to improve the school's facilities and resources, which can benefit the students and enhance their learning experience.

Another argument in favor of school fee is that it promotes parental involvement and accountability. When parents are required to pay for their child's education, they are more likely to be engaged in their child's education and to take an active interest in their child's academic progress. This can lead to better communication between parents and teachers and can improve the overall quality of education for the students.

Moreover, some argue that school fee is justifiable because it allows for more equitable distribution of education resources. Schools that charge fees are able to use this income to provide a higher quality of education, which can benefit students from all backgrounds. This can help to ensure that all students have access to the same educational opportunities and can help to close the achievement gap between students from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

On the other hand, some argue that school fee is not justifiable. They argue that education is a fundamental right and that charging fees can be a barrier to education for low-income families. They argue that the government should provide free education to all students, regardless of their family's income.

Additionally, some argue that school fee is not justifiable because it can lead to social segregation. They argue that schools that charge fees are more likely to be attended by students from wealthier families, which can lead to social segregation and can exacerbate the achievement gap between students from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

Furthermore, there are some who argue that school fee is not justifiable because it can put a financial burden on the parents, who may already be struggling to make ends meet. This can lead to stress and financial difficulties for the families, which can have a negative impact on the children's education.

In conclusion, the issue of school fee is a contentious one, with valid arguments on both sides. Those who argue that school fee is justifiable point to the fact that it helps to cover the costs of running the school, promotes parental involvement and accountability and allows for",1
577,3033.a2.txt,Anna Lindh - out on a limb A member of parliament trying to impose regulations without public support or understanding,"Anna Lindh was a Swedish politician who served as the Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1998 until her death in 2003. She was a member of the Swedish Social Democratic Party and was known for her strong commitment to the European Union and her efforts to promote international cooperation.

One of the main criticisms of Anna Lindh's political career is that she was often ""out on a limb,"" meaning that she took positions on certain issues that were not widely supported by the public or her party. For example, Anna Lindh was a strong advocate for Sweden to join the Eurozone, which was a controversial issue at the time. Despite public opposition to the idea, she continued to push for it, arguing that it was in the best interest of the country.

Another example of Anna Lindh being ""out on a limb"" was her efforts to impose regulations on the Swedish arms trade. Despite facing strong opposition from the arms industry and some members of her own party, she pushed for stricter regulations on the export of weapons and ammunition. She argued that this was necessary to prevent arms from falling into the hands of human rights abusers and to promote peace and stability in the world.

Critics argue that Anna Lindh's actions were misguided, as she was trying to impose regulations without having the support or understanding of the public or her party. They argue that this lack of support and understanding made it difficult for her to achieve her goals and that her actions were not effective in promoting her desired outcomes.

Additionally, some argue that Anna Lindh's actions were not pragmatic and that her efforts to impose regulations without public support or understanding were a political miscalculation. They argue that it's important for a politician to have the support of the public and the party they represent, in order to be able to achieve their goals.

On the other hand, some argue that Anna Lindh's actions were admirable and that she should be praised for her willingness to take a stand on controversial issues, even when it was not popular. They argue that she was a strong leader who was not afraid to take bold actions, even when it was difficult.

In conclusion, Anna Lindh was a Swedish politician who was known for her strong commitment to the European Union and her efforts to promote international cooperation. However, her political career was marked by criticism, as she was often seen as ""out on a limb,"" meaning that she took positions on certain issues that were not widely supported by the public or her party. Her actions were seen as a political miscalculation by some, while others argue that she should be praised for her willingness to take a stand on controversial issues.",1
578,3035.a2.txt,TO RECEIVE THE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS MEANS TO DESERVE IT BY WORKING IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR,"Unemployment benefits are financial assistance provided to individuals who have lost their jobs and are actively seeking employment. The idea that to receive unemployment benefits one must deserve it by working in the public sector is a controversial one, with valid arguments on both sides.

One argument in favor of linking unemployment benefits to public sector work is that it encourages individuals to work in jobs that serve the public good. The public sector, which includes jobs such as teaching, healthcare, and public administration, plays a crucial role in providing essential services to communities. By linking unemployment benefits to public sector work, it can encourage individuals to choose careers in these fields, which can help to ensure that these essential services are adequately staffed.

Another argument in favor of linking unemployment benefits to public sector work is that it can promote social mobility. The public sector often provides jobs with more stable and secure employment, which can be beneficial for individuals from low-income backgrounds. This can help to increase social mobility, as it can provide these individuals with more opportunities to improve their economic situation.

Moreover, some argue that linking unemployment benefits to public sector work can reduce the burden on the government. Unemployment benefits are typically funded by the government, and by encouraging individuals to work in the public sector, it can reduce the number of individuals who are receiving unemployment benefits, which in turn can reduce the government's financial burden.

On the other hand, some argue that linking unemployment benefits to public sector work is unfair and unjust. They argue that individuals should not be forced to work in the public sector in order to receive unemployment benefits, as it limits their freedom of choice. Additionally, they argue that this policy can discriminate against individuals who may not be interested in working in the public sector or those who may not meet the qualifications for public sector jobs.

Furthermore, some argue that linking unemployment benefits to public sector work can discourage individuals from starting their own businesses or working in the private sector. This can have a negative impact on the economy, as it can limit the growth and development of the private sector.

In conclusion, the idea of linking unemployment benefits to public sector work is a controversial one, with valid arguments on both sides. Those who argue in favor of it suggest that it can encourage individuals to work in jobs that serve the public good, promote social mobility and reduce the burden on the government. On the other hand, some argue that it is unfair and unjust, limits freedom of choice, and can discourage individuals from starting their own businesses or working in the private sector. It's important to consider the potential implications of this policy before making a decision.",1
579,3036.a2.txt,NA,"Roleplaying is a form of entertainment where participants assume the roles of fictional characters and act out scenarios, often in the form of interactive storytelling or gaming. The idea that roleplaying teenagers can make people lose contact with reality is a controversial one, with valid arguments on both sides.

One argument against roleplaying as teenagers is that it can lead to a loss of touch with reality. When individuals assume the role of a teenager, they may become so immersed in the character and the fantasy world that they lose sight of the real world and the responsibilities they have in it. This can lead to a disconnection from reality, which can negatively impact their personal and professional lives. Additionally, this can also lead to difficulties in distinguishing fiction from reality and can cause confusion and misunderstandings.

Moreover, some argue that roleplaying teenagers can also encourage people to act in an immature or irresponsible manner. By assuming the role of a teenager, individuals may feel that they can act in ways that would be unacceptable in the real world, such as engaging in risky behavior or neglecting their responsibilities. This can lead to negative consequences, both in the roleplaying scenario and in their real lives.

Additionally, some argue that roleplaying teenagers can be harmful to those who are actually teenagers. It can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and can also trivialize the challenges that real teenagers face. This can lead to a lack of understanding and empathy for the experiences of actual teenagers and can also lead to harmful behavior towards them.

On the other hand, some argue that roleplaying as teenagers can be beneficial. They argue that it can be a way for individuals to explore different perspectives, gain empathy, and improve their creative problem-solving skills. Roleplaying can also be a way for people to learn about different cultures and social issues. Additionally, it can also be a healthy form of escapism, allowing people to temporarily step away from their real-world responsibilities and experience something different.

Furthermore, some argue that roleplaying can be a form of self-expression and can be a therapeutic tool for people to process and understand their own experiences. It can also be a way for people to gain a better understanding of how other people think and feel, which can be beneficial for personal and professional relationships.

In conclusion, the idea that roleplaying teenagers can make people lose contact with reality is a controversial one. It is important to consider the potential negative impacts such as losing touch with reality, encouraging immature or irresponsible behavior, and perpetuating harmful stereotypes. However, it is also important to consider the potential benefits, such as gaining empathy, improving problem-solving skills, and providing a form of escapism. As with any form of entertainment, it's important to engage in it in moderation and be aware of the potential effects on oneself and others.",1
580,3037.a2.txt,"Democracy, a delusion? A short critique of present-day liberalism","Democracy is a form of government in which power is held by the people, either directly or through elected representatives. The concept of democracy has been around for centuries, with ancient Greece often cited as the birthplace of democracy. In modern times, democracy has become the dominant form of government in the Western world, with many countries adopting democratic systems of governance.

However, despite its widespread acceptance, there are those who argue that democracy is a delusion. They argue that democracy is not an effective form of governance and that it can actually lead to negative outcomes. One of the main criticisms of democracy is that it can lead to mob rule, where the majority can trample on the rights of minorities. Additionally, democracy can be vulnerable to manipulation and manipulation by powerful interest groups, who can sway public opinion and influence the outcome of elections.

Another critique of democracy is that it can lead to a lack of accountability. In a democratic system, elected officials are accountable to the people, but this accountability can be weak if the people are not well-informed or if they do not participate in the democratic process. Additionally, democracy can be undermined by political polarization, where politicians and citizens become entrenched in their beliefs and unwilling to compromise or consider alternative perspectives.

In present-day liberalism, it has been argued that democracy has been distorted by the influence of neoliberalism. Neoliberalism is an economic philosophy that emphasizes the importance of free markets and minimal government intervention. This philosophy has been adopted by many politicians and policymakers in recent decades, and it has been criticized for leading to increased income inequality and a lack of government support for the poor and working class. Additionally, neoliberalism has been criticized for promoting a culture of individualism, where people are encouraged to look out for themselves rather than working together for the common good.

In conclusion, democracy is a form of government that has been widely adopted in the Western world, but it is not without its flaws. It can lead to mob rule, manipulation by powerful interest groups, lack of accountability, and political polarization. In present-day, democracy has been distorted by the influence of neoliberalism which is promoting a culture of individualism, leading to increased income inequality and lack of government support for the poor and working class. However, it is important to note that democracy is still a work in progress and there is always room for improvement. It is the duty of citizens to actively participate in the democratic process and hold their elected officials accountable to ensure that democracy is functioning as it should.",1
581,3040.a2.txt,Abortion - a question of human freedom,"Abortion is a highly controversial and divisive issue that has been at the forefront of political and moral debates for decades. At its core, the debate over abortion centers on the question of whether a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body and whether the fetus is a separate human being with its own rights.

On one hand, those who are pro-choice argue that a woman should have the freedom to make her own choices about her body, including the decision to have an abortion. They argue that a woman has a right to privacy and autonomy and that the government should not be able to interfere in personal decisions about pregnancy and childbirth. Additionally, pro-choice advocates argue that access to safe and legal abortion is essential for women's health and that criminalizing abortion would lead to dangerous and unsafe back-alley abortions.

On the other hand, those who are pro-life argue that the fetus is a separate human being with its own rights and that abortion is morally wrong because it ends the life of an innocent unborn child. They argue that the government has a duty to protect the rights of the unborn and that abortion is a form of murder. Additionally, pro-life advocates argue that there are alternatives to abortion, such as adoption, and that women should be offered support and resources to help them carry their pregnancy to term.

Both sides of the debate have valid points and there are valid arguments on both sides. However, it is important to recognize that the question of abortion is not only a question of human freedom, but also a question of human rights.

When it comes to the question of human freedom, it is clear that a woman should have the right to make her own choices about her body and her pregnancy. The right to privacy and autonomy is a fundamental human right, and the government should not be able to interfere in personal decisions about pregnancy and childbirth. Additionally, access to safe and legal abortion is essential for women's health and well-being, and criminalizing abortion would lead to dangerous and unsafe back-alley abortions.

However, it is also important to recognize that the question of abortion is also a question of human rights. The fetus is a separate human being with its own rights and it is important to consider the rights of the unborn when making decisions about abortion. Additionally, there are alternatives to abortion, such as adoption, and women should be offered support and resources to help them carry their pregnancy to term.

In conclusion, the question of abortion is a complex and nuanced one that involves a balance between the rights of the mother and the rights of the unborn. It is important for society to find a way to respect the rights and autonomy of women while also protecting the rights and lives of the unborn. This can be achieved through providing access to safe and legal abortion, as well as offering support and resources to women who choose to carry their pregnancy to term. Ultimately, it is a question of human freedom and human rights, and finding a way to balance these two important values is crucial for a just and compassionate society.",1
582,3041.a2.txt,Petrol- and diesel prices,"Petrol and diesel prices are a contentious issue that affects people all over the world. The prices of these fossil fuels can have a significant impact on the economy, the environment, and people's daily lives. In this essay, I will discuss the factors that influence petrol and diesel prices, the effects of high fuel prices on the economy, and the potential solutions to this problem.

One of the main factors that influence petrol and diesel prices is the cost of crude oil. Crude oil is the raw material that is used to make petrol and diesel, and the price of crude oil is determined by a variety of factors such as supply and demand, geopolitical events, and natural disasters. When the price of crude oil goes up, so do the prices of petrol and diesel.

Another factor that affects fuel prices is taxes. Governments around the world impose taxes on petrol and diesel to generate revenue and to encourage conservation. These taxes can vary widely from country to country, and can have a significant impact on fuel prices. Additionally, the cost of refining and distributing fuel also contributes to the price at the pump.

High fuel prices can have a significant impact on the economy. When fuel prices are high, it can lead to inflation, as the cost of goods and services increases due to the higher cost of transportation. High fuel prices can also affect consumer spending, as people have less disposable income to spend on other goods and services. Additionally, high fuel prices can have a negative effect on small businesses, as they often rely on transportation to move goods and services.

Another major impact of high fuel prices is on the environment. The burning of fossil fuels is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. High fuel prices can encourage people to use less fuel and adopt more sustainable transportation methods, such as electric cars or public transportation, which can help to reduce emissions.

So what are the potential solutions to high fuel prices? One solution is to increase the use of alternative fuels such as electric vehicles, hydrogen, and biofuels. These alternative fuels can help to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and can help to stabilize fuel prices in the long term. Additionally, governments can implement policies to encourage the use of alternative fuels, such as tax incentives or subsidies.

Another solution is to increase the efficiency of transportation. By improving the fuel efficiency of cars, trucks and other vehicles, we can reduce the amount of fuel that is consumed and therefore help to lower fuel prices. Additionally, governments can invest in public transportation infrastructure, which can help to reduce the need for people to rely on their own cars.

In conclusion, petrol and diesel prices are a complex issue that affects people all over the world. The prices of these fossil fuels are influenced by a variety of factors, including the cost of crude oil, taxes, and refining and distribution costs. High fuel prices can have a significant impact on the economy and the environment, and there are potential solutions to this problem such as alternative fuels, and increasing efficiency of transportation. It is important for governments and individuals to consider these factors and take action to help to stabilize fuel prices and protect the environment.",1
583,3042.a2.txt,VISUALLY IMPAIRED PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO GO TO MAIN STREAM SCHOOLS,"Visually impaired individuals face many challenges in their daily lives, and one of the most significant is their right to access mainstream education. Visually impaired students have the right to receive an education that is equal to that of their sighted peers, and this includes the right to attend mainstream schools. However, in many cases, visually impaired students are placed in special education programs or segregated schools, which can limit their opportunities and access to a quality education.

One of the main reasons that visually impaired students are placed in special education programs or segregated schools is because of the lack of accommodations and resources in mainstream schools. Many mainstream schools are not equipped to handle the needs of visually impaired students, and this can lead to a lack of access to appropriate assistive technology, braille materials, and qualified teachers and staff. Additionally, there is often a lack of understanding and awareness among mainstream school staff and other students about the needs of visually impaired students, which can lead to discrimination and isolation.

However, it is important to note that mainstream schools can provide a valuable educational experience for visually impaired students. By attending mainstream schools, visually impaired students have the opportunity to interact with their sighted peers and learn from them. This can be beneficial for their social and emotional development, as well as their academic progress. Additionally, mainstream schools have more resources and opportunities available to students, such as extracurricular activities, clubs, and sports teams.

To ensure that visually impaired students have access to mainstream education, governments and schools must take steps to make mainstream schools more inclusive and accommodating to visually impaired students. This can include providing appropriate accommodations such as assistive technology, braille materials, and qualified teachers and staff. It also means to educate the staff, teachers and students on the needs of visually impaired students and raise awareness about visual impairments and ways to support them.

Another important step is to ensure that visually impaired students have access to the same curriculum as their sighted peers. This can be achieved by providing braille materials, audio recordings, and other alternative formats of the curriculum. Additionally, teachers must be trained to provide instruction that is accessible to visually impaired students, and they must be able to adapt their teaching methods to meet the needs of visually impaired students.

In conclusion, visually impaired students have the right to access mainstream education, and this includes the right to attend mainstream schools. However, many mainstream schools are not equipped to handle the needs of visually impaired students, and this can lead to a lack of access to appropriate accommodations and resources. To ensure that visually impaired students have access to mainstream education, governments and schools must take steps to make mainstream schools more inclusive and accommodating to visually impaired students. This includes providing appropriate accommodations, educating staff and students on the needs of visually impaired students, and ensuring that visually impaired students have access to the same curriculum as their sighted peers.

584,3044.a2.txt,Swedish benefits from a membership in EMU.,"Sweden's decision to remain outside the European Monetary Union (EMU) has been a topic of much debate. While some argue that staying out of the EMU has allowed Sweden to maintain more control over its monetary policy, others argue that there are benefits to joining the EMU. In this essay, I will discuss some of the potential benefits that Sweden could gain from a membership in the EMU.

One of the main benefits of joining the EMU is increased economic stability. As a member of the EMU, Sweden would be part of a monetary union with a common currency, the Euro. This would eliminate the risk of currency fluctuations, which can have a significant impact on the economy. By eliminating currency fluctuations, the EMU would provide a stable environment for businesses, investors, and consumers, which would lead to increased economic growth and job creation.

Another benefit of joining the EMU is increased trade and investment. The EMU would create a larger and more integrated market, which would make it easier for Swedish businesses to trade and invest within the EU. This would lead to increased economic growth and job creation, as well as increased competition, which would drive innovation and productivity. Additionally, the EMU would provide a larger market for Swedish goods and services, which would increase exports and help to create jobs.

A membership in the EMU would also increase Sweden's influence in the EU. As a member of the EMU, Sweden would have a greater say in the EU's monetary policy and would be able to shape the direction of the EU's economic policy. This would give Sweden a greater voice in the EU and would help to ensure that its interests are taken into account.

In addition, the EMU would also provide a platform for Sweden to coordinate its economic policies with other EU member states. This could lead to a more efficient use of resources and could help to stabilize the economy in times of crisis.

However, it is also important to note that there are also potential downsides to joining the EMU. One potential downside is the loss of control over monetary policy. As a member of the EMU, Sweden would have to give up its own central bank and would have to adopt the policies of the European Central Bank (ECB). This could lead to a loss of flexibility in monetary policy and could make it more difficult for Sweden to respond to economic shocks.

Another potential downside is the risk of increased inflation. As a member of the EMU, Sweden would be part of a monetary union with a common inflation rate. This could lead to higher inflation in Sweden, which could hurt consumers and businesses.

In conclusion, while there are potential downsides to joining the EMU, there are also many benefits that Sweden could gain from a membership in the EMU. These benefits include increased economic stability, increased trade and investment, increased influence in the EU, and a platform for coordinating economic policies with other EU member states. Overall, a membership in the EMU would provide many benefits to Sweden and it would help to ensure that it is able to compete and thrive in the global economy.",1
585,3045.a2.txt,NA,"In recent years, there has been a growing concern about obesity in Sweden, as the country has seen a significant increase in the number of overweight and obese individuals. This trend is not unique to Sweden, as many other developed countries have also seen a rise in obesity rates. However, the issue is particularly concerning in Sweden as it has long been known for its healthy lifestyle and high standard of living. In this essay, I will discuss the factors contributing to this trend and the potential solutions to address the problem of obesity in Sweden.

One of the main factors contributing to the rise in obesity in Sweden is the changing diet. The Swedish diet has traditionally been known for its healthy and balanced approach, with a focus on fresh fruits, vegetables, and lean meats. However, in recent years, there has been a shift towards processed and high-calorie foods, which has led to an increase in the consumption of added sugars and saturated fats. This change in diet, coupled with a lack of physical activity, has led to an increase in the number of overweight and obese individuals in Sweden.

Another contributing factor to the rise in obesity in Sweden is the increasing sedentary lifestyle. With the rise of technology and the internet, more and more people are spending their time sitting in front of screens, whether it is at work or at home. This lack of physical activity has led to a decrease in energy expenditure, which has contributed to the rise in obesity rates.

The trend of obesity in Sweden also has an economic aspect. The availability and access to healthy food options can be limited in certain areas and neighborhoods, particularly in low-income areas. This can contribute to the development of food deserts, where residents have limited access to supermarkets and grocery stores that sell fresh fruits and vegetables. This can make it more difficult for residents to maintain a healthy diet, leading to a higher risk of obesity.

The rise in obesity in Sweden has significant health implications. Overweight and obesity increase the risk of a wide range of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. These diseases not only have a negative impact on an individual's health but also places a strain on the healthcare system.

To address the problem of obesity in Sweden, there is a need for a comprehensive approach that addresses both the individual and societal factors that contribute to the trend. One solution is to promote a healthy diet and physical activity. This can be achieved by educating the public about the benefits of a balanced diet and regular exercise, as well as providing incentives for healthy behaviors. Additionally, there is a need for policies and regulations that promote the availability of healthy food options and limit the availability of unhealthy foods, particularly in low-income areas.

Another solution is to encourage companies and employers to promote healthy lifestyles among their employees. This can be achieved by providing access to gym facilities and promoting healthy eating options in the workplace. Additionally, employers can provide incentives for employees who engage in healthy behaviors, such as offering discounts on health insurance premiums.

In conclusion, the rising trend of obesity in Sweden is a complex issue that has many contributing factors. These factors include a changing diet, a sedentary lifestyle, and limited access to healthy food options. To address this problem, there is a need for a comprehensive approach that addresses both the individual and societal factors that contribute to the trend. This can be achieved through promoting a healthy diet and physical activity, encouraging companies and employers to promote healthy lifestyles among their employees, and promoting policies and regulations that promote the availability of healthy food options and limit the availability of unhealthy foods. By working together, we can help to reverse the trend of obesity in Sweden and ensure that the country maintains its reputation for a healthy lifestyle and high standard of living.",1
586,3062.a2.txt,Can we trust the statistics?,"Statistics are used in a variety of fields, from science and economics to politics and healthcare. They are used to make decisions, guide policy, and inform the public. However, as statistics are often used to make important decisions, it is crucial to ask the question: can we trust the statistics?

The answer to this question is not a simple one as it depends on various factors such as the source of the statistics, the methods used to collect and analyze the data, and the context in which the statistics are presented.

One of the key factors that determine the trustworthiness of statistics is the source of the data. Statistics from reputable and unbiased sources, such as government agencies or academic institutions, are generally considered more reliable than statistics from sources with a vested interest in the outcome. For example, statistics on crime rates from a government agency are likely to be more reliable than statistics from a private security company.

Another factor that determines the trustworthiness of statistics is the methods used to collect and analyze the data. Statistics that are based on a large and representative sample, collected using unbiased methods, and analyzed using appropriate statistical techniques are generally considered more reliable than statistics that are based on a small and non-representative sample, collected using biased methods, and analyzed using inappropriate statistical techniques.

Additionally, the context in which statistics are presented can also affect their trustworthiness. Statistics can be manipulated or misinterpreted to support a particular agenda or viewpoint. For example, statistics on crime rates may be presented in a way that exaggerates the problem in order to justify a particular policy or to appeal to a particular political base.

In order to determine whether we can trust the statistics, it is important to critically evaluate the source, methods, and context of the statistics. This involves asking questions such as: Who collected the data? How was the data collected? What is the sample size and how representative is it? How were the data analyzed? How were the results presented?

However, it is important to note that even statistics from reputable sources, collected using appropriate methods, and presented in an unbiased context can still be subject to errors and uncertainty. Therefore, it is also important to consider the level of precision and confidence in the statistics.

In conclusion, the trustworthiness of statistics depends on various factors such as the source of the data, the methods used to collect and analyze the data, and the context in which the statistics are presented. While statistics from reputable sources, collected using appropriate methods, and presented in an unbiased context are generally considered more reliable, it is important to critically evaluate the statistics and consider the level of precision and confidence. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to use critical thinking and evaluate the statistics in order to make informed decisions.",1
587,3063.a2.txt,The Swedish purchase of Gripen fighter planes.,"The Swedish purchase of Gripen fighter planes has been a topic of much debate in the country. The Gripen is a multirole fighter aircraft developed by Saab, a Swedish aerospace and defense company. The aircraft is designed for air-to-air and air-to-ground missions and is considered one of the most advanced and versatile fighter planes in the world.

The Swedish government has been investing in the Gripen fighter planes for several decades, with the intention of modernizing and strengthening the country's air defense capabilities. The purchase of the Gripen fighter planes has been viewed as a strategic investment in the country's national security, as well as an opportunity to support the Swedish aerospace industry.

One of the main arguments in favor of the purchase of the Gripen fighter planes is the enhancement of Sweden's air defense capabilities. The Gripen is considered a highly advanced and versatile aircraft, capable of performing a wide range of missions, including air-to-air and air-to-ground operations. This means that the Gripen can be used to protect Sweden's airspace and to conduct reconnaissance, surveillance, and strike missions. Additionally, the Gripen can also be used to support ground troops and naval forces, providing a valuable tool for joint operations.

Another argument in favor of the purchase of the Gripen fighter planes is the support for the Swedish aerospace industry. The Gripen is a product of the Swedish aerospace industry, developed and manufactured by Saab, a leading company in the field. The purchase of the Gripen fighter planes would not only support the aerospace industry but also the wider economy by creating jobs and supporting innovation.

However, there are also arguments against the purchase of the Gripen fighter planes. One of the main criticisms is the cost of the project. The purchase of the Gripen fighter planes is a large investment for the Swedish government, and there are concerns that the cost of the project may divert resources away from other important areas such as healthcare, education, and social services.

Another criticism is that the purchase of the Gripen fighter planes may not be necessary for Sweden's defense needs. Some argue that Sweden's air defense capabilities are already strong, and that the purchase of the Gripen fighter planes is not necessary for the country's security. Additionally, there are concerns that the Gripen may not be able to effectively defend Sweden against more advanced threats, such as stealth aircraft or cruise missiles.

In conclusion, the Swedish purchase of Gripen fighter planes has been a topic of much debate in the country. The purchase of the Gripen fighter planes is viewed by some as a strategic investment in Sweden's national security and an opportunity to support the Swedish aerospace industry. However, others argue that the cost of the project may divert resources away from other important areas and that the purchase may not be necessary for Sweden's defense needs.

588,3064.a2.txt,Gay parents are as good as any parents!,"The idea that gay parents are not as good as any other parents has been a topic of much debate and controversy. However, research and studies have shown that children of gay parents fare just as well as children of straight parents in terms of their development, wellbeing, and happiness. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons why gay parents are just as good as any other parents.

First and foremost, the sexual orientation of a parent has no bearing on their ability to raise a child. What matters most is the love, care, and support that a parent provides to their child. Research has shown that children of gay parents have the same levels of emotional and psychological well-being as children of straight parents. Studies have also found that children of gay parents have the same level of social and cognitive development, and are just as likely to do well in school and have successful careers.

Secondly, children raised by gay parents are exposed to diverse and accepting environments. Children who grow up in households with gay parents learn from an early age that there are many different types of families, and that love and commitment are what make a family. This can help children to be more accepting and open-minded towards others, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Additionally, children of gay parents can also benefit from having both motherly and fatherly role models. Studies have found that children of gay parents are just as likely to have positive relationships with both parents and to have strong gender identities. Even if the child may not have a traditional family structure, they can still have positive and loving relationships with their parents, grandparents, and other relatives.

Moreover, children of gay parents are also more likely to have open-minded attitudes towards others and to be more accepting of diversity and differences. Growing up in a family where their parents are not judged for their sexual orientation can help children to be more accepting and understanding of others.

However, it is important to note that the quality of parenting is not solely determined by the sexual orientation of the parents but also by other factors such as the quality of the relationship between the parents and the child, the availability of resources, and the level of support from extended family and community.

In conclusion, gay parents are just as good as any other parents. Research and studies have shown that children of gay parents fare just as well as children of straight parents in terms of their development, wellbeing, and happiness. What matters most is the love, care, and support that a parent provides to their child. Additionally, children of gay parents are exposed to diverse and accepting environments, have the opportunity to have both motherly and fatherly role models, and are more likely to have open-minded attitudes towards others and to be more accepting of diversity and differences. Society should focus on the quality of parenting, not the sexual orientation of the parents.",1
589,3065.a2.txt,The Government should have a responsibility when it comes to the health of children and teenagers!,"The health and well-being of children and teenagers is of the utmost importance, as it not only affects their current quality of life but also their future prospects. The government plays a crucial role in ensuring that children and teenagers have access to the resources and support they need to maintain good health. In this essay, I will argue that the government has a responsibility to take action to improve the health of children and teenagers.

Firstly, the government has a responsibility to ensure that children and teenagers have access to affordable and quality healthcare. This includes providing access to preventive care, such as vaccinations and check-ups, as well as providing access to medical treatment when needed. The government should also ensure that children and teenagers have access to mental health services, as mental health is just as important as physical health.

Secondly, the government has a responsibility to promote healthy lifestyles for children and teenagers. This includes providing access to nutritious food, encouraging physical activity, and promoting healthy habits such as not smoking and not drinking alcohol. The government should also take steps to address the root causes of unhealthy lifestyles, such as poverty and lack of access to resources.

Thirdly, the government has a responsibility to ensure that children and teenagers have access to education and information about health. This includes providing sex education, which can help to prevent unwanted pregnancies and the spread of sexually transmitted infections. Additionally, the government should provide education and information about mental health, so that children and teenagers can learn how to take care of their mental well-being.

Moreover, the government has a responsibility to address the social determinants of health that affect children and teenagers. Social determinants of health refer to the environmental, economic, and social factors that influence health outcomes. These factors can include poverty, lack of access to education, and lack of access to safe and affordable housing. By addressing these underlying issues, the government can help to improve the health outcomes of children and teenagers.

However, it is important to note that improving the health of children and teenagers is not solely the responsibility of the government. Parents, educators, healthcare professionals, and the community also play an important role in promoting the health and well-being of children and teenagers.

In conclusion, the government has a responsibility to take action to improve the health of children and teenagers. This includes ensuring access to affordable and quality healthcare, promoting healthy lifestyles, providing education and information about health, and addressing the social determinants of health. By taking action to improve the health of children and teenagers, the government can help to ensure that children and teenagers have the resources and support they need to maintain good health, which in turn will lead to a better future for them.",1
590,3067.a2.txt,The West is responsible for environmental damage in developing countries,"The environment is a global concern and the negative impact of human activity on the environment is a well-documented fact. Developing countries have been particularly affected by environmental damage, due in large part to the actions of developed countries, particularly those in the West. In this essay, I will argue that the West is responsible for environmental damage in developing countries, and the reasons why this is the case.

Firstly, the West has a historical responsibility for environmental damage in developing countries. The industrial revolution, which began in the West, led to the widespread use of fossil fuels and the emergence of heavy industry, which has been a major contributor to environmental damage. The West has been responsible for a disproportionate amount of greenhouse gas emissions, which has led to global warming and climate change, and disproportionately affects developing countries.

Secondly, the West has a responsibility for environmental damage in developing countries due to their consumption patterns. Developed countries, particularly those in the West, have a high standard of living and consume a disproportionate amount of resources, such as energy and water. This has led to the exploitation of natural resources in developing countries, leading to environmental damage and degradation. Additionally, developed countries often export their waste and pollution to developing countries, which has a negative impact on the environment.

Thirdly, the West has a responsibility for environmental damage in developing countries due to their economic policies and practices. Developed countries, particularly those in the West, have a strong influence on the global economy and often impose economic policies and practices that have negative consequences for the environment in developing countries. For example, the promotion of a development model based on the extraction of natural resources and industrialization, without adequate environmental protections, can lead to environmental damage and degradation.

Moreover, the West has a responsibility for environmental damage in developing countries due to the lack of proper regulations and enforcement. Developed countries, particularly those in the West, have advanced environmental regulations, but often fail to enforce them or even provide support for developing countries to implement similar regulations. Additionally, the lack of proper regulations in developing countries allows multinational corporations to exploit natural resources without being held accountable for the environmental damage they cause.

However, it is important to note that the responsibility for environmental damage in developing countries is not solely the responsibility of the West. Developing countries also have a responsibility to take actions to protect their environment and to hold those within their own borders accountable for environmental damage. Additionally, the international community as a whole should work together to address environmental issues and to find sustainable solutions.

In conclusion, the West is responsible for environmental damage in developing countries. The West has a historical responsibility for environmental damage due to the industrial revolution, a responsibility for environmental damage due to their consumption patterns, a responsibility for environmental damage due to their economic policies and practices, and a responsibility for environmental damage due to the lack of proper regulations and enforcement. It is important for the West to take responsibility for their actions and to work with developing countries to find sustainable solutions to environmental issues.",1
591,3068.a2.txt,Legal age for buying alcohol should be 18,"The legal age for buying alcohol is a topic that has been widely debated and is determined by each country or state. The current legal drinking age in most countries is 18, but some countries have set it at 21. In this essay, I will argue that the legal age for buying alcohol should be 18.

Firstly, 18 is considered the age of majority in most countries and is the age at which individuals are legally considered adults. At this age, individuals are legally able to vote, marry, and join the military. It is reasonable to assume that individuals who are considered adults in these areas should also be considered adults when it comes to making decisions about alcohol consumption.

Secondly, setting the legal age for buying alcohol at 18 acknowledges that young adults are capable of making informed decisions about alcohol consumption. It is important to recognize that many 18-year-olds are in college or have entered the workforce and are capable of handling the responsibilities that come with drinking alcohol. Furthermore, setting the legal age at 18 encourages young adults to learn about responsible drinking before they reach the age of 21, when they may be more likely to engage in risky behavior.

Thirdly, setting the legal age for buying alcohol at 18 would also help to reduce the incidence of binge drinking and alcohol-related harm among young people. Research has shown that when the legal drinking age is set at 21, young people are more likely to engage in binge drinking and other dangerous drinking behaviors. By lowering the legal drinking age to 18, young people would be more likely to drink in a responsible manner and to be less likely to engage in binge drinking and other dangerous drinking behaviors.

Moreover, setting the legal age for buying alcohol at 18 would also help to reduce the number of alcohol-related deaths among young people. Lowering the legal drinking age would make it less likely for young people to obtain alcohol illegally and would reduce the number of alcohol-related accidents and deaths among young people.

However, it is important to note that setting the legal age for buying alcohol at 18 does not mean that there should be no restrictions on alcohol consumption for young people. It is important for parents, educators, and the community to educate young people about the risks associated with alcohol consumption and to encourage responsible drinking.

In conclusion, the legal age for buying alcohol should be 18. 18 is considered the age of majority in most countries, young adults are capable of making informed decisions about alcohol consumption, setting the legal age at 18 would help to reduce the incidence of binge drinking and alcohol-related harm among young people, and would reduce the number of alcohol-related deaths among young people. However, it's important to educate young people about the risks associated with alcohol consumption and to encourage responsible drinking.",1
592,3072.a2.txt,Learning English at the Age of Six,"Learning a second language at a young age has been shown to have many benefits for children, both academically and personally. In this essay, I will argue that it is beneficial for children to begin learning English at the age of six.

Firstly, beginning to learn English at the age of six allows children to acquire the language at a natural and effortless pace. Children have a unique ability to absorb new languages, known as the ""critical period"" for language acquisition, which is between birth and puberty. This period allows children to learn a language with less accent, fewer grammar errors, and greater ease compared to adults. Therefore, starting to learn English at age six allows children to take advantage of this critical period and become fluent in the language.

Secondly, learning English at a young age can have a positive impact on children's academic performance. English is widely considered as the global language of business, science, and technology, and a strong command of the language opens up many opportunities for children in terms of education and career prospects. Additionally, being bilingual or multilingual can improve cognitive development and problem-solving skills, as well as increase cultural awareness and understanding.

Thirdly, learning English at the age of six can help children develop greater social and communication skills. English is widely spoken and understood around the world, and being able to speak the language can open up many opportunities for children to communicate and connect with people from different cultures. Additionally, learning English at a young age can help children to become more confident and self-assured when communicating in the language, which will be beneficial for them in their personal and professional life.

Moreover, learning English at the age of six can be fun and engaging for children. Children are naturally curious and eager to learn, and teaching English to them in an interactive and stimulating way can make the learning process enjoyable for them. By using games, songs, and other interactive activities, children can learn the language in a fun and engaging way.

However, it's important to keep in mind that the optimal age for children to start learning English may vary from one child to another. Factors such as aptitude, the level of the parents' proficiency in the language, and the child's exposure to the language can influence the child's ability to learn English.

In conclusion, starting to learn English at the age of six has many benefits for children. Children at this age are in a critical period of language acquisition, and starting to learn English at this time allows them to acquire the language at a natural and effortless pace. Furthermore, learning English at a young age can have a positive impact on children's academic performance, social and communication skills, and make the learning process enjoyable. However, it's important to keep in mind that the optimal age for children to start learning English may vary, and it's important to consider the child's aptitude, level of the parents' proficiency in the language, and the child's exposure to the language.",1
593,4001.a2.txt,Abortion - a crime?,"Abortion has been a contentious issue for many years, with different societies and cultures having varying views on the matter. Some consider it a crime and others see it as a woman's right to choose. In this essay, I will examine the argument that abortion is a crime, and the reasons why some people believe this to be the case.

Firstly, some people argue that abortion is a crime because it is the taking of innocent human life. They argue that from the moment of conception, the fetus is a human being with the same rights as any other person. Therefore, terminating a pregnancy would be the same as taking a life, and should be considered a crime.

Secondly, some people argue that abortion is a crime because it is morally wrong. They argue that abortion goes against the moral principles and values of many societies and cultures. They believe that abortion is a violation of the sanctity of human life, and that it is morally wrong to end the life of an innocent unborn child.

Thirdly, some people argue that abortion is a crime because it is not necessary in most cases. They argue that in most cases, there are alternatives to abortion, such as adoption or keeping the child, and that women should not resort to abortion as a first choice. Additionally, they argue that there are many resources and support available for women who are facing unplanned pregnancies, and that abortion is not a necessary solution.

Moreover, some people argue that abortion is a crime because it can cause long-term emotional and psychological harm to women. They argue that many women experience feelings of guilt, shame, and regret after having an abortion, which can have a negative impact on their mental health. Furthermore, they argue that women should be provided with accurate information about the possible physical and psychological risks of abortion before making a decision.

However, it's important to note that the issue of abortion is complex and multifaceted. People have different opinions and beliefs about when life begins, and what rights a fetus has. Additionally, the decision to have an abortion is a personal one, and should be respected as such. Furthermore, there are many situations in which women may choose to have an abortion, such as in cases of rape or incest, fetal anomalies, or when the pregnancy poses a risk to the life or health of the mother.

In conclusion, the argument that abortion is a crime is based on the belief that it is the taking of innocent human life, morally wrong, not necessary, and can cause long-term emotional and psychological harm to women. However, the issue of abortion is complex and multifaceted and the decision should be respected as a personal one. Additionally, there are many situations in which women may choose to have an abortion, such as in cases of rape or incest, fetal anomalies, or when the pregnancy poses a risk to the life or health of the mother. It's important to keep in mind that the legal and moral implications of abortion are different and should be treated as such.",1
594,4002.a2.txt,Raise the teachers' salaries!,"Teachers play a crucial role in shaping the future of our society by educating and nurturing the minds of our children. However, despite the importance of their work, many teachers are not compensated fairly for their efforts. In this essay, I will argue that raising teachers' salaries is essential for the betterment of our education system and the future of our society.

Firstly, raising teachers' salaries is necessary to attract and retain high-quality teachers. Teaching is a demanding and challenging profession, and many highly qualified individuals are deterred from pursuing a career in teaching due to low pay. By raising teachers' salaries, we can attract and retain the best and brightest educators, which will lead to an improvement in the quality of education for our children.

Secondly, raising teachers' salaries is necessary to reduce teacher turnover. High turnover rates among teachers can have a negative impact on students' learning and academic performance. By raising teachers' salaries, we can reduce turnover rates and provide students with more stable and consistent educational experiences.

Thirdly, raising teachers' salaries is necessary to address the issue of teacher shortages. In many areas, there are not enough qualified teachers to meet the demand, which can lead to overcrowded classrooms and a lack of individualized attention for students. By raising teachers' salaries, we can attract more individuals to the teaching profession, and alleviate teacher shortages.

Moreover, raising teachers' salaries is necessary to improve the overall morale and job satisfaction of teachers. Teachers often work long hours and have heavy workloads, and low pay can lead to feelings of dissatisfaction and burnout. By raising teachers' salaries, we can improve the overall job satisfaction of teachers, which will lead to a more positive and productive work environment for teachers and students alike.

However, it's important to note that raising teachers' salaries is not the only solution to improving the education system. Additional resources, support, and training are also essential to improve the quality of education. Additionally, there are also other factors such as class sizes and funding that can impact the quality of education, and should be addressed as well.

In conclusion, raising teachers' salaries is essential for the betterment of our education system and the future of our society. It is necessary to attract and retain high-quality teachers, reduce teacher turnover, address teacher shortages, and improve the overall morale and job satisfaction of teachers. It's important to keep in mind that raising teachers' salaries is not the only solution to improving the education system, but it's an important step towards the betterment of the education system. Investing in teachers by providing them with fair compensation for their work is investing in the future of our society.",1
595,4003.a2.txt,Why the paragraph that regulates the right to claim for damages ought to be revised,"The right to claim for damages is a fundamental aspect of any legal system. It allows individuals and businesses to seek compensation for losses that they have incurred as a result of the actions of others. However, the current regulations surrounding the right to claim for damages are often complex and difficult to navigate, making it difficult for individuals and businesses to seek the compensation that they are entitled to. This is why the paragraph that regulates the right to claim for damages ought to be revised.

One of the main issues with the current regulations is that they are often overly complicated and difficult to understand. This can make it difficult for individuals and businesses to know when they are entitled to seek compensation, and can also make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system in order to do so. This can be particularly problematic for individuals and businesses that are not familiar with the legal system, as they may be intimidated by the process and may not know where to turn for help.

Another issue with the current regulations is that they can be overly restrictive. For example, there may be strict deadlines for filing claims, or there may be limits on the types of losses that can be claimed for. This can make it difficult for individuals and businesses to seek the compensation that they are entitled to, even if they are able to navigate the legal system.

In addition, the current regulations can be unfair in some cases. For example, some individuals and businesses may be able to seek large sums of money in damages, while others may be limited to smaller amounts. This can create a sense of injustice, and can lead to resentment among those who feel that they have been treated unfairly.

In order to address these issues, the paragraph that regulates the right to claim for damages ought to be revised. One way to do this would be to simplify the regulations, making them easier to understand and navigate. This could involve reducing the number of requirements for filing a claim, and providing clearer guidelines for what types of losses can be claimed for.

Another way to revise the paragraph would be to make the regulations more flexible. For example, there could be longer deadlines for filing claims, or more types of losses that can be claimed for. This would make it easier for individuals and businesses to seek the compensation that they are entitled to.

Another way would be to make the regulations more fair. For example, there could be limits on the amount of damages that can be claimed, to ensure that everyone is treated fairly. This would also help to prevent excessive claims and would promote a sense of fairness among individuals and businesses.

In conclusion, the right to claim for damages is a fundamental aspect of any legal system. However, the current regulations surrounding the right to claim for damages are often complex and difficult to navigate, making it difficult for individuals and businesses to seek the compensation that they are entitled to. To address this issue, the paragraph that regulates the right to claim for damages ought to be revised, in order to simplify the regulations, make them more flexible, and more fair. This would help to ensure that individuals and businesses are able to seek the compensation that they are entitled to, and would promote a sense of fairness among all parties involved.",1
596,4004.a2.txt,Unemployment jobs,"Unemployment is a major economic and social problem that affects millions of people around the world. It is defined as the state of being without work, but actively seeking and available for employment. Unemployment can have a number of negative effects on individuals and society, including reduced income, increased poverty, and reduced economic growth. One of the ways to address unemployment is by creating jobs specifically targeted at unemployed individuals.

Unemployment jobs are specifically designed to provide employment opportunities for unemployed individuals. These jobs can be created by the government, private companies, or non-profit organizations. They can be full-time or part-time, and can be paid or unpaid. The goal of unemployment jobs is to provide individuals with the opportunity to gain work experience, improve their skills, and increase their chances of finding permanent employment.

One of the most common types of unemployment jobs is public sector jobs, which are created by the government. These can include jobs in areas such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure development. These jobs can provide a stable income for unemployed individuals and also provide vital services to the community. For example, a government-funded program that hires unemployed individuals to work in schools as assistants can not only provide jobs but also improve the quality of education.

Another type of unemployment job is the private sector job, which is created by private companies. These can include jobs in areas such as customer service, sales, and manufacturing. Private sector jobs can provide a good opportunity for unemployed individuals to gain work experience, improve their skills, and increase their chances of finding permanent employment. For example, a retail store that hires unemployed individuals to work as cashiers can not only provide jobs but also improve customer service.

Non-profit organizations also play a significant role in creating unemployment jobs. These organizations can provide unpaid work opportunities in areas such as community development, environmental conservation, and social services. This can provide unemployed individuals with the opportunity to gain work experience, improve their skills, and increase their chances of finding permanent employment. Also, it can provide a sense of purpose and social impact for the individual and the community.

However, creating unemployment jobs is not without challenges. One major challenge is the cost of creating these jobs, as it can be expensive for the government, private companies, or non-profit organizations to create new jobs. Additionally, there may be a lack of funding or resources available to support these programs, which can make it difficult to sustain them over the long-term.

Another challenge is that unemployment jobs may not be able to provide the same level of job security or compensation as permanent jobs. This can make it difficult for individuals to support themselves and their families, which can lead to further economic and social problems.

Despite these challenges, unemployment jobs can be an effective way to address unemployment and its negative effects on individuals and society. They can provide individuals with the opportunity to gain work experience, improve their skills, and increase their chances of finding permanent employment. Additionally, they can provide vital services to the community and can have a positive impact on the economy.

In conclusion, unemployment jobs are specifically designed to provide employment opportunities for unemployed individuals. They can be created by the government, private companies, or non-profit organizations, and can provide individuals with the opportunity to gain work experience, improve their skills, and increase their chances of finding permanent employment. However, creating unemployment jobs can be challenging and may not provide the same level of job security or compensation as permanent jobs. Despite these challenges, unemployment jobs can be an effective way to address unemployment and its negative effects on individuals and society.",1
597,4005.a2.txt,Too Big to Be Beautiful - A glance at Swedish pre-schools,"The concept of ""too big to be beautiful"" is a term often used to describe large institutions, such as schools and pre-schools, that have become so large that they are no longer able to provide a high-quality educational experience for their students. This phenomenon can be seen in many countries around the world, including Sweden, where pre-schools have been growing in size over the past few decades.

In Sweden, pre-schools are commonly known as ""förskola"" or ""morgonskola"", and they are intended to provide children with a safe and nurturing environment where they can learn and grow. However, as pre-schools have grown in size, many have become too big to be beautiful, and are no longer able to provide the high-quality education that they were intended to.

One of the main issues with large pre-schools is that they can be impersonal and difficult for children to navigate. When pre-schools are too large, it can be hard for teachers and staff to get to know each child individually, and it can be hard for children to form meaningful relationships with their peers and teachers. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection, which can have a negative impact on children's social and emotional development.

Another issue with large pre-schools is that they can be overwhelming and stressful for children. When pre-schools are too large, there are often too many children and too much noise and activity, which can be overwhelming and confusing for children. This can make it difficult for children to focus and learn, and can also lead to feelings of stress and anxiety.

Large pre-schools can also be less safe than smaller ones. With a large number of children and staff in one place, it can be hard to keep track of everyone and ensure that everyone is safe. This can be especially concerning when dealing with young children, as they are more vulnerable to accidents and injuries.

Finally, large pre-schools can be less effective at providing a high-quality education than smaller ones. When pre-schools are too large, it can be hard for teachers to provide individualized instruction and support, and it can be hard for children to get the attention and guidance that they need to learn and grow. This can lead to children falling behind in their learning and development.

To address these issues, it is important for pre-schools to be kept at a manageable size. By keeping pre-schools smaller, it is easier for teachers and staff to get to know each child individually and form meaningful relationships. It is also easier to ensure that children are safe and that they are not overwhelmed by noise and activity. Additionally, with smaller class sizes, teachers can provide individualized instruction and support, which can lead to better educational outcomes for children.

One way to achieve this is by implementing caps on class sizes in pre-schools. This would ensure that pre-schools are not allowed to grow too large, and would help to ensure that the quality of education is not compromised. Additionally, it would help to ensure that children are safe and that they are not overwhelmed by noise and activity.

Another way would be to implement measures to promote the quality of education in pre-schools. This could include providing teachers with more training and support, and also making sure that pre-schools have adequate resources and materials for children to learn and grow.

In conclusion, the concept of ""too big to be beautiful"" is a term often used to describe large institutions, such as schools and pre-schools, that have become so large that they are no longer able to provide a high-quality educational experience for their students. This phenomenon can",1
598,4006.a2.txt,On the verge of a crisis.,"The issue of teacher salaries has been a contentious one for many years, with many educators arguing that they are not being paid enough for the important work that they do. This issue has been brought to the forefront recently as many teachers are nearing a crisis point, with many struggling to make ends meet despite working long hours and dedicating their lives to educating our children.

One of the main reasons why teachers are on the verge of a crisis is that their salaries have not kept pace with the cost of living. In many cases, teachers are earning the same or even less than they were several decades ago, despite the fact that the cost of living has increased significantly. This has made it increasingly difficult for teachers to make ends meet, with many struggling to pay for basic expenses such as rent, food, and healthcare.

Another reason why teachers are on the verge of a crisis is that they are often overworked and undervalued. Many teachers are required to work long hours, often taking work home with them, and are expected to be available for their students at all times. Despite this, they are not always compensated for the extra time and effort that they put in, and are often not given the recognition or appreciation that they deserve.

This lack of compensation and recognition can have a detrimental effect on the mental and physical well-being of teachers. Many teachers experience high levels of stress and burnout, which can lead to a host of health problems such as anxiety, depression, and even heart disease. In addition, the high stress and low pay can lead to high turnover rates in the profession, resulting in a lack of experienced educators and a lower quality of education for students.

The crisis in teacher salaries is also having a negative impact on the education system as a whole. When teachers are not paid a fair wage, it can be difficult for them to attract and retain talented individuals to the profession. This can lead to a shortage of qualified teachers, which can in turn lead to larger class sizes and a lower quality of education for students.

To address this crisis in teacher salaries, there needs to be a concerted effort to provide teachers with fair and competitive wages. This could include increasing teacher salaries to keep pace with the cost of living, and providing teachers with additional benefits such as health insurance and retirement plans. In addition, it is important to recognize the hard work and dedication of teachers by providing them with opportunities for professional development and advancement, as well as providing them with the support and resources they need to do their jobs effectively.

Another solution could be to provide more funding for education. This would allow for an increase in teacher salaries and also provide funding for other important aspects of education such as classroom materials and technology. Additionally, this would help to ensure that students are receiving the best education possible, which is critical for their future success.

In conclusion, the issue of teacher salaries is a crucial one that needs to be addressed immediately. Teachers are on the verge of a crisis, with many struggling to make ends meet despite working long hours and dedicating their lives to educating our children. This crisis is having a negative impact on both teachers and the education system as a whole. To address this issue, there needs to be a concerted effort to provide teachers with fair and competitive wages, as well as providing them with the support and resources they need to do their jobs effectively. Additionally, more funding for education is needed to ensure that students are receiving the best education possible, which is critical for their future success.",1
599,4008.a2.txt,Let homosexuals adopt,"The issue of whether or not homosexuals should be allowed to adopt children is a complex and controversial one. On one hand, many argue that homosexuals are just as capable of providing a loving and stable home for a child as heterosexuals, and that denying them the right to adopt is discriminatory and unjust. On the other hand, some argue that children are better off being raised by a mother and father, and that allowing homosexuals to adopt could have negative consequences for the child.

One of the main arguments in favor of allowing homosexuals to adopt is that they are just as capable of providing a loving and stable home for a child as heterosexuals. Research has shown that children raised by same-sex couples fare just as well as those raised by heterosexual couples in terms of their social, emotional, and cognitive development. Additionally, many homosexuals have been shown to be just as committed and capable parents as heterosexuals, and are often willing to provide a loving and stable home for a child who may not have one otherwise.

Another argument in favor of allowing homosexuals to adopt is that denying them the right to do so is discriminatory and unjust. Homosexuals are entitled to the same rights and protections as heterosexuals, and denying them the right to adopt simply because of their sexual orientation is a violation of their basic human rights. Additionally, denying homosexuals the right to adopt can also perpetuate negative stereotypes and prejudices about the gay community, which can have a detrimental effect on both individuals and society as a whole.

However, there are also arguments against allowing homosexuals to adopt. One of the main arguments is that children are better off being raised by a mother and father, and that allowing homosexuals to adopt could have negative consequences for the child. Some argue that children need both a mother and father to provide them with a well-rounded upbringing and that same-sex couples may not be able to provide the same level of guidance and support as a traditional family.

Another argument against allowing homosexuals to adopt is that it could lead to the breakdown of traditional family values and that it could have a negative impact on society as a whole. Some argue that allowing homosexuals to adopt could lead to a decline in traditional family structures, which could have negative consequences for both individuals and society.

Despite these arguments, it is important to note that many countries and states have already legalized adoption by same-sex couples, and research has shown that children raised by same-sex couples are as well-adjusted and successful as those raised by opposite-sex couples.

In conclusion, the issue of whether or not homosexuals should be allowed to adopt children is a complex and controversial one. However, the evidence suggests that homosexuals are just as capable of providing a loving and stable home for a child as heterosexuals, and that denying them the right to adopt is discriminatory and unjust. Additionally, denying homosexuals the right to adopt can perpetuate negative stereotypes and prejudices about the gay community. The best interest of the child should be the primary consideration when making decisions about adoption, and research has shown that children raised by same-sex couples fare just as well as those raised by opposite-sex couples. Therefore, it is important to allow homosexuals to adopt, so that more children can have access to loving, stable homes.",1
600,4009.a2.txt,Can we not have the opportunity to choose?,"The question of whether or not parents should stay at home with their children is a complex and controversial one. On one hand, many argue that parents should have the opportunity to choose whether or not they want to stay at home with their children, and that this choice should be respected and supported. On the other hand, some argue that parents should be encouraged to stay at home with their children, as this is in the best interest of the child and society as a whole.

One of the main arguments in favor of parents having the opportunity to choose whether or not they want to stay at home with their children is that it allows them to make the best decision for themselves and their family. Each family is unique and has different needs, and what works for one family may not work for another. Allowing parents the freedom to choose what is best for them and their children can help to ensure that each family is able to thrive and that children are able to receive the best possible care and support.

Another argument in favor of parents having the opportunity to choose whether or not they want to stay at home with their children is that it can promote gender equality. Many women still face discrimination in the workplace, and may not have the same opportunities as men. Allowing parents the freedom to choose whether or not they want to stay at home with their children can help to ensure that men and women have equal opportunities and that women are not forced to choose between their career and their family.

However, there are also arguments against parents having the opportunity to choose whether or not they want to stay at home with their children. One of the main arguments is that children are better off when their parents are able to stay at home with them, as this can provide them with the best possible care and support. Research has shown that children whose parents stay at home with them tend to do better in school and have better social and emotional development.",1
601,4010.a2.txt,Old fashioned or the hottest trend?,"Jeans are a timeless fashion staple that have been worn by people of all ages and backgrounds for decades. While they may be considered old fashioned by some, they continue to be a popular choice among individuals who appreciate their versatility and durability. In recent years, jeans have also become a hot trend among fashion-conscious individuals, who have been experimenting with new styles and designs to create a modern and unique look.

One of the reasons why jeans have remained popular for so long is their versatility. Jeans can be dressed up or down, making them suitable for a variety of occasions. They can be paired with a button-up shirt and blazer for a more formal look, or with a t-shirt and sneakers for a casual, everyday look. The ability to wear jeans in a variety of settings and styles makes them a versatile choice for people of all ages and backgrounds.

Another reason why jeans have remained popular is their durability. Jeans are made from tough denim fabric, which is known for its ability to withstand wear and tear. This makes them a practical choice for people who are looking for a long-lasting and reliable wardrobe staple. Jeans are also easy to care for, and can be worn for years with proper care and maintenance.

In recent years, jeans have also become a hot trend among fashion-conscious individuals. Many designers and fashion brands have been experimenting with new styles and designs to create a modern and unique look. Some of the latest trends in jeans include ripped and distressed designs, high-waisted styles, and wide-leg cuts. These new styles have helped to make jeans a fashion-forward choice, suitable for individuals who want to make a statement with their wardrobe.

Additionally, sustainable fashion has been on the rise, and jeans have been a big part of this trend. Brands have been using sustainable materials like organic cotton, and have been implementing circular economy practices, such as recycling and upcycling, to make their production more sustainable. This has made jeans a more environmentally-friendly choice and a trend that is not only fashionable but also ethical.

Despite being considered old fashioned by some, jeans have remained a popular fashion staple due to their versatility, durability, and ability to adapt to new trends. They continue to be a favorite among individuals of all ages, who appreciate their practicality and ability to adapt to new fashion trends.

602,4011.a2.txt,"There is more to your eighteenth birthday than your being allowed in to the local pub. You are now seen as an adult. This means you must start paying taxes, you are responsible for your own finances and debts, you can get married and take a bank loan to buy yourself a house or flat, you can drive a car or even a truck. You are now old enough to face criminal charges as an adult, which means you can be sent to prison. You are expected to do your military service and fight for your country in times of war. You can get a hunting certificate which entitles you to own a rifle. However, you are still not allowed to buy yourself, say, a bottle of wine to go with your meal. In my opinion a person entitled to all these things must also be able to take responsibility when it comes to buying alcohol, after all, it takes a lot more responsibility to deal with buying a house than with buying a bottle of wine.","The legal drinking age, which is the minimum age at which an individual is legally allowed to purchase and consume alcohol, varies from country to country and even within regions of a country. In many countries, the legal drinking age is 18 years old, while in others it is 21. The topic of legal drinking age has been a controversial one, with arguments for and against raising or lowering the age limit.

One argument for maintaining or raising the legal drinking age is that it helps to reduce the incidence of drunk driving and related accidents. Studies have shown that raising the legal drinking age to 21 has led to a decrease in the number of alcohol-related car crashes among young people. This is because individuals under the age of 21 are less likely to have access to alcohol, and therefore less likely to drink and drive.

Another argument for maintaining or raising the legal drinking age is that it can help to reduce the overall health risks associated with excessive alcohol consumption. Young people's brains are still developing until the age of 25, and excessive alcohol consumption at a young age can lead to long-term damage to cognitive and motor function. Additionally, drinking at a young age can also increase the likelihood of developing alcohol dependency later in life.

On the other hand, there are also arguments in favor of lowering the legal drinking age. One argument is that the current legal drinking age disproportionately affects young people and that it limits their freedom and ability to make responsible choices. Many young adults are able to handle alcohol responsibly and should be trusted to make their own decisions about when and how to drink.

Additionally, in many cultures, alcohol is a significant part of social and cultural practices, and not allowing young adults to participate in these practices can lead to a disconnection with their culture and community. Lowering the legal drinking age could help to facilitate the integration of young adults into their cultural and social communities.

Another argument in favor of lowering the legal drinking age is that it could help to reduce binge drinking among young people. As it stands now, many young adults who are not legally allowed to purchase alcohol will consume it in large quantities when they do have access to it, leading to binge drinking and related health risks. Lowering the legal drinking age could lead to a more moderate and responsible approach to alcohol consumption among young people.

It's worth noting that some countries have adopted alternative ways to control underage drinking, such as setting different age limits for purchasing, possession and consumption, or implementing stricter regulations for serving alcohol to minors.

In conclusion, the legal drinking age is a complex and controversial issue, with arguments for and against raising or lowering the age limit. While maintaining or raising the legal drinking age can help to reduce the incidence of drunk driving and related accidents, and can help to reduce the overall health risks associated with excessive alcohol consumption, lowering the legal drinking age could lead to more responsible decision making, cultural integration and reduction of binge drinking among young people. Ultimately, the most effective approach would be a comprehensive and balanced one, that takes into account the different perspectives and weighs the potential risks and benefits.",1
603,4012.a2.txt,The Society Gives Possibilities to Elderly People.,"As our population ages, it is important that society recognizes the contributions and potential of elderly individuals and provides them with the necessary opportunities and support to live fulfilling lives. The society can give possibilities to elderly people in a number of ways, including through employment, housing, healthcare, and social engagement.

One way that society can give possibilities to elderly people is through employment. Many elderly individuals are still capable of working and want to continue contributing to the workforce. However, discrimination and stereotypes about older workers can make it difficult for them to find and maintain employment. Society can provide possibilities for elderly people by implementing policies and practices that promote age diversity and inclusion in the workplace, such as offering flexible work arrangements and addressing age discrimination.

Another way that society can give possibilities to elderly people is through housing. As people age, their housing needs may change, and they may require specialized housing options such as assisted living facilities or nursing homes. However, access to affordable and appropriate housing can be limited for elderly individuals. Society can provide possibilities by investing in and promoting affordable and specialized housing options, and by addressing issues such as age discrimination in housing.

Additionally, society can give possibilities to elderly people by providing them with access to quality healthcare. As people age, they may require more frequent and specialized medical care. However, access to healthcare can be limited for elderly individuals due to financial and geographical constraints. Society can provide possibilities by investing in and promoting healthcare programs that target the elderly and by addressing issues such as age discrimination in healthcare.

Lastly, society can give possibilities to elderly people by promoting social engagement and connection. As people age, they may be at risk of isolation and loneliness. Society can provide possibilities by investing in and promoting community programs and activities that target the elderly and by addressing issues such as age discrimination in social engagement.

In conclusion, society has a role to play in providing possibilities for elderly people to live fulfilling lives. This can be achieved by promoting employment, housing, healthcare, and social engagement opportunities for elderly individuals. By recognizing the contributions and potential of elderly people and addressing issues such as age discrimination, society can create an environment where elderly individuals can thrive. It is important that society takes action to support the elderly population, not only to improve their quality of life but also to ensure that they continue to contribute to society in meaningful ways.",1
604,4013.a2.txt,THE RIGHT SIDE THERE SHOULD BE MORE EMPHASIS ON ARTISTIC SUBJECTS AT SCHOOL,"The emphasis on artistic subjects in schools has been a topic of debate for many years. While some argue that artistic subjects are important for the overall development of students, others argue that they should not be given as much importance as traditional academic subjects. However, there is a growing body of evidence that suggests that placing more emphasis on artistic subjects at school can have a number of benefits for students.

One of the main benefits of placing more emphasis on artistic subjects at school is that it can improve students' creativity and critical thinking skills. Artistic subjects such as music, art, and drama require students to think outside the box, to express themselves in new ways, and to solve problems in innovative ways. These skills are essential for success in the modern workforce, where creativity and critical thinking are highly valued.

Another benefit of placing more emphasis on artistic subjects at school is that it can improve students' mental and emotional well-being. Artistic subjects provide students with a way to express themselves and to connect with others, which can help to reduce stress and anxiety, and can improve overall emotional well-being. Additionally, artistic subjects can help to promote self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-awareness, which are all important for mental well-being.

Furthermore, artistic subjects can also help to improve students' academic performance. Studies have shown that students who participate in artistic subjects tend to perform better academically than those who do not. This is because artistic subjects can help to improve concentration, memory,",1
605,4014.a2.txt,"Unemployd, new assisstants at schools?","The issue of unemployment is one that affects people of all ages and backgrounds, but it is particularly problematic for recent graduates and those entering the workforce for the first time. In recent years, many schools have been experimenting with new programs and initiatives to provide unemployed individuals with the skills and training they need to find work. One such initiative is the introduction of unemployed assistants to schools.

Unemployed assistants are individuals who are currently unemployed but are willing to work in schools in exchange for training and experience. These assistants can provide valuable support to schools by assisting teachers with tasks such as lesson planning, classroom management, and administrative duties. In addition to providing much-needed support to schools, these assistants can also gain valuable experience and training that will help them to find work in the future.

One of the main benefits of having unemployed assistants in schools is that it can help to ease the burden on teachers. Schools are often understaffed, and teachers are often overworked and stressed. Unemployed assistants can help to take on some of the tasks that teachers would otherwise have to do, which can help to reduce stress and improve the overall effectiveness of the school.

Another benefit of having unemployed assistants in schools is that it can provide them with valuable skills and experience. Many unemployed individuals are lacking in job-specific skills and experience, which can make it difficult for them to find work. By working in schools, unemployed assistants can gain valuable skills and experience that will help them to find work in the future. They can also network and make connections with professionals in the field that can help them with finding a job.

Additionally, the presence of unemployed assistants in schools can also provide a positive impact on the students. The assistants can act as role models, providing students with inspiration and motivation to pursue their own goals and aspirations. They can also help to provide additional support and guidance to students, which can improve the overall effectiveness of the school.

However, it is important to note that there are also challenges that come with having unemployed assistants in schools. One challenge is that the assistants may not have the necessary qualifications or experience to work in a school setting. This can make it difficult for them to provide effective support to teachers and students. Additionally, it may be difficult for schools to find unemployed assistants who are a good fit for the school, which can create additional challenges.

In conclusion, having unemployed assistants in schools can be a valuable initiative that can help to ease the burden on teachers and provide unemployed individuals with valuable skills and experience. However, there are also challenges that come with this initiative, and it is important for schools to carefully consider these challenges and to implement the initiative in a way that will be most effective for both the school and the unemployed assistants. By addressing these challenges, schools can provide valuable support to unemployed individuals and improve the overall effectiveness of the school.",1
606,4015.a2.txt,NO SMOKING,"Smoking is a serious public health issue that has been linked to a number of negative health outcomes, including lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory illness. As a result, there has been a growing movement to reduce smoking and to create smoke-free environments. This movement is commonly referred to as ""no smoking"" and it is becoming increasingly popular and necessary.

One of the main reasons why no smoking is necessary is that it can help to improve public health. Smoking is a leading cause of preventable death and illness, and it is responsible for a significant proportion of the burden of disease worldwide. By creating smoke-free environments, it is possible to reduce exposure to secondhand smoke and to decrease the risk of smoking-related health problems.

Another reason why no smoking is necessary is that it can help to reduce smoking rates. By creating smoke-free environments, it can make it more difficult for people to smoke, which can help to discourage smoking and to decrease smoking rates. Additionally, by making smoking less visible, it can also help to reduce social norms that support smoking, which can help to decrease smoking rates further.

No smoking policies have been implemented in different places such as offices, restaurants, and public spaces. A smoke-free environment in the workplace can improve the health and well-being of employees, and it can also decrease absenteeism and increase productivity. Similarly, smoke-free restaurants and public spaces can provide a healthier environment for customers and visitors.

Additionally, no smoking policies can also help to reduce healthcare costs. Smoking is a major contributor to healthcare costs, and it is responsible for a significant proportion of the costs associated with healthcare. By reducing smoking rates, it is possible to decrease healthcare costs and to make healthcare more affordable for everyone.

However, it is important to note that no smoking policies can also have some negative effects. For example, some smokers may feel discriminated against or stigmatized as a result of no smoking policies. Additionally, some people may feel that their rights are being infringed upon by no smoking policies, and that they should be able to smoke if they choose to.

In conclusion, no smoking is a necessary movement that can help to improve public health, reduce smoking rates, and decrease healthcare costs. It can also provide a healthier environment for employees, customers, and visitors. However, it is important to consider the potential negative effects of no smoking policies, and to implement them in a way that is respectful and inclusive of all people. Ultimately, by reducing smoking and creating smoke-free environments, we can all benefit from improved health, reduced healthcare costs, and a better quality of life.",1
607,4016.a2.txt,"My life, my choice","Abortion is a highly controversial and divisive issue, with strong opinions on both sides of the debate. While some argue that a woman should have the right to make decisions about her own body and the fate of a pregnancy, others believe that abortion is morally wrong and should be illegal. The topic of abortion raises important questions about autonomy, morality, and the value of human life.

One of the main arguments in favor of abortion is that it is a matter of personal autonomy and choice. Women have the right to make decisions about their own bodies and the fate of a pregnancy. This includes the decision to terminate a pregnancy if they feel that it is not the right time for them to have a child, or if they are not in a position to raise a child. This is a deeply personal decision that should be left up to the individual woman and should not be subject to government interference or control.

Another argument in favor of abortion is that it is necessary to protect the health and well-being of women. Pregnancy and childbirth can be dangerous, and in some cases, it may be necessary to terminate a pregnancy in order to protect the health of the mother. Additionally, in cases of rape or incest, a woman should not be forced to carry a pregnancy to term against her will.

Additionally, some argue that the right to access safe and legal abortion is an important aspect of reproductive rights, and that it is necessary for gender equality. Denying women the right to make decisions about their own bodies and the fate of their pregnancies can perpetuate gender inequality and discrimination. Furthermore, the lack of access to safe and legal abortion can lead to dangerous and unsafe procedures, putting women's lives at risk.

On the other hand, some argue that abortion is morally wrong, as it ends the life of an unborn child. They believe that human life begins at conception, and that terminating a pregnancy is equivalent to taking the life of an innocent human being. Furthermore, some argue that there are alternatives to abortion, such as adoption, and that women should consider these options before terminating a pregnancy.

Additionally, some argue that the availability of abortion can lead to a devaluation of human life and a lack of respect for the sanctity of life. They argue that a society that readily accepts abortion may also be more likely to accept other forms of violence, such as euthanasia, or even to justify the killing of innocent people in war.

It's worth noting that regardless of personal beliefs, the access to safe and legal abortion is a fundamental right for women and should be guaranteed. Furthermore, it's important to consider the reality that in some countries, where abortion is illegal, women are still seeking to terminate their pregnancies, but in unsafe ways, putting their lives at risk.",1
608,4017.a2.txt,Myth or Reality?,"Myth and reality are often intertwined, with one influencing and shaping the other. A myth can be defined as a traditional story or belief that explains the beliefs or customs of a society, often involving gods or supernatural beings. Reality, on the other hand, refers to the state of things as they actually exist, rather than as they may be perceived or imagined.

The relationship between myth and reality is complex, with each influencing the other in various ways. For example, myths often reflect the beliefs and values of a society, and can shape the way in which people view the world and their place in it. They can also serve as a means of explaining the natural world and the forces that shape it.

However, myths can also be used to manipulate and control people, by providing a false sense of understanding or by reinforcing the power of certain individuals or groups. This is particularly true in societies where myths are used to justify the actions of those in power, or to maintain the status quo.

One of the most important ways in which myths shape reality is through their role in shaping culture and society. Myths often provide a sense of continuity and tradition, and can serve as a means of transmitting cultural values and beliefs from one generation to the next. They can also provide a sense of identity and belonging, helping people to feel connected to their community and to the larger society.

Additionally, myths can be used to explain the world around us and the forces that shape it. This can be seen in many ancient cultures, where myths were used to explain everything from the creation of the world to the origins of different species. This also applies in modern cultures as well, where myths can help people to understand and make sense of complex scientific or social phenomena.

However, myths can also be used to manipulate and control people. This is particularly true in societies where myths are used to justify the actions of those in power, or to maintain the status quo. For example, myths about race, gender, or religion can be used to justify discrimination and oppression, or to maintain the power of certain groups over others.

Another way in which myths shape reality is through their role in shaping our perceptions and understanding of the world. Myths can create a sense of order and meaning in the world, helping people to make sense of the complex and often chaotic nature of reality. They can also shape our understanding of ourselves and our place in the world.

In conclusion, myth and reality are closely intertwined, with each influencing the other in various ways. Myths can shape culture and society, provide a sense of continuity and tradition, and help people to understand and make sense of the world around them. However, myths can also be used to manipulate and control people, and to justify discrimination and oppression. It is important to be critical of the myths that shape our understanding of the world and our place in it, and to strive to understand reality as it actually exists.",1
609,4018.a2.txt,Legalize Abortion In The Whole World!,"Abortion is a controversial topic that has long been a subject of debate and discourse around the world. While some argue that it should be made legal and accessible to all women, others believe that it should be banned entirely. In this essay, I will argue that abortion should be legalized in the whole world.

One of the main reasons for legalizing abortion is that it is a fundamental human right. Every woman has the right to control her own body and make decisions about her own reproductive health. This includes the right to access safe and legal abortion services. Denying women the right to make decisions about their own bodies is a form of gender discrimination and a violation of human rights.

Additionally, making abortion illegal does not actually prevent women from seeking abortions. It only makes them less safe. When abortion is illegal, women are forced to seek out unsafe and unregulated abortion services, putting their lives at risk. In fact, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), unsafe abortions are a leading cause of maternal death and injury worldwide. Legalizing abortion would ensure that women have access to safe and legal abortion services, reducing the number of maternal deaths and injuries caused by unsafe abortions.

Furthermore, legalizing abortion would help to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies and the number of children born into poverty. When women have access to safe and legal abortion services, they are able to make informed decisions about their reproductive health and plan their families. This can help to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies and the number of children born into poverty, which would have a positive impact on both individuals and society as a whole.

Another reason for legalizing abortion is that it is a matter of personal choice. Every woman should have the freedom to make decisions about her own body and her own life. It is not the place of the government or society to dictate what a woman should do with her body. It is a woman's personal choice whether or not to have an abortion and no one should be able to take that choice away from her.

In addition, legalizing abortion would also help to reduce the number of unsafe and illegal abortions. When abortion is illegal, women are forced to seek out unsafe and unregulated abortion services. This puts their lives at risk and can lead to serious health complications. Legalizing abortion would ensure that women have access to safe and legal abortion services, reducing the number of maternal deaths and injuries caused by unsafe abortions.

Finally, legalizing abortion would also help to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies and the number of children born into poverty. When women have access to safe and legal abortion services, they are able to make informed decisions about their reproductive health and plan their families. This can help to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies and the number of children born into poverty, which would have a positive impact on both individuals and society as a whole.

In conclusion, there are many compelling reasons for legalizing abortion in the whole world. It is a fundamental human right, it would ensure that women have access to safe and legal abortion services, it would help to reduce the number of maternal deaths and injuries caused by unsafe abortions, and it would help to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies and the number of children born into poverty. Therefore, it is important that governments around the world work to make abortion legal and accessible to all women.",1
610,4019.a2.txt,Earning by working,"Earning by working is a fundamental aspect of modern society. It is the process by which individuals exchange their time, skills, and labor for financial compensation. This process is essential for individuals to support themselves and their families, as well as for the functioning of the economy as a whole.

One of the main benefits of earning by working is that it allows individuals to support themselves financially. This is particularly important in today's society, where the cost of living continues to rise. By earning money through work, individuals are able to pay for basic necessities such as food, housing, and healthcare, as well as other expenses such as education and transportation.

Furthermore, earning by working can also provide individuals with a sense of purpose and fulfillment. Work can give individuals a sense of accomplishment and pride, and can provide a sense of identity and self-worth. It also allows individuals to contribute to society and make a positive impact on the world around them.

In addition, earning by working is also essential for the functioning of the economy as a whole. It is the process by which goods and services are produced and exchanged, which is necessary for economic growth and development. When individuals are able to earn money through work, they are able to participate in the economy as consumers, which helps to drive economic growth.

Moreover, earning by working can also provide individuals with a sense of financial security. By earning a steady income, individuals are able to save and invest for the future, which can help to provide financial security for themselves and their families. Additionally, many jobs also provide benefits such as health insurance and retirement plans, which can help to protect individuals from financial insecurity in case of illness or injury.

However, earning by working is not without its challenges. One of the biggest challenges is the issue of income inequality. Despite the fact that many people are working hard, they are not able to earn enough money to support themselves and their families. This is particularly true for low-income and marginalized communities, who often struggle to find work that pays a living wage.

Another challenge is the issue of underemployment. Many individuals are unable to find work that is full-time, or that utilizes their skills and qualifications. This can lead to financial insecurity and a lack of fulfillment in one's work.

Additionally, the current economic system is heavily dependent on the exploitation of natural resources and labor, which can have negative impacts on the environment and communities. This is a matter of concern and this exploitation should be mitigated by the implementation of sustainable development policies.

To address these challenges, there is a need for systemic changes. Governments, businesses, and individuals must work together to create an economy that is fair and just for all. This includes implementing policies that address income inequality, such as minimum wage laws and progressive taxation, as well as policies that support full employment and job training programs.

In conclusion, earning by working is a fundamental aspect of modern society. It is the process by which individuals exchange their time, skills, and labor for financial compensation. This process is essential for individuals to support themselves and their families, as well as for the functioning of the economy as a whole. While there are challenges to earning by working, such as income inequality and underemployment, these challenges can be addressed through systemic changes that create a fair and just economy for all.",1
611,4020.a2.txt,"For what is it exactly about the royal family that we are supposed to respect? How have they contributed to improving the human condition? Is it their durability? Namely, that they are capable of sitting on the throne for years without once going to the toilet during a public engagement? No seriously, something is rotten in the state of Sweden when we are expected to bow to them, and address them by titles, simply because they were born with the name of Bernadotte.","Sweden is widely recognized as one of the most democratic countries in the world. The country has a long history of democratic governance, dating back to the late 18th century. Today, Sweden is considered a model of democratic governance, with a stable political system, a well-functioning government, and a high level of citizen participation.

One of the key features of Sweden's democracy is its parliamentary system of government. This system is based on the principle of representative democracy, where citizens elect representatives to make decisions on their behalf. The Swedish parliament, known as the Riksdag, is composed of 349 members who are elected every four years. The Riksdag is responsible for making laws and holding the government accountable to the people.

Another key feature of Sweden's democracy is the country's high level of citizen participation. Sweden has a high voter turnout, with more than 80% of eligible voters participating in national elections. Additionally, there are many opportunities for citizens to participate in the democratic process, such as through public debates, town hall meetings, and citizen initiatives.

Sweden also has a strong tradition of civil society, where citizens actively participate in the public sphere, through the formation of various organizations, clubs and movements. These organizations are often focused on issues such as environmental protection, human rights, and social justice, and they play an important role in shaping public policy.

Another important aspect of Sweden's democracy is its system of checks and balances. The Swedish government is divided into three branches: the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Each branch has its own specific responsibilities and authority. The legislative branch makes laws, the executive branch enforces laws, and the judicial branch interprets laws. This system of checks and balances ensures that no one branch of government becomes too powerful.

Sweden's democracy is also characterized by its commitment to social welfare. The country has a comprehensive welfare system that provides citizens with access to healthcare, education, and social security. The Swedish government places a strong emphasis on equality, and works to ensure that all citizens have equal opportunities and access to resources.

However, like any other democracy, Sweden is not immune to challenges and issues. One of the main challenges facing the country is the rise of right-wing populism. In recent years, right-wing populist parties have gained significant support in Sweden, and have been critical of the country's immigration policies and its welfare system. There is also a concern that the rise of populism could threaten the country's democratic institutions and values.

Another challenge facing Sweden is the country's aging population. The country's population is aging rapidly, and this is putting a strain on the country's welfare system and its economy. The Swedish government is working to address this issue by implementing policies that encourage immigration and support for working-age citizens.

In conclusion, Sweden is considered a model of democratic governance. The country has a long history of democratic governance, a stable political system, a well-functioning government, and a high level of citizen participation. Additionally, Sweden has a strong tradition of civil society and a comprehensive welfare system that provides citizens with access to healthcare, education, and social security. However, like any other democracy, Sweden is facing challenges such as the rise of right-wing populism and the country's aging population. The Swedish government must continue to work to address these challenges and ensure that the country's democratic institutions and values are protected.",1
612,4021.a2.txt,A world without television,"A world without television is a difficult concept to imagine. Television has become such an integral part of our daily lives, providing entertainment, news, and information to millions of people around the globe. But what would the world be like without it?

One of the most significant changes would be in the way we consume media. Without television, people would likely turn to other forms of entertainment such as reading books, going to the movies, or listening to music. They would likely also seek out news and information from other sources such as the internet, newspapers, and radio. This shift could have a profound impact on the media industry, as television is currently one of the primary sources of revenue for many media companies.

Another significant change would be in the way we communicate and interact with one another. Television has played a critical role in connecting people, both within their communities and across the globe. Without television, people would likely be more isolated, and it would be more difficult for people to stay informed about events happening in other parts of the world. This could result in a more insular and isolated society, where people have a more limited understanding of the world around them.

Additionally, television has played an important role in shaping our culture and society. From the way we dress to the way we talk, television has had a profound impact on the way we see ourselves and the world around us. Without television, people would likely be exposed to fewer cultural influences, and it could lead to a more homogenous society.

Moreover, television has been a powerful tool for advertising and marketing. Without television, companies and businesses would have to rely on other forms of advertising, such as the internet or print media. This could lead to a shift in the way companies market their products, and it could have a significant impact on the economy.

Additionally, television has played a crucial role in education, as it has been a source of learning and information for people of all ages. Without television, people would likely have fewer opportunities to learn and be exposed to new ideas and perspectives. This could have a negative impact on education and personal growth.

On the other hand, a world without television could have some positive effects as well. People would likely spend more time engaging in other activities, such as spending time with family and friends, reading, and participating in outdoor activities. Additionally, without the constant distractions and noise of television, people might be able to focus better on the present moment, and improve their mental and physical well-being.

In conclusion, a world without television would be vastly different from the world we know today. It would have a profound impact on the way we consume media, communicate and interact with one another, and shape our culture and society. It would also have an impact on the economy, education, and personal growth. While it is impossible to predict exactly what a world without television would be like, it is clear that it would be vastly different from the world we know today.",1

The death penalty has been used throughout history as a way to deter crime and to seek retribution for heinous acts. However, in recent years, there has been a growing movement to abolish the death penalty around the world. This essay will argue that the death penalty should be abolished because it is inhumane, costly, and does not effectively deter crime.

One of the main reasons to abolish the death penalty is that it is inhumane. The death penalty is a cruel and inhumane form of punishment that violates the basic human right to life. The death penalty also violates the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Moreover, there have been cases where people have been sentenced to death and later found to be innocent, which highlights the fallibility of the criminal justice system and the risk of executing innocent people.

Another reason to abolish the death penalty is that it is costly. The death penalty is much more expensive than life imprisonment. The cost of the death penalty comes from the legal process, the appeals process, and the cost of keeping an inmate on death row. Moreover, the death penalty has been found to be more expensive than life imprisonment without parole. The high cost of the death penalty diverts resources that could be used to improve the criminal justice system and support crime victims.

Furthermore, the death penalty does not effectively deter crime. Studies have shown that the death penalty is not a more effective deterrent than life imprisonment without parole. Moreover, states without the death penalty have lower crime rates than states with the death penalty. This suggests that the death penalty is not necessary to keep communities safe and to deter crime.

Additionally, abolishing the death penalty would align with the principles of justice and fairness. The death penalty is arbitrary and discriminatory, as it is applied disproportionately to the poor and minorities. Furthermore, the death penalty is often used to target those who are already marginalized and oppressed in society. Abolishing the death penalty would mean that society would no longer be complicit in the execution of marginalized and oppressed individuals.

Moreover, abolishing the death penalty would be in line with the trend of many countries around the world. Currently, over 100 countries have abolished the death penalty in law or in practice. Moreover, the number of countries that carry out executions is decreasing each year. This trend suggests that the death penalty is becoming less acceptable in the international community, and that the world is moving towards a more humane and fair system of justice.

In conclusion, the death penalty should be abolished because it is inhumane, costly, and does not effectively deter crime. Abolishing the death penalty would align with the principles of justice and fairness, and it would be in line with the trend of many countries around the world. The death penalty is a relic of the past that has no place in a modern and just society. It is time for the world to move towards a more humane and fair system of justice and abolish the death penalty.",1

617,4026.a2.txt,A modern monarchy,"A modern monarchy is a form of government in which a monarch serves as the head of state and serves as a symbolic figurehead. This system of government is a combination of traditional and modern elements, and it is characterized by a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch's powers are limited by a constitution.

One of the key features of a modern monarchy is that the monarch's powers are limited by a constitution. This ensures that the monarch does not have too much power and that the government is run by elected officials. This is in contrast to an absolute monarchy, in which the monarch has complete control over the government.

Another feature of a modern monarchy is that the monarch serves as a symbolic figurehead. The monarch represents the country on the international stage and serves as a unifying figure for the people. This is in contrast to a republic, in which the head of state is elected by the people.

Additionally, modern monarchies have a parliamentary system of government. This means that the government is run by elected officials, who are responsible for making laws and policies. The monarch has a ceremonial role, and the prime minister is the head of government. This system allows for a separation of powers, which helps to prevent any one person or group from having too much power.

Furthermore, in modern monarchies, the monarch's role is largely ceremonial, and they do not have any significant political power. They often act as a mediator between the government and the people, and they are expected to remain neutral in political matters. This is to ensure that the monarch does not become involved in politics and that the government is run by elected officials.

Moreover, modern monarchies also have a developed economy. They usually have a capitalist economic system, which is characterized by private ownership of businesses and resources. This system encourages competition, innovation, and economic growth. Additionally, modern monarchies have a high standard of living and a strong welfare system that provides for the basic needs of their citizens.

Furthermore, many modern monarchies have a tradition of democracy and civil rights. They usually have a system of regular elections, and citizens have the right to vote and participate in government. Additionally, they also have a developed legal system that guarantees the rights and freedoms of citizens, including freedom of speech, religion, and the press.

618,4027.a2.txt,NUCLEAR POWER vs. NATURAL SOURCES OF POWER.,"Nuclear power and natural sources of power are two different types of energy that are used to generate electricity. Nuclear power is generated by splitting atoms in a nuclear reactor, while natural sources of power are generated from renewable resources such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power. Both types of power have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the decision of which type of power to use is often based on a variety of factors.

One of the main advantages of nuclear power is its high energy density. Nuclear power plants can generate a large amount of electricity from a small amount of fuel. This makes nuclear power a very efficient form of energy, and it is able to produce a significant amount of electricity without producing a large amount of greenhouse gas emissions.

Another advantage of nuclear power is that it is a reliable source of energy. Nuclear power plants are able to produce electricity around the clock, which makes them well-suited to meet the base load power demand. Additionally, unlike other forms of power such as wind or solar, nuclear power does not depend on weather conditions and can operate on a consistent basis.

However, one of the main disadvantages of nuclear power is that it is associated with a number of safety risks. Nuclear power plants use radioactive materials, and if these materials are not handled and stored properly, they can pose a serious safety risk. Additionally, if there is a nuclear accident, the consequences can be severe and long-lasting.

Another disadvantage of nuclear power is that it is expensive to build and maintain. Nuclear power plants are complex and require a significant amount of money to build, maintain and decommission. Additionally, the cost of nuclear power can be affected by a number of factors such as regulations, taxes and other government policies.

On the other hand, natural sources of power have their own advantages and disadvantages. One of the main advantages of natural sources of power is that they are renewable and do not produce greenhouse gas emissions. They are a cleaner and more sustainable form of energy. Additionally, natural sources of power such as wind and solar are relatively low-cost and easy to install.

Another advantage of natural sources of power is that they are decentralized, which means that they can be generated closer to where the power is needed. This reduces the need for long-distance power transmission, which can be expensive and can also lead to power loss. Additionally, the decentralization of power production can also make the power grid more robust and less vulnerable to failure.

However, one of the main disadvantages of natural sources of power is that they are dependent on weather conditions. Solar and wind power, for example, are dependent on the sun and wind, respectively, which means that their power output can fluctuate depending on weather conditions. Additionally, natural sources of power may not be able to meet the base load power demand, which can make them less reliable.

Another disadvantage of natural sources of power is that they require large amounts of land. Wind turbines and solar panels require significant space to be installed, which can be an issue in densely populated areas. Additionally, the installation of natural sources of power can also be associated with a number of environmental impacts such as habitat loss, visual impact, and noise pollution.

623,4033.a2.txt,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT,"Capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, is the legal process of putting a person to death as a punishment for a crime they have committed. The use of capital punishment as a form of punishment for criminal offenses is a highly controversial and divisive issue, with strong arguments on both sides.

One of the main arguments in favor of capital punishment is that it serves as a deterrent to potential criminals. The theory is that the threat of the death penalty would deter individuals from committing heinous crimes, as they would be aware of the severe consequences if caught. Supporters of this theory argue that capital punishment serves as a way to protect society from dangerous criminals and to provide justice for victims and their families.

Another argument in favor of capital punishment is that it provides closure for the victims and their families. Many victims and their families feel that the perpetrator of a crime should be held accountable for their actions and that the death penalty serves as a way to provide closure and a sense of justice.

However, there are also many arguments against capital punishment. One of the main arguments is that it is morally wrong to take the life of a person, regardless of their actions. Additionally, some argue that the death penalty is often applied disproportionately to marginalized groups and individuals, leading to racial and socioeconomic bias in the criminal justice system. Furthermore, many people argue that capital punishment is not effective in deterring crime and that alternatives such as life imprisonment without parole would be more effective.

Another argument against capital punishment is that the system is fallible and that there is a risk of executing an innocent person. There have been cases where individuals have been found to be innocent after being sentenced to death, highlighting the potential for error in the criminal justice system.

Additionally, there are concerns over the cost of capital punishment. The process of imposing the death penalty, including the trial and appeals process, is often more expensive than keeping a person in prison for life. This has led some to argue that the resources and money spent on the death penalty would be better used on other programs and services that could improve public safety and reduce crime.

In conclusion, capital punishment is a highly controversial and divisive issue, with strong arguments on both sides. While some argue that it serves as a deterrent and provides closure for victims and their families, others argue that it is morally wrong, disproportionately affects marginalized groups, not effective in deterring crime, fallible and costly. It is important to weigh the arguments and consider the ethical, moral, and practical implications before coming to a conclusion. Each country and society needs to evaluate the effectiveness and the moral implications of capital punishment in their context and make a decision accordingly.",1
624,4035.a2.txt,Time for a law against Tobacco,"Tobacco is a dangerous and highly addictive substance that has been causing harm to individuals and society for decades. Despite the known health risks associated with its use, tobacco remains widely available and heavily marketed. To combat this public health crisis, it is necessary to enact a law against tobacco.

The first and most obvious reason for a law against tobacco is the detrimental effects it has on human health. Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death worldwide, responsible for over 7 million deaths per year. It is a major risk factor for a variety of serious diseases, including lung cancer, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Additionally, exposure to secondhand smoke is also a significant health concern, as it can cause cancer and other respiratory problems.

The economic burden of tobacco use is also significant. In addition to the direct healthcare costs associated with treating tobacco-related illnesses, there are also indirect costs such as lost productivity and increased absenteeism from work. The World Health Organization estimates that the global economic cost of tobacco use is over $1 trillion per year.

Another compelling reason for a law against tobacco is the impact it has on society as a whole. The marketing and promotion of tobacco products is a major contributor to its widespread use, particularly among young people. The tobacco industry spends billions of dollars annually on advertising and promotions, making it difficult for individuals to make informed decisions about the risks associated with its use. Additionally, the presence of tobacco products in stores and other public places can make it difficult for individuals to avoid exposure to them.

A law against tobacco could take many forms, including a ban on its sale, production, and marketing, as well as increased taxes on its purchase. These measures have been shown to be effective in reducing tobacco use in other countries. For example, in the United Kingdom, a comprehensive ban on smoking in public places was implemented in 2007. This law has been credited with a significant decrease in smoking rates and a corresponding reduction in the number of smoking-related deaths. Similarly, in Australia, the introduction of plain packaging laws and an increase in taxes on tobacco products has led to a decline in smoking rates.

Additionally, implementing laws that increase the minimum age to purchase tobacco products or prohibit vending machines and self-service displays can help reduce youth access to tobacco.

It is important to note that a law against tobacco would not be a silver bullet solution to the problem of smoking. However, it would be a necessary step in addressing the public health and economic consequences of tobacco use. Furthermore, it would also send a message that society will not tolerate the harm caused by this dangerous substance.

In conclusion, the evidence is clear that tobacco use is a major public health crisis that causes harm to individuals and society as a whole. A law against tobacco is necessary to address this problem and would take many forms, including a ban on its sale, production, and marketing, as well as increased taxes on its purchase. Implementing such laws would be an important step in reducing smoking rates and the associated health and economic costs.",1
625,4036.a2.txt,STATE CARE CANNOT REPLACE FAMILY CARE,"The role of the family in providing care for its members is vital and cannot be replaced by state care. Family care refers to the emotional and practical support provided by family members to one another, while state care refers to the care provided by government-funded institutions or agencies. While state care can play a complementary role in supporting families, it cannot replace the unique bond and sense of belonging that exists within a family.

One of the main reasons why state care cannot replace family care is that families provide a sense of emotional security and belonging that cannot be replicated by institutions. Family members have a unique understanding of one another, and they are able to provide emotional support and understanding in a way that is not possible for strangers. For example, a parent can provide a sense of comfort and security to a child that a state-funded caregiver cannot. The bond between family members is also much stronger than the bond between an individual and a state-funded caregiver.

Another reason why state care cannot replace family care is that families are able to provide practical support in a way that is not possible for institutions. Families can make decisions about care that are tailored to the individual needs of their members, and they can adapt their care as those needs change. For example, a family member can make decisions about how to care for an elderly parent at home, and can adapt their care as the parent's needs change. This flexibility is not possible for institutions, which have to follow set procedures and protocols.

Furthermore, family care is often more cost-effective than state care. Families can provide care at home, which is often less expensive than institutional care. Additionally, family members are often willing to provide care without pay, whereas state-funded caregivers are paid employees. This allows families to provide care at a lower cost than institutions.

However, state care can play a complementary role in supporting families. For example, state-funded institutions can provide respite care for family members who are providing care for a loved one. This can give family members the opportunity to take a break and recharge, which can help them to continue providing care for their loved one. Additionally, state-funded institutions can provide specialized care that may not be available within the family, such as medical care for a loved one with a complex medical condition.

In conclusion, state care cannot replace family care. Families provide a sense of emotional security and belonging that cannot be replicated by institutions, and they are able to provide practical support in a way that is not possible for institutions. Families can make decisions about care that are tailored to the individual needs of their members, and they can adapt their care as those needs change. State care can play a complementary role in supporting families, but it cannot replace the unique bond and sense of belonging that exists within a family. The importance of family care should be recognized and valued by society and the government should provide support to families in order to strengthen the family system.",1
626,4037.a2.txt,NO TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF XENOTRANSPLANTATION,"Xenotransplantation is the process of transplanting organs or tissues from one species to another. While this technology has the potential to alleviate the shortage of organ donors and save lives, it also poses significant ethical and safety concerns. For this reason, it is important to reject the development of xenotransplantation.

One of the main ethical concerns associated with xenotransplantation is the treatment of animals. In order for xenotransplantation to be successful, animals such as pigs or primates must be genetically modified and kept in captivity for the purpose of organ harvesting. This raises concerns about the welfare of these animals, as they may be subjected to inhumane conditions and suffering. Additionally, the use of animals for human benefit raises ethical questions about the moral status of animals and their rights.

Another ethical concern is the potential for xenotransplantation to perpetuate the exploitation of vulnerable populations. The development of xenotransplantation has been driven by the organ shortage crisis, which disproportionately affects marginalized communities such as people of color and low-income individuals. The use of organs from animals may further exacerbate these disparities, as vulnerable populations may be more likely to receive xenotransplants due to the shortage of human donors.

Additionally, there are significant safety concerns associated with xenotransplantation. One of the main risks is the potential for cross-species transmission of disease. Animals used for xenotransplantation may carry pathogens that can infect humans, and there is a risk that these pathogens may mutate and become more dangerous in a human host. There is also a risk of organ rejection, as the human immune system may view the animal organ as foreign and mount an attack. Furthermore, the long-term effects of xenotransplants are unknown and may pose unforeseen risks to the recipient.

In addition to the above mentioned concerns, it's also important to consider the fact that the development of xenotransplantation diverts resources and attention away from other potential solutions to the organ shortage crisis. Instead of focusing on xenotransplantation, we should prioritize measures such as increasing organ donation rates and developing alternatives to organ transplantation, such as artificial organs.

In conclusion, while xenotransplantation has the potential to save lives, the ethical and safety concerns associated with the technology outweigh the potential benefits. The treatment of animals, the exploitation of vulnerable populations, and the potential for cross-species transmission of disease and organ rejection make it clear that xenotransplantation is not a viable solution to the organ shortage crisis. Instead, we should focus on increasing organ donation rates and developing alternatives to organ transplantation.

It's also crucial to acknowledge that the organ shortage crisis is the result of larger systemic issues such as poverty and health disparities, addressing these issues will ultimately help in reducing the organ shortage crisis. Therefore, it's important that we work on addressing the root causes of this crisis, rather than looking for a quick fix in the form of xenotransplantation.",1
627,4039.a2.txt,Standing on the shoulders of giants,"The phrase ""standing on the shoulders of giants"" is attributed to the medieval philosopher and theologian, Isaac Newton. It is used to express the idea that the knowledge and achievements of the past form the foundation for the discoveries and advancements of the present. Newton used the metaphor to express his belief that his own scientific discoveries were built upon the work of the great scientists who had come before him.

The concept of standing on the shoulders of giants is particularly relevant in the field of science and technology, where progress is often made through the accumulation of knowledge and the building of upon previous discoveries. For example, the invention of the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876 was made possible by the work of other scientists who had previously discovered the properties of electricity and sound waves. Similarly, the development of the computer and the internet was made possible by the work of scientists who had previously discovered the properties of semiconductors and the principles of information theory.

This concept is not limited to the field of science and technology, it applies to all fields of study. In literature, for example, writers build upon the work of their predecessors, using their insights and techniques to create new works of art. Similarly, in business and economics, entrepreneurs and managers stand on the shoulders of giants by building upon the successes and failures of their predecessors.

The idea of standing on the shoulders of giants also highlights the importance of collaboration and the sharing of knowledge. Newton himself acknowledged that his work was made possible by the contributions of other scientists, and he emphasized the importance of sharing knowledge and collaborating with others in order to make further discoveries. This idea is reflected in the modern scientific community, where collaboration and the sharing of data and resources are essential for making new discoveries and advancements.

However, it's also important to note that standing on the shoulders of giants does not mean blindly following the ideas and methods of the past without critical thinking. Instead, it's important to question and challenge the existing knowledge in order to make progress and discoveries. This is done by building on the knowledge of the past, testing it, and refining it.

In conclusion, the concept of standing on the shoulders of giants highlights the importance of building upon the knowledge and achievements of the past in order to make new discoveries and advancements. It is particularly relevant in the field of science and technology, but it applies to all fields of study. The idea also emphasizes the importance of collaboration and the sharing of knowledge in order to make progress. Additionally, it's important to question and challenge the existing knowledge, rather than blindly following the ideas and methods of the past.",1
628,4040.a2.txt,Can you feel the scent of paper in our Electronic world?,"In today's world, we are increasingly reliant on electronic devices and the internet for information and communication. While these technologies have brought many benefits, they have also led to a decline in the use of traditional forms of media such as books, newspapers, and magazines. One aspect of traditional media that is often overlooked is the sense of smell, as paper has its own distinct scent. In this essay, I will explore the question of whether it is possible to feel the scent of paper in our electronic world, and what this might mean for our sensory experiences.

To begin with, it is worth noting that the sense of smell is closely linked to our memories and emotions. A familiar scent can evoke powerful memories and feelings, and this is especially true for the scent of paper. The smell of an old book, for example, can transport us back to a specific time and place, and it can evoke feelings of nostalgia and comfort. In contrast, the lack of a physical scent in electronic media can make the experience feel more impersonal and detached.

However, it is not only the physical aspect of paper that holds the scent, but also the cultural and social context that surrounds it. For example, the scent of a freshly printed newspaper can remind us of our daily routine and the act of reading the news in the morning. Similarly, the scent of a new book can remind us of the excitement and anticipation of starting a new novel. These cultural and social associations are missing in electronic media, which can make the experience feel less engaging and immersive.

Moreover, the sense of smell plays an important role in our sense of touch. When we hold a book or a magazine, the sensation of the paper against our skin, the weight and texture of the pages, and the sound of turning the pages all contribute to our overall sensory experience. In contrast, electronic devices lack the tactile sensation of paper, which can make the experience feel less satisfying and immersive.

Additionally, the physicality of paper has an intrinsic value that can't be replicated by electronic media. Holding a physical book, newspaper, or magazine gives a sense of ownership and permanence that is not present when reading from a digital device. The physicality of paper also allows for the possibility of annotation, highlighting and underlining, which can enhance the reading experience and make it more personal.

On the other hand, it's important to acknowledge that electronic media has its own unique advantages, such as the ability to search, highlight, and share content easily, as well as the convenience of being able to access information from anywhere at any time. Also, electronic devices are environmentally friendly as it reduces the consumption of paper, which is a finite resource and the production of paper has a significant impact on the environment.

In conclusion, while electronic media can provide a convenient and efficient way to access information, it cannot replicate the sensory experience of paper. The scent of paper and the physicality of traditional media can evoke powerful memories and feelings, and it plays an important role in our sense of touch and cultural and social context. The physicality of paper also holds an intrinsic value that can't be replicated by electronic media. However, this doesn't mean that we should reject electronic media, but rather find a balance between utilizing its advantages and preserving the sensory experience that traditional media offers.",1
629,4041.a2.txt,Why we need students grants,"""Students grants are a vital form of financial aid that can help to make higher education more accessible and affordable for individuals from all backgrounds. There are several reasons why we need students grants, including:

Access to Higher Education: One of the main reasons why we need students grants is that they can help to make higher education more accessible to individuals from low-income families and other disadvantaged groups. Without grants, many students may not be able to afford the high costs of tuition, fees, books, and other expenses associated with attending college or university. This can limit their opportunities for academic and career advancement, as well as their ability to contribute to society.

Reducing Student Debt: Another reason why we need students grants is that they can help to reduce the amount of debt that students accumulate. Many students rely on loans to pay for their education, and these loans can be a significant financial burden. By providing grants, rather than loans, students are able to pay for their education without having to incur large amounts of debt. This can help to reduce their financial stress and allow them to focus on their studies.

Promoting Social Mobility: Students grants can also help to promote social mobility by making it possible for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds to access higher education and improve their economic prospects. This is especially important in today's economy, where a college degree is increasingly necessary to secure well-paying jobs.

Supporting Workforce Development: In addition to promoting social mobility, students grants can also support workforce development by helping to ensure that there is a skilled and educated workforce. This is important for the economic growth and development of a country, as well as for the competitiveness of its businesses.

Encouraging Diversity: Students grants can also help to encourage diversity in higher education by making it possible for individuals from underrepresented groups to attend college or university. This can lead to a more diverse and inclusive student body, which can benefit everyone by fostering a more open and tolerant campus culture.

Despite the many benefits of students grants, there are still many individuals who are unable to access higher education due to financial constraints. To ensure that all students have the opportunity to pursue higher education, there is a need for more funding for grants and scholarships, as well as for more outreach and support services to help students apply for and receive financial aid.

In conclusion, students grants are a vital form of financial aid that can help to make higher education more accessible and affordable for individuals from all backgrounds. These grants can also help to reduce student debt, promote social mobility, support workforce development, and encourage diversity in higher education. To ensure that all students have the opportunity to pursue higher education, there is a need for more funding for grants and scholarships, as well as for more outreach and support services to help students apply for and receive financial aid.""",1
630,4042.a2.txt,Girls and boys in separate classes?,"The debate over whether girls and boys should be in separate classes has been ongoing for decades. There are valid arguments on both sides of the issue, and ultimately, the decision of whether to separate the sexes in the classroom is a complex one that should be made on a case-by-case basis.

Proponents of separating girls and boys in the classroom argue that it can lead to a more focused and productive learning environment. Boys and girls have different learning styles and often have different interests, and separating them can allow for tailored instruction that caters to their unique needs. Additionally, some argue that separating the sexes can reduce distractions and disruptions, as students may be less likely to engage in behaviors such as flirting or horseplay if they are not in the same class as the opposite sex.

Another argument in favor of separating girls and boys is that it can help to reduce gender stereotypes and bias. In co-ed classrooms, girls may feel pressure to conform to traditional gender roles, while boys may feel pressure to act more aggressively or competitively. By separating the sexes, students may be less likely to feel these pressures, and may be more likely to develop their own interests and abilities without feeling constrained by societal expectations.

On the other hand, opponents of separating girls and boys argue that it can lead to increased gender stereotyping and bias. In a single-sex classroom, students may be more likely to fall back on traditional gender roles and stereotypes, rather than challenging and breaking down these stereotypes. Additionally, some argue that separating girls and boys can create a sense of ""otherness"" between the sexes, which can lead to increased prejudice and discrimination.

Another argument against separating girls and boys is that it can limit opportunities for socialization and learning from one another. In a co-ed classroom, students of different genders can learn from each other's perspectives, experiences, and ways of thinking. This can help to broaden students' perspectives and foster greater empathy and understanding. Additionally, students who attend single-sex schools or classes may have fewer opportunities to interact with and learn from individuals of the opposite sex, which can negatively impact their social and emotional development.

In conclusion, the decision of whether to separate girls and boys in the classroom is a complex one that should be made on a case-by-case basis. Both sides of the argument have valid points, and ultimately, the decision should be based on the specific needs and goals of the students, as well as the resources and capabilities of the school. While there are benefits to separating the sexes in the classroom, it is important to consider the potential downsides as well, and to strive for a balance between meeting the unique needs of individual students and fostering socialization and understanding between the sexes.",1
631,4043.a2.txt,The Elderly Need the State,"The elderly population is one of the most vulnerable groups in society, and as such, they require the support and care of the state to ensure that they can live their lives with dignity and security. The state has a responsibility to provide for the needs of its citizens, and this includes ensuring that the elderly population is able to access the services and support that they need.

One of the most important ways in which the state can support the elderly is through the provision of healthcare services. As people age, they become more susceptible to a range of health conditions, and they may require more specialized medical treatment than younger people. The state should ensure that the elderly have access to quality healthcare services, including doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals who are trained to provide care to older adults.

Another important way in which the state can support the elderly is through the provision of social services. Many older adults live alone or have limited family support, and they may require help with daily tasks such as shopping, cleaning, and cooking. The state should provide social services that can help older adults with these tasks, such as home care services, meal delivery programs, and transportation services.

The state can also support the elderly by providing them with financial assistance. Many older adults have limited income, and they may struggle to pay for basic necessities such as food, housing, and medication. The state should provide financial assistance programs that can help older adults to meet these needs, such as pension schemes, and social security benefits.

The state can also support the elderly by helping them to stay active and engaged in their communities. Many older adults suffer from isolation and loneliness, and they may benefit from programs that help them to stay connected with others. The state should provide opportunities for older adults to participate in community activities, such as volunteer work, social clubs, and educational programs.

Finally, the state can support the elderly by providing them with legal protection. Many older adults are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, and they may require legal assistance to protect their rights and interests. The state should provide legal services to older adults, such as representation in court, and help with drafting legal documents.

In conclusion, the elderly population is one of the most vulnerable groups in society, and they require the support and care of the state to ensure that they can live their lives with dignity and security. The state has a responsibility to provide for the needs of its citizens, and this includes ensuring that the elderly population is able to access the services and support that they need. This includes healthcare, social services, financial assistance, community engagement, and legal protection. The state must take proactive steps to ensure that the elderly are not left behind and that they can live their lives with dignity and respect.",1
632,4044.a2.txt,Should the family look after the elderly?,"The question of whether the family should be responsible for looking after the elderly is a complex and nuanced one. On one hand, the family is often the primary source of emotional and practical support for older adults, and they may be best placed to provide care and assistance. On the other hand, many families may not have the resources or ability to provide the level of care that older adults need, and in some cases, older adults may prefer to receive care from professionals.

One argument in favor of families looking after the elderly is that they can provide a more personalized and compassionate level of care. Family members are often more invested in the well-being of older adults, and they may be better equipped to understand and respond to their unique needs and preferences. For example, a family member may be more likely to anticipate an older adult's needs and provide them with assistance before they even ask for it. Additionally, older adults may feel more comfortable and secure in their own homes, surrounded by familiar faces and memories, rather than in a institutional care facility.

Another argument in favor of families looking after the elderly is that it can be more cost-effective. Many older adults require assistance with daily tasks such as bathing, dressing, and eating, and these tasks can be provided by family members without incurring additional costs. Additionally, older adults may not need to move into assisted living facilities or nursing homes, which can be costly, if they are able to receive care from family members.

However, there are also several arguments against families being solely responsible for looking after the elderly. One argument is that many families may not have the ability or resources to provide the level of care that older adults need. For example, some family members may not have the skills or knowledge to provide medical care, and older adults may require specialized treatment or medication. Additionally, some family members may not be able to take on the additional responsibilities of caring for an older adult, due to work or family commitments.

Another argument against families looking after the elderly is that older adults may prefer to receive care from professionals. Many older adults may feel more comfortable receiving care from individuals who are trained and experienced in providing care to older adults. Additionally, older adults may prefer to live in facilities that are designed specifically for older adults, and that provide a range of services and activities.

Finally, there is also an argument that it's not fair to put the entire responsibility of caregiving on the family. It's important to understand that caregiving can be a challenging and demanding role, and it can take a toll on the physical and mental health of the caregiver. It's also important to consider the fact that family members might not have the same level of training and experience as professional caregivers and might not be equipped to handle certain challenges that might arise.

In conclusion, whether the family should be responsible for looking after the elderly is a complex and nuanced question. While families can provide a more personalized and compassionate level of care, and it can be more cost-effective, many families may not have the ability or resources to provide the level of care that older adults need. Additionally, older adults may prefer to receive care from professionals. It's important to find a balance between both and to involve the older adults themselves in the decision-making process. It's also important to recognize that caregiving is a shared responsibility and the state and society should also play a role in ensuring that older adults receive the support they need.",1
633,4045.a2.txt,What about Systembolaget?,"Systembolaget, also known as the Swedish Systembolaget, is a government-owned chain of liquor stores in Sweden. The primary purpose of Systembolaget is to control the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the country, with the goal of reducing alcohol-related harm and promoting a responsible approach to alcohol consumption.

The origins of Systembolaget can be traced back to the early 20th century, when concerns about the negative effects of alcohol on society began to grow. In the years leading up to the establishment of Systembolaget, the Swedish government implemented a number of measures aimed at reducing alcohol consumption, such as increasing taxes on alcoholic beverages and restricting the hours of operation for bars and taverns. However, these measures were not seen as effective in controlling the sale and distribution of alcohol, and the government ultimately decided to establish a state-controlled system for the sale of alcohol.

Under the Systembolaget system, all alcoholic beverages with an alcohol content of over 3.5% are sold exclusively through government-owned stores. This includes a wide range of products, from beer and wine to spirits and liqueurs. The government sets prices for all products sold through Systembolaget, and the stores are only allowed to operate during certain hours and are closed on Sundays and public holidays.

One of the main goals of Systembolaget is to reduce alcohol-related harm in society. By controlling the sale and distribution of alcohol, the government hopes to reduce the overall consumption of alcohol, and in turn, reduce the number of alcohol-related accidents, illnesses, and crimes. Additionally, by setting prices for alcoholic beverages, the government aims to discourage excessive drinking by making it less affordable.

Another goal of Systembolaget is to promote a responsible approach to alcohol consumption. The stores employ trained staff who can provide customers with information and advice about different types of alcoholic beverages, and they are trained to identify and refuse service to individuals who appear to be under the influence of alcohol. Additionally, by operating only during certain hours and being closed on Sundays and public holidays, the government hopes to discourage excessive drinking and reduce the number of alcohol-related incidents that occur on weekends and holidays.

Despite its goals, the Systembolaget system has been the subject of ongoing debate and criticism. Some argue that the government's control over the sale and distribution of alcohol is an infringement on personal freedom, while others argue that the system is inefficient and costly. Additionally, some critics argue that the restrictions on the sale of alcohol, such as the limited hours of operation and the ban on Sunday sales, lead to increased demand for alcohol on weekends and holidays, which can result in higher levels of alcohol-related incidents and accidents.

In conclusion, Systembolaget is a government-controlled system for the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in Sweden. The primary goal of Systembolaget is to reduce alcohol-related harm and promote a responsible approach to alcohol consumption. While the system has its critics, it has been successful in reducing overall alcohol consumption and alcohol-related incidents in Sweden. However, it's important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to alcohol policies and that each country should develop policies that suit its specific needs and culture.",1

635,5001.a2.txt,SWEDEN IS NOT YET A TRUE DEMOCRACY!,"Sweden is often considered to be one of the most democratic countries in the world, with a long history of political stability and a strong tradition of civic engagement. However, it is important to note that while Sweden has many democratic institutions and practices in place, it is not yet a true democracy. There are several areas in which the country falls short of meeting the full definition of a democracy.

One area in which Sweden falls short of being a true democracy is in terms of political representation. While the country has a multi-party system and regular elections, the representation of certain groups within society is not always equal. For example, the representation of women and minority groups in the Swedish parliament is still relatively low, and it has been argued that this is indicative of a lack of true political representation in the country.

Another area in which Sweden falls short of being a true democracy is in terms of the role of the media. While the country has a relatively free press, the media landscape is dominated by a small number of large corporations, which can lead to a lack of diversity in the information available to citizens. Additionally, the media can be influenced by political and economic interests, which can lead to a lack of critical reporting and a lack of true public scrutiny of government actions.

Additionally, there are concerns about the state of civil liberties in Sweden. The country has a history of surveillance and censorship, with legislation that allows for the surveillance of citizens and limits on freedom of expression. This can be seen as a violation of the democratic principle of individual rights and freedoms.

Furthermore, the political process in Sweden is not always as transparent as it could be. The decision-making process in the country can be complex and opaque, making it difficult for citizens to understand and participate in the democratic process. This can lead to a lack of public trust in government institutions and a lack of true political participation.

The country falls short of meeting the full definition of a democracy in several areas, including political representation, the role of the media, civil liberties, and the transparency of the political process. It's important to acknowledge these shortcomings and to work towards addressing them to ensure that all citizens have an equal opportunity to participate in the democratic process and have their voices heard. It's also important to remember that democracy is an ongoing process and that even the most established democracies have room for improvement.",1

However, it is also important for children to have the opportunity to explore and play with language, without the pressure of spelling correctly. This essay will argue that children should be allowed to try the game of spelling before they have to spell words correctly.

One of the main arguments in favor of allowing children to try the game of spelling before they have to spell words correctly is that it allows them to explore and play with language in a fun and engaging way. Children are naturally curious and enjoy experimenting with new words and sounds. By allowing them to play with spelling, children can develop a love for language and a desire to learn more about it. Additionally, by allowing children to try the game of spelling, they can develop a deeper understanding of the sounds and patterns of words, which will make it easier for them to learn how to spell correctly.

Another argument in favor of allowing children to try the game of spelling before they have to spell words correctly is that it can help to reduce the stress and anxiety associated with learning to spell. Children may feel pressure to spell words correctly, and this pressure can lead to frustration, anxiety, and even a lack of motivation to learn. By allowing children to try the game of spelling, they can learn to spell words in a more relaxed and enjoyable way, which can help to reduce stress and anxiety.

Moreover, allowing children to try the game of spelling before they have to spell words correctly also allows them to develop their creativity and imagination. Children can use the sounds and patterns of words to create their own stories, poems, and songs. By allowing children to play with spelling, they can develop their creativity and imagination, which will help them to be more successful in all aspects of their education.

Additionally, allowing children to try the game of spelling before they have to spell words correctly also allows them to develop their problem-solving and critical thinking skills. Children have to figure out different ways to spell words, and this process requires them to think critically and to solve problems. By allowing children to try the game of spelling, they can develop their problem-solving and critical thinking skills, which will be beneficial for them in all areas of their education.

It's important to note that while it's crucial to give children the opportunity to try the game of spelling before they have to spell words correctly, it's also important to provide them with the necessary instruction and guidance to learn how to spell correctly. Children need to learn the correct spelling of words and understand the rules of spelling. It's important to balance the",1

639,5005.a2.txt,CHANGE THE AGE LIMIT FOR BUYING ALCOHOL,"The age limit for buying alcohol is an important issue that has been widely debated in many countries. The current age limit for buying alcohol varies depending on the country and the type of alcohol, with some countries having a minimum age limit of 18 and others having a minimum age limit of 21. This essay will argue that the age limit for buying alcohol should be changed to a higher age limit, as it can help to reduce the negative impacts of alcohol on society.

One of the main reasons why the age limit for buying alcohol should be changed to a higher age limit is that it can help to reduce the negative impacts of alcohol on young people. Research has shown that young people who start drinking at a young age are more likely to experience negative consequences from alcohol use, such as alcohol addiction, alcoholism, and other health problems. By raising the age limit for buying alcohol, it can help to reduce the negative impacts of alcohol on young people, as they will be less likely to start drinking at a young age.

Another reason why the age limit for buying alcohol should be changed to a higher age limit is that it can help to reduce alcohol-related crime and violence. Research has shown that young people who drink are more likely to be involved in alcohol-related crime and violence, such as fights, vandalism, and sexual assault. By raising the age limit for buying alcohol, it can help to reduce alcohol-related crime and violence, as young people will be less likely to be involved in these types of activities if they are not able to purchase alcohol.

Moreover, raising the age limit for buying alcohol can also help to reduce the number of traffic accidents caused by drunk driving. Research has shown that young people are more likely to drive under the influence of alcohol, and that this is a major cause of traffic accidents. By raising the age limit for buying alcohol, it can help to reduce the number of traffic accidents caused by drunk driving, as young people will be less likely to drink and drive if they are not able to purchase alcohol.

Additionally, raising the age limit for buying alcohol can also help to reduce the number of alcohol-related deaths and injuries.

It's important to note that while raising the age limit for buying alcohol can help to reduce the negative impacts of alcohol on society, it's also important to ensure that young people are not criminalized for their behavior. It's important to ensure that young people are educated about the risks of alcohol use and that they have access to appropriate support and resources if they do choose to drink. Additionally, it's also important to ensure that there is enforcement of the age limit for buying alcohol, to ensure that young people are not able to purchase alcohol illegally.

640,5006.a2.txt,EU- The new Sovjet-union,"The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has been widely acknowledged as a successful model of regional integration and cooperation, with many benefits for its member states and citizens. However, some have criticized the EU and have compared it to the Soviet Union, claiming that it has become a new form of authoritarian governance. This essay will examine this claim and argue that the EU is not a new Soviet-Union.

One of the main criticisms of the EU is that it is an undemocratic institution that is controlled by a small group of unelected bureaucrats. Some have claimed that the EU is similar to the Soviet Union, in that it is controlled by a small group of elites who make decisions without the input or consent of the citizens. However, this claim is not accurate. The EU has a complex system of decision-making that involves both elected representatives and unelected bureaucrats. The European Parliament, which is directly elected by citizens, has significant powers in the EU's decision-making process, and the European Commission, the EU's executive body, is accountable to the European Parliament. Additionally, the EU is based on the rule of law and the protection of human rights, fundamental values that were not respected in the Soviet Union.

Another criticism of the EU is that it is undermining the sovereignty of its member states. Some have claimed that the EU is similar to the Soviet Union, in that it is centralizing power and taking away the ability of member states to govern themselves. However, this claim is also not accurate. The EU is based on the principle of subsidiarity, which means that decisions are made at the level that is closest to the citizens. The EU only acts in areas where it can achieve more than the member states acting alone. It does not take away the authority of member states, but rather complement them.

Furthermore, the EU is not a homogeneous entity, it's a union of diverse countries with different cultures, languages, and political systems. The EU respects the diversity of its member states and does not try to impose a one-size-fits-all solution on them. The EU is not trying to create a super-state, it's trying to create a union of sovereign states that work together for the benefit of all.

Additionally, the EU is not an autocratic entity, it's a union that is based on the democratic principles of transparency, accountability, and participation. The EU institutions are transparent and accountable to citizens. The EU's decision-making process is based on the principle of participation, which means that all member states have a say in the decisions that affect them. The EU operates on a system of checks and balances, where no one institution has too much power.

It's important to note that the EU is not perfect, like any other political institution it has its own challenges and shortcomings. The EU has been criticized for its handling of the refugee crisis and the economic crisis, among other issues. Additionally, the EU has been criticized for its lack of democratic accountability, particularly in relation to the euro crisis and the management of the EU's external borders. However, these criticisms do not mean that the EU is a new Soviet-Union,",1
641,5007.a2.txt,THE CARE FOR THE ELDERLY IS THE STATES RESPONSIBILITY,"The care for the elderly is a critical issue that affects many individuals and families around the world. The question of who should be responsible for providing care and support for older adults is a complex and nuanced one, with valid arguments on both sides. However, this essay will argue that the care for the elderly is the state's responsibility.

One of the main reasons why the care for the elderly is the state's responsibility is that it is a societal issue that affects all citizens. As the population ages, the number of older adults who need care and support will continue to grow. This is a problem that affects everyone and not just the families of older adults. Therefore, it is the state's responsibility to ensure that older adults have access to the care and support they need.

Another reason why the care for the elderly is the state's responsibility is that it can provide a more comprehensive and consistent level of care. The state has the resources and infrastructure to provide a wide range of services and support for older adults, including healthcare, housing, and social services. These services can be coordinated and provided in a consistent manner, ensuring that older adults receive the care and support they need. Furthermore, the state has the ability to provide a safety net for those who are unable to get care from family or private sectors.

Additionally, the state has the capacity to provide a higher standard of care for older adults. The state can invest in the necessary resources and infrastructure to provide high-quality care and support for older adults, such as hiring qualified and trained staff, investing in technology and equipment, and building specialized facilities. By providing a higher standard of care, the state can ensure that older adults are able to age with dignity and independence.

Furthermore, the state has the ability to provide care and support to older adults in a non-discriminatory manner. The state is not influenced by factors such as family dynamics, personal biases, or financial considerations, which can impact the",1
642,5008.a2.txt,"University students should be given grants, not loans, to finance their studies.","Financing a university education is a significant financial burden for many students and their families. The cost of tuition, books, and living expenses can be substantial, and many students are forced to take out loans to pay for their education. However, this essay will argue that university students should be given grants, not loans, to finance their studies.

One of the main reasons why university students should be given grants instead of loans is that grants do not have to be repaid. Loans, on the other hand, must be repaid with interest, which can add a significant financial burden to students after they graduate. This can make it difficult for students to afford basic necessities, such as housing and food, and can delay their ability to save for their future. Grants, on the other hand, do not have to be repaid, which means that students will not have to worry about repaying debt after they graduate.

Another reason why university students should be given grants instead of loans is that grants can help to reduce the financial burden on students and their families. Many students and their families struggle to afford the cost of a university education, and taking out loans can add to this financial burden. Grants, on the other hand, can help to reduce the financial burden on students and their families, as they do not have to be repaid. This can help to make a university education more accessible to students from lower-income families, who may not be able to afford the cost of a university education without financial assistance.

Additionally, grants can help to promote social mobility by providing students from lower-income families with the financial assistance they need to attend university. Studies have shown that students from lower-income families are less likely to attend university than their more affluent peers, and this can limit their opportunities for social mobility. Grants can help to level the playing field by providing students from lower-income families with the financial assistance they need to attend university and achieve their full potential.

Furthermore, grants can help to promote diversity and inclusivity in higher education. Studies have shown that students from underrepresented groups, such as first-generation college students and students from minority backgrounds, are less likely to attend university than their more affluent peers. Grants can help to promote diversity and inclusivity by providing students from underrepresented groups with the financial assistance they need to attend university and succeed in their studies.

It's important to note that while grants can provide many benefits to university students, they are not a panacea. The cost of a university education is still high, and it may not be possible for the government to provide grants to all students. However, the government can prioritize grants for students who are most in need, such as those from lower-income families, students from underrepresented groups, and students who are pursuing fields that are critical to the nation's workforce.

In conclusion, financing a university education is a significant financial burden for many students and their families. The cost of tuition, books, and living expenses can be substantial, and many students are forced to take out loans to pay for their education. However, this essay has argued that university students should be given grants, not loans, to finance their studies. Grants can help to reduce the financial burden on students and their families, promote social mobility, promote diversity and inclusivity in higher education and do not have to be repaid. While it may not be possible for the government to provide grants to all students, it can prioritize grants for students who are most in need.",1
643,5010.a2.txt,Should the US bomb Afghanistan?,"The question of whether the United States should bomb Afghanistan is a complex and controversial one that has been debated for many years. In order to make a decision on whether bombing is the right course of action, it is important to consider the reasons for the bombing, the potential benefits and drawbacks, and the potential impact on both the people of Afghanistan and the United States.

One of the main reasons that the United States has considered bombing Afghanistan is to target terrorist groups that operate in the region. Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States launched a military campaign in Afghanistan to remove the Taliban from power and to disrupt the operations of al-Qaeda, which was responsible for the attacks. The goal of this campaign was to disrupt and dismantle the terrorist network that operated in Afghanistan and to prevent future attacks on the United States.

There are several potential benefits to bombing Afghanistan. One of the most significant is that it could disrupt and dismantle terrorist networks that operate in the region, making it more difficult for them to plan and carry out attacks against the United States and other countries. Additionally, bombing could also help to weaken the Taliban and other extremist groups, making it more difficult for them to maintain control over the country and to provide a safe haven for terrorists.

However, there are also significant drawbacks to bombing Afghanistan. One of the most significant is that it would likely lead to civilian casualties, which could further destabilize the region and create a backlash against the United States. Additionally, bombing could also lead to the displacement of civilians and further destruction of infrastructure, which could make it more difficult for the Afghan people to rebuild and recover after the conflict.

Another major drawback of bombing is that it could further fuel anti-American sentiment, especially if the bombing causes civilian casualties. This could lead to more support for extremist groups and terrorist organizations, making it harder for the US to achieve its objectives. Furthermore, bombing could also lead to further destabilization of the region, making it more difficult for the US and its allies to achieve long-term security and stability in the region.

Ultimately, the decision of whether to bomb Afghanistan is a complex one that requires careful consideration of the potential benefits and drawbacks. While bombing could potentially disrupt and dismantle terrorist networks and weaken extremist groups, it could also lead to significant civilian casualties and further destabilization of the region. Additionally, bombing could further fuel anti-American sentiment and make it harder for the US to achieve its objectives in the region. Therefore, before making a decision on whether to bomb Afghanistan, it is important to weigh all of the potential consequences and to consider alternative options that may be more effective in achieving long-term security and stability in the region.",1
644,5011.a2.txt,"Is it necessary to have a monarchy in Sweden? Do we need the King, the Queen and the whole Royal family? Isn't it hopelessly old-fashioned to inherit a title and an occupation like the kings and the queens do and doesn't all that belong to the past? It is rather easy to answer yes to these questions and to find counter arguments for the monarchy but nevertheless I'm definitely for it.","The question of whether it is necessary to have a monarchy in Sweden is a complex and nuanced one that has been debated for many years. In order to determine whether a monarchy is necessary in Sweden, it is important to consider the historical and cultural significance of the monarchy, the role of the monarchy in contemporary society, and the potential benefits and drawbacks of having a monarchy.

Historically, the monarchy has played an important role in Sweden's cultural and political landscape. The Swedish monarchy has its roots in the 10th century, and for much of its history it was a powerful institution that played a key role in the country's political and cultural development. Throughout the centuries, the Swedish monarchy has been a symbol of continuity and stability, and it has played an important role in shaping the country's identity and culture.

In contemporary society, the Swedish monarchy plays a largely ceremonial role. The King serves as a symbol of national unity, and performs various ceremonial duties such as opening parliament, receiving foreign dignitaries, and representing Sweden in international events. The King does not have any political power, and the country is governed by a parliamentary democracy.

One of the potential benefits of having a monarchy in Sweden is that it serves as a symbol of continuity and stability. The monarchy provides a sense of historical continuity, connecting the present with the past, and serves as a reminder of the country's cultural heritage. Additionally, the monarchy can also serve as a source of national pride and identity, helping to foster a sense of unity among the people.

Another potential benefit of having a monarchy is that it can provide a sense of continuity and stability in times of political uncertainty. The monarchy can serve as a non-partisan figurehead that can help to provide a sense of continuity and stability during times of political turmoil or change.

However, there are also several potential drawbacks to having a monarchy in Sweden. One of the most significant is that it can be seen as anachronistic and out of touch with contemporary society. Some argue that the monarchy is a relic of the past that is no longer relevant in modern society, and that the country would be better off without it.

Another potential drawback of having a monarchy is that it can be seen as a symbol of inequality and privilege. The monarchy can be seen as a reminder of the country's aristocratic past, and as a symbol of the privileging of a small, elite group of people over the rest of society.

Additionally, having a monarchy can also be costly. The costs of maintaining the monarchy, including the expenses for the royal family, staff, and the maintenance of royal palaces and other properties, are often seen as a burden on the taxpayers.

In conclusion, whether it is necessary to have a monarchy in Sweden is a complex and nuanced question that depends on one's perspective. While the monarchy has a rich historical and cultural significance, and can serve as a symbol of continuity and stability, it can also be viewed as anachronistic and out of touch with contemporary society. Additionally, the costs of maintaining a monarchy can also be seen as a burden on the taxpayers. Ultimately, the decision of whether to keep the monarchy in Sweden is a matter of personal perspective, cultural values and cost-benefit analysis.",1
645,5012.a2.txt,A healthier approach to life,"A healthier approach to life is one that prioritizes physical, mental, and emotional well-being. This can be achieved through a variety of means, such as regular exercise, a balanced diet, stress management techniques, and a positive attitude.

One of the most important aspects of a healthier approach to life is regular exercise. Exercise not only helps to keep the body in shape, but it also improves cardiovascular health, strengthens the immune system, and can even boost mood and cognitive function. Whether it's through a structured workout program, a team sport, or simply taking a walk, incorporating physical activity into one's daily routine can have a profound positive impact on overall health.

Another key component of a healthier approach to life is a balanced diet. Eating a diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains can help to provide the body with the necessary nutrients it needs to function properly. It's important to pay attention to portion sizes and to limit intake of processed foods, sugary drinks, and saturated fats. Additionally, staying hydrated is important to maintain overall health.

Stress management is also a crucial aspect of a healthier approach to life. Chronic stress can lead to a variety of physical and mental health problems, such as high blood pressure, anxiety, and depression. Finding healthy ways to manage stress, such as through meditation, yoga, journaling, or talking to a therapist, can help to keep stress levels in check and promote overall well-being.

Having a positive attitude can also go a long way in promoting a healthier approach to life. Cultivating a positive mindset can help to improve mood, reduce stress, and even improve physical health. This can be achieved through practices such as gratitude journaling, practicing mindfulness, or simply surrounding oneself with positive and supportive people.

In summary, a healthier approach to life is one that prioritizes physical, mental, and emotional well-being. This can be achieved through regular exercise, a balanced diet, stress management techniques, and a positive attitude. By making these things a priority, one can improve overall health and live a happier and more fulfilling life.",1
646,5013.a2.txt,MORE WOMENSOCCER IN MEDIA!,"The representation of women's soccer in media is a topic that has been gaining attention in recent years. Despite the growing popularity and success of the sport, women's soccer is still underrepresented in the media compared to men's soccer. This lack of representation has significant consequences for the sport and its players, as well as for young girls and women who look to media to see role models and opportunities to participate in sports.

One of the main reasons for the lack of representation of women's soccer in media is the disparity in funding and resources between men's and women's soccer. This is evident in the fact that the prize money for the men's World Cup is significantly higher than that for the women's World Cup, and that men's soccer teams often have larger budgets and more resources than women's teams. This disparity in funding and resources is reflected in the media coverage of the sport, with men's soccer receiving far more coverage and attention than women's soccer.

Another reason for the lack of representation of women's soccer in media is the widespread belief that men's soccer is more exciting and competitive than women's soccer. This belief is perpetuated by media outlets, which often focus on men's soccer and give less coverage to women's soccer. This lack of coverage means that many people are not aware of the high level of skill, athleticism, and competitiveness that exists in women's soccer.

The underrepresentation of women's soccer in media also has significant consequences for the sport and its players. Without adequate media coverage, many people are not aware of the achievements and successes of women's soccer teams and players, which can make it more difficult for these teams and players to attract sponsors and supporters. Additionally, the lack of representation in media means that many young girls and women may not see role models or opportunities to participate in the sport, which can limit the growth and development of women's soccer.

To address the underrepresentation of women's soccer in media, there needs to be a concerted effort to increase funding and resources for the sport, as well as to change the perception of women's soccer as less exciting and competitive than men's soccer. This can be achieved through a variety of means, such as by increasing media coverage of women's soccer, promoting the achievements and successes of women's soccer teams and players, and providing more opportunities for young girls and women to participate in the sport.

One way to increase media coverage of women's soccer is through partnerships between media outlets and women's soccer organizations. This can involve media outlets providing more coverage and coverage of women's soccer events and matches, as well as working with women's soccer organizations to create content that highlights the achievements and successes of women's soccer teams and players. Additionally, media outlets can work with women's soccer organizations to provide more opportunities for young girls and women to participate in the sport, such as by providing coverage of youth and amateur women's soccer leagues and tournaments.

Another way to increase media coverage of women's soccer is through the use of social media platforms. Social media platforms can be used to promote women's soccer and to provide more opportunities for young girls and women to participate in the sport. Social media platforms can be used to create content that highlights the achievements and successes of women's soccer teams and players, as well as to provide more opportunities for young girls and women to participate in the sport. Additionally, social media platforms can be used to provide more opportunities for young girls and women to participate in the sport by providing coverage of youth and amateur women's soccer leagues and tournaments.

647,5014.a2.txt,Down with the King,"""Down with the King"" is a phrase that has been used throughout history to call for the overthrow or removal of a monarchy or ruling monarch. The reasons for this sentiment can vary, but often include issues such as corruption, abuse of power, and lack of representation for the people.

One of the earliest examples of this phrase being used is in the biblical story of King Saul in the Old Testament. Saul, the first king of Israel, was chosen by God to lead the Israelites but eventually lost favor with God and the people due to his disobedience and pride. The prophet Samuel was sent by God to anoint David, a young shepherd, as the next king, and the people cried out ""Down with the King!"" as Saul's rule came to an end.

Another historical example is the French Revolution, which began in 1789 and led to the downfall of the French monarchy. The people of France were fed up with the high taxes and economic crisis caused by the extravagance of the monarchy, and they began to call for the end of the monarchy and the establishment of a republic. The famous phrase ""Liberté, égalité, fraternité"" (liberty, equality, fraternity) became a rallying cry for the revolution, and the monarchy was eventually abolished in 1792.

Similarly, the phrase ""Down with the King"" was also used during the Russian Revolution of 1917. The people of Russia were tired of the Tsar's autocratic rule and the country's involvement in World War I. They began to call for an end to the monarchy and for a government that would better serve the needs of the people. The Tsar was overthrown and the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic was established.

In modern times, the phrase ""Down with the King"" is often used in a metaphorical sense, referring to the overthrow or removal of any powerful or oppressive figure or institution. This can be seen in the recent protests against police brutality and racial injustice, where people are calling for an end to systemic racism and the establishment of a more just and equitable society.

It is worth noting that while the phrase ""Down with the King"" can be used to call for change and progress, it should not be used to justify violence or harmful actions towards any individual or group. The goal should always be to create a better and more just society through peaceful means.

In conclusion, the phrase ""Down with the King"" has been used throughout history to call for the overthrow or removal of a monarchy or ruling monarch. The reasons for this sentiment can vary, but often include issues such as corruption, abuse of power, and lack of representation for the people. It has been used in both literal and metaphorical senses, and it is important to remember that while it can be used as a call for change and progress, it should not be used to justify violence or harmful actions towards any individual or group. The goal should always be to create a better and more just society through peaceful means.",1
648,5016.a2.txt,Allow homosexuals to adopt children,"The issue of whether or not homosexuals should be allowed to adopt children has been a topic of debate for many years. On one hand, supporters argue that same-sex couples are just as capable of providing a loving and nurturing home for a child as opposite-sex couples. On the other hand, opponents argue that children need a mother and a father in order to have a healthy upbringing.

One of the main arguments in favor of allowing homosexuals to adopt children is that there are many children in need of loving homes. According to the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System, there were over 400,000 children in the foster care system in the United States in 2019. Many of these children have been removed from their homes due to abuse or neglect, and they need a stable and loving environment in which to grow up. Allowing same-sex couples to adopt would increase the number of available homes for these children and give them the opportunity to have a family.

Another argument in favor of allowing homosexuals to adopt is that same-sex couples are just as capable of providing a loving and nurturing home for a child as opposite-sex couples. Studies have shown that children raised by same-sex couples are just as well-adjusted as those raised by opposite-sex couples. They have similar levels of self-esteem, academic achievement, and social skills. Furthermore, children raised by same-sex couples are no more likely to be gay or lesbian than those raised by opposite-sex couples.

Opponents of same-sex adoption argue that children need a mother and a father in order to have a healthy upbringing. They argue that children need both a male and a female role model in order to learn about gender roles and relationships. However, studies have shown that children do not need both a mother and a father in order to have a healthy upbringing. Children can learn about gender roles and relationships from a variety of sources, such as teachers, coaches, and other family members.

Another argument against same-sex adoption is that it goes against traditional family values. However, society's views on family and parenting have changed over time, and what was once considered traditional is now considered outdated. Furthermore, allowing same-sex couples to adopt is not a threat to traditional families, it simply expands the definition of a family to include more diverse types of loving homes.

It is also worth noting that many countries and states have legalized same-sex adoption. In the United States, for example, same-sex adoption is legal in all 50 states, and several countries such as Canada, Spain, and the Netherlands have also legalized it.

In conclusion, allowing homosexuals to adopt children is a complex issue with valid arguments on both sides. However, the evidence suggests that same-sex couples are just as capable of providing a loving and nurturing home for a child as opposite-sex couples. Furthermore, with thousands of children in need of loving homes, it is important to open up the pool of potential adoptive parents to include same-sex couples. Allowing same-sex couples to adopt would increase the number of available homes for these children and give them the opportunity to have a family, while also helping to break down outdated stereotypes and expand the definition of a family.",1
649,5017.a2.txt,Fruit is evil,"The statement ""Fruit is evil"" is not a scientifically or nutritionally supported claim. Fruits, like all foods, have certain properties that can be beneficial or detrimental depending on how they are consumed and in what quantity. However, fruits are generally considered to be a healthy and important part of a balanced diet.

Fruits are a good source of vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, potassium, and folate. They are also a good source of dietary fiber, which can help with digestion and weight management. Eating fruits can also reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and certain types of cancer. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables can lower the risk of dying from heart disease by 31%, and lower the risk of dying from stroke by 26%.

Fruits also contain antioxidants, which help to protect the body against damage from free radicals. Free radicals are molecules that can cause damage to cells, leading to inflammation and the development of chronic diseases. Antioxidants, such as those found in fruits, help to neutralize free radicals and protect the body from their harmful effects.

Furthermore, fruits contain natural sugars and are low in calories, so they can be a healthy and satisfying alternative to processed and sugary snacks. Eating fruits as a snack or dessert can help to satisfy a sweet tooth without consuming added sugars and empty calories.

It is worth noting that some fruits contain higher levels of natural sugars than others, and consuming too much of these fruits can lead to weight gain and other health issues. However, this does not make fruits ""evil."" It is all about moderation, balance, and paying attention to the nutrient density of the fruits you consume.

Additionally, some people may have allergies or sensitivities to certain fruits, which can lead to negative effects when consuming them. However, this does not make fruit as a whole ""evil."" It is just a matter of being mindful of one's dietary needs and limitations.

In conclusion, the statement ""Fruit is evil"" is not a scientifically or nutritionally supported claim. Fruits are a healthy and important part of a balanced diet. They provide essential vitamins and minerals, dietary fiber, antioxidants, and can help to reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Eating fruits in moderation can help to satisfy a sweet tooth without consuming added sugars and empty calories. However, it is important to keep in mind that some fruits contain higher levels of natural sugars than others, and consuming too much of these fruits can lead to weight gain and other health issues. Additionally, some people may have allergies or sensitivities to certain fruits, which can lead to negative effects when consuming them. But overall, fruits are a vital part of a healthy diet and should not be labeled as ""evil.""",1
650,5018.a2.txt,It isn't all about laughs,"The idea that ""it isn't all about laughs"" suggests that there is more to life than just having a good time and laughing. While laughter and humor can certainly be an important part of our lives, there are also many other aspects of life that are just as important, if not more so.

One important aspect of life that is often overlooked in the pursuit of laughter is the importance of emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to recognize, understand, and manage our own emotions, as well as the emotions of others. It is a critical skill that can help us to build and maintain healthy relationships, make sound decisions, and achieve our goals. Emotional intelligence also enables us to be more resilient in the face of adversity, to cope with stress, and to be more self-aware.

Another important aspect of life is personal growth and self-development. Life is not just about getting by, but about constantly striving to become the best version of ourselves. This requires a willingness to learn, to challenge ourselves, and to take risks. Personal growth and self-development can be challenging, but it is also incredibly rewarding. It can help us to achieve our goals, to find meaning and purpose in our lives, and to feel fulfilled.

Another important aspect of life is giving back to others. Whether it is through volunteering, donating, or simply being kind to others, giving back to others can be incredibly rewarding. It can help us to feel connected to others, to make a positive impact in the world, and to find a sense of purpose and meaning in our lives.

Lastly, the importance of having a sense of balance in life is crucial. While it is important to have fun and enjoy ourselves, it is also important to strike a balance between different aspects of our lives, such as work and play, and to take care of our physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Achieving a balance in life is not always easy, but it is essential for our overall well-being.

In conclusion, while laughter and humor can certainly be an important part of our lives, it is important to remember that there is more to life than just having a good time. Emotional intelligence, personal growth and self-development, giving back to others, and having a sense of balance in life are all just as important, if not more so. By focusing on these important aspects of life, we can not only improve the quality of our lives but also contribute to the well-being of others and the world at large.",1
651,5021.a2.txt,Laboratory Convicts,"Laboratory convicts, also known as prison inmates used as research subjects, have been a controversial topic for decades. The use of prison inmates as research subjects has been justified on the grounds that they are a readily available population for studies, and that the knowledge gained from these studies can benefit society as a whole. However, many ethical concerns have been raised about the use of prison inmates in research, including issues related to informed consent, exploitation, and the protection of vulnerable populations.

One of the main concerns related to the use of prison inmates as research subjects is the issue of informed consent. In order for research to be considered ethical, participants must be fully informed about the risks and benefits of the study, and must voluntarily agree to participate. However, many argue that prison inmates may not be able to provide truly informed consent, as they may feel pressure to participate in studies due to their vulnerable status as prisoners, or may not fully understand the risks and benefits of the research. Additionally, prison inmates may not have the same level of autonomy as non-incarcerated individuals, and may not be able to make fully informed decisions about participating in research.

Another concern related to the use of prison inmates as research subjects is the issue of exploitation. Some argue that prison inmates are being used as ""guinea pigs"" for research, and that they are being taken advantage of due to their vulnerable status as prisoners. Additionally, prison inmates may not have the same access to healthcare and other resources as non-incarcerated individuals, and may be more likely to be exposed to harmful or risky research.

The issue of exploitation is further complicated by the fact that many prison inmates are from marginalized communities, and may be at a higher risk of being taken advantage of in research. This includes individuals from low-income communities, communities of color, and individuals with mental health or other vulnerabilities.

In addition to these ethical concerns, there are also concerns related to the protection of vulnerable populations. For example, prison inmates may be more likely to be exposed to harmful or risky research due to their vulnerable status as prisoners, and may not have the same access to healthcare and other resources as non-incarcerated individuals. Additionally, some argue that the use of prison inmates as research subjects could have negative consequences for the individuals involved, as well as for the broader prison population.

Despite these concerns, many argue that the use of prison inmates as research subjects can be ethical, if proper safeguards and protections are in place. For example, some argue that prison inmates should only be used in research that is directly related to their health and well-being, and that the research should be conducted in a way that is respectful of the individuals involved. Additionally, some argue that prison inmates should be compensated for their participation in research, in order to address concerns related to exploitation.

One way to address these ethical concerns is through the implementation of Institutional Review Boards (IRBs). IRBs are responsible for reviewing and approving research studies, and ensuring that they are ethical and comply with all relevant regulations. IRBs can also provide oversight and ensure that the rights and welfare of the research participants are protected.

In conclusion, the use of prison inmates as research subjects is a complex and controversial topic, with valid ethical concerns such as exploitation, informed consent, and protecting vulnerable populations. While some argue that the use of prison inmates in research can be ethical, it is crucial that proper safeguards and protections are in place to ensure that the rights and welfare of the research participants are protected. It's important that institutional review boards are implemented to review and approve research studies, and ensure that they are ethical and comply with all relevant regulations. Ultimately, the decision to use prison inmates as research subjects should be based on a careful weighing of the potential",1
652,5022.a2.txt,The end of the monarchy,"The end of the monarchy, or the abolition of the institution of a hereditary monarchy, has been a topic of debate for centuries. Some argue that the monarchy is a symbol of tradition and continuity, and that it plays an important role in providing stability and continuity in the government. Others argue that the monarchy is an outdated and unnecessary institution, and that it serves as a symbol of privilege and inequality.

One of the main arguments for the end of the monarchy is that it is an outdated and unnecessary institution. In many countries, the monarchy is seen as a relic of the past, and no longer serves a meaningful purpose in the government. Some argue that the monarchy is a symbol of privilege and inequality, and that it perpetuates the idea that certain individuals are born into power and privilege, while others are not. Additionally, many argue that the monarchy is a drain on public resources, as it requires significant funding to maintain the royal family and their various palaces, estates and other costly ventures.

Another argument for the end of the monarchy is that it is undemocratic. In a true democracy, all citizens have an equal say in the government, and power is derived from the people. However, in a monarchy, power is inherited and not elected, which goes against the principles of democracy. Furthermore, many argue that the monarchy is a barrier to true political representation and accountability, as the monarchy is not accountable to the people and is not subject to democratic oversight.

However, there are also arguments in favor of the monarchy. One of the main arguments is that the monarchy is a symbol of tradition and continuity, and that it plays an important role in providing stability and continuity in the government. Many argue that the monarchy is a unifying force in society, and that it helps to bring people together, especially in times of crisis. Additionally, some argue that the monarchy serves as a symbol of national identity, and that it is an important part of a country's cultural heritage.

Another argument in favor of the monarchy is that it serves as a check on the power of the government. In a monarchy, the monarch serves as a symbolic head of state, and is not involved in the day-to-day operations of the government. However, the monarch does have the power to intervene in government affairs in certain situations, such as in the event of a constitutional crisis. This serves as a check on the power of the government, and helps to ensure that the government is accountable to the people.

Despite these arguments, there are many countries that have abolished the monarchy in recent years. For example, in the 20th century, several countries in Europe, including Russia, Germany, and Austria, abolished their monarchies. Additionally, countries in Latin America, such as Mexico and Cuba, also abolished their monarchies during this time.

In conclusion, the end of the monarchy is a complex and controversial topic, with valid arguments on both sides. Some argue that the monarchy is an outdated and unnecessary institution, while others argue that it plays an important role in providing stability and continuity in the government. However, many countries have abolished the monarchy in recent years, and the trend towards the abolition of the monarchy may continue in the future. Ultimately, whether or not to abolish the monarchy is a decision that must be made by each country and its people, taking into account their own unique circumstances, history and cultural heritage.",1
653,5023.a2.txt,ABOLISH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT!,"Capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, is the legal process by which a person is put to death as a punishment for a crime. The use of capital punishment has been a contentious issue for many years, with some arguing for its abolition and others arguing for its continued use. In this essay, I will argue that capital punishment should be abolished because it is inhumane, ineffective, and violates the right to life.

One of the main arguments against capital punishment is that it is inhumane. The death penalty is a brutal and violent act that causes unnecessary suffering to the person being executed, as well as to the family and loved ones of the person. Additionally, the death penalty is often carried out in a way that is cruel and inhumane, such as through lethal injection or electrocution. Furthermore, there is also the possibility of executing an innocent person, which would be a grave injustice.

Another argument against capital punishment is that it is ineffective as a deterrent. Studies have shown that the death penalty does not deter crime more effectively than other forms of punishment, such as life imprisonment. Additionally, the death penalty is often applied disproportionately to marginalized communities, such as people of color, the poor, and people with mental health issues. This is not only unjust but also ineffective in addressing the root causes of crime.

Moreover, capital punishment violates the right to life, which is considered a fundamental human right and protected by international law. The death penalty is a form of state-sanctioned killing, which is morally and legally unjustifiable. The state should not have the power to take away a person's life, and death penalty undermines the principle of human dignity and the right to live.

There are also practical issues with the death penalty. The process of appeals and the need for multiple trials in capital punishment cases are often long and costly. In many cases, the appeals process can take years, and it can cost a significant amount of money to retry a case. In contrast, life imprisonment without parole is both cheaper and more efficient.

Furthermore, capital punishment has been abolished in many countries around the world, including many developed countries. This trend towards the abolition of capital punishment is an indication that it is no longer considered a viable or appropriate form of punishment.

In conclusion, capital punishment should be abolished because it is inhumane, ineffective, and violates the right to life. Capital punishment is a brutal and violent act that causes unnecessary suffering, and it is not an effective deterrent to crime. Additionally, capital punishment undermines the principle of human dignity and the right to live. Moreover, there are also practical issues with the death penalty such as the long and costly appeals process. The trend towards the abolition of capital punishment is an indication that it is no longer considered a viable or appropriate form of punishment. It's important to consider alternative forms of punishment that are more effective, humane and in line with human rights principles.",1
654,5024.a2.txt,Long live the Majesty!,"Long live the Majesty is a phrase that is often used to express loyalty and support for a monarchy, and the reigning monarch. The monarchy is an institution that has been in existence for centuries, and it continues to play an important role in many countries around the world. In this essay, I will argue that the monarchy is an important institution that should be preserved and celebrated for its historical significance, cultural value, and symbolic role in the government.

One of the main arguments in favor of the monarchy is that it is a symbol of historical continuity and tradition. The monarchy is an institution that has been in existence for centuries, and it represents the continuity of a country's history and culture. Monarchs often serve as symbols of national identity, and they help to bring people together, especially in times of crisis. Additionally, the monarchy is often associated with cultural and ceremonial traditions, such as coronations, royal weddings, and other state ceremonies, which helps to add richness and diversity to the cultural heritage of a country.

Another argument in favor of the monarchy is that it serves as a symbol of stability and continuity in the government. The monarchy is often seen as a unifying force in society, and it helps to provide a sense of continuity and stability in the government. The monarchy can also serve as a check on the power of the government, ensuring that the government is accountable to the people. Furthermore, the monarchy is not subject to the same political pressures as elected officials, which allows it to act as an independent and impartial arbiter in times of crisis.

Additionally, the monarchy can serve as a source of inspiration and a focus for national pride. Monarchs often represent the best of their country and can serve as role models for the people, promoting virtues such as duty, honor, and service. This can be particularly important for younger generations, who may not have lived through significant historical events. In this way, the monarchy can help to foster a sense of national pride and identity.

Moreover, the monarchy also plays an important role in the tourism industry, with many people visiting countries specifically to see the royal palaces, castles and other historical sites associated with the monarchy. This can be a significant source of revenue for a country, and it can help to create jobs and boost the economy.

Furthermore, the monarchy is often seen as a symbol of unity and continuity, especially in countries with a history of political turmoil. The monarchy can serve as a symbol of continuity and stability, helping to bring people together and provide a sense of national identity and unity.

In conclusion, the monarchy is an important institution that should be preserved and celebrated for its historical significance, cultural value, and symbolic role in the government. The monarchy is a symbol of historical continuity and tradition, serves as a symbol of stability and continuity in the government, and serves as a source of inspiration and a focus for national pride. Additionally, the monarchy plays an important role in the tourism industry, and in countries with a history of political turmoil it can serve as a symbol of unity and continuity. The monarchy is an important part of a country's cultural heritage and it's important to recognize and appreciate its contributions to the society.",1
655,5025.a2.txt,There is no place for a monarchy in a democratic country like Sweden,"The monarchy is an institution that has been a part of many countries for centuries, but there is growing debate about whether or not it has a place in a democratic country like Sweden. In this essay, I will argue that there is no place for a monarchy in a democratic country like Sweden because it is an outdated and unnecessary institution, it undermines the principles of democracy, and it perpetuates privilege and inequality.

One of the main arguments against the monarchy in a democratic country like Sweden is that it is an outdated and unnecessary institution. In a democracy, power is derived from the people and all citizens have an equal say in the government. The monarchy, on the other hand, is a hereditary institution in which power is passed down through a royal family, and it undermines the principles of democracy. The monarchy is seen as a symbol of the past, and it no longer serves a meaningful purpose in modern society.

Another argument against the monarchy in a democratic country like Sweden is that it undermines the principles of democracy. In a democracy, all citizens have equal rights and opportunities, and power is held accountable to the people through regular elections. The monarchy, on the other hand, is not accountable to the people, and it is not subject to democratic oversight. The monarchy is a symbol of privilege and inequality, which goes against the principles of democracy.

Moreover, the monarchy perpetuates privilege and inequality. The monarchy is often associated with wealth and power, and it creates a class system in which certain individuals are born into privilege and power, while others are not. This is not only unjust but also undermines the principles of equality and fairness, which are the core values of democracy.

Additionally, the monarchy is a significant cost to the taxpayers. The monarchy requires significant funding to maintain the royal family, palaces, and other costly ventures, and these funds could be better allocated to public services such as healthcare and education.

Furthermore, there are many democratic countries that have abolished the monarchy, such as France and Ireland, which have transitioned to a republic. This trend towards the abolition of the monarchy is an indication that it is no longer considered a viable or appropriate form of government in a democratic society.

In conclusion, there is no place for a monarchy in a democratic country like Sweden. The monarchy is an outdated and unnecessary institution that undermines the principles of democracy, perpetuates privilege and inequality, and is a significant cost to the taxpayers.

656,5026.a2.txt,Make English the 'lingua franca' of the European Union.,"The European Union is made up of 27 member states, each with their own official languages. While this diversity of languages is a source of cultural richness, it can also be a source of communication barriers and difficulties. To overcome these barriers, many argue that English should be made the ""lingua franca"" of the European Union. In this essay, I will argue that making English the lingua franca of the European Union would improve communication and cooperation among EU member states and would be beneficial for the EU as a whole.

One of the main arguments for making English the lingua franca of the European Union is that it would improve communication and cooperation among member states. The EU is an intergovernmental organization that requires regular communication and collaboration among member states in order to function effectively. By making English the lingua franca, member states would be able to communicate more easily and efficiently, which would facilitate cooperation and coordination. This would be particularly beneficial for the EU institutions such as the European Commission, the Council of the European Union, and the European Parliament, which frequently need to communicate with member states.

Another argument for making English the lingua franca is that it would be beneficial for the EU's economy. English is widely spoken and understood around the world, making it a valuable language for international trade and commerce. By making English the lingua franca of the EU, member states would be able to more easily conduct business and trade with non-EU countries, which would be beneficial for the EU's economy as a whole. Additionally, it would also be beneficial for the EU's businesses and entrepreneurs, as they would be able to communicate more easily with clients and partners around the world.

Additionally, making English the lingua franca would make it easier for citizens of EU member states to work and travel within the EU. English is widely spoken and understood around the world, and by making it the lingua franca of the EU, citizens would be able to communicate more easily with people from other member states. This would be particularly beneficial for young people and students, as it would make it easier for them to study and work abroad.

Furthermore, making English the lingua franca would make it easier for non-EU citizens to communicate with the EU. English is widely spoken and understood around the world, and by making it the lingua franca of the EU, non-EU citizens would be able to communicate more easily with EU institutions and member states. This would be beneficial for the EU's relations with non-EU countries, and it would make it easier for non-EU citizens to work and study in the EU.

There are also concerns that making English the lingua franca of the EU would be detrimental to the preservation of other languages within the EU. However, it's important to note that making English the lingua franca does not mean that other languages should not be used or studied. It just means that in official communication, it would be easier for people to communicate in English, which is already widely spoken.

In conclusion, making English the lingua franca of the European Union would improve communication and cooperation among EU",1
657,5027.a2.txt,Give the elderly a decent treatment,"The elderly are a vital part of society, yet they often face discrimination and mistreatment. This is particularly true in long-term care facilities, where neglect and abuse are all too common. In this essay, I will argue that the elderly deserve a decent treatment and that steps must be taken to ensure that they receive the care and respect they deserve.

One of the main arguments for giving the elderly a decent treatment is that they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. The elderly have lived full lives and have made significant contributions to society. They deserve to be treated with the same dignity and respect as any other member of society, regardless of their age. This includes being treated with kindness, understanding, and compassion, as well as being given the opportunity to live their remaining years with as much autonomy and independence as possible.

Another argument for giving the elderly a decent treatment is that it is the right thing to do. The elderly are vulnerable and often rely on others for their care and well-being. It is the moral responsibility of society to ensure that they are treated with respect and given the care they need. Neglect and abuse of the elderly is not only morally wrong but also illegal, and society has a responsibility to protect the elderly from harm.

Moreover, giving the elderly a decent treatment will benefit society as a whole. The elderly are an important part of society and contribute to its richness and diversity. They have a wealth of knowledge and experience to offer, and society can benefit from their contributions. When the elderly are treated with respect and given the care they need, they are more likely to be active members of society, and they are more likely to pass on their knowledge and experience to future generations.

Additionally, giving the elderly a decent treatment will benefit the economy. The elderly are often dependent on pensions, social security and other forms of government assistance, which can be costly for society. By ensuring that the elderly are treated with respect and given the care they need, they are less likely to become a burden on society and the economy.

Furthermore, giving the elderly a decent treatment is a collective responsibility. It's the responsibility of society, government and the families to ensure that the elderly are treated with respect and given the care they need. The government has the responsibility to ensure that laws and regulations are in place to protect the elderly from neglect and abuse. Families have the responsibility to ensure that their elderly members are treated with respect and given the care they need, and society has the responsibility to promote a culture of respect and care for the elderly.

In conclusion, giving the elderly a decent treatment is essential for ensuring that they are treated with dignity and respect. The elderly deserve to be treated with the same dignity and respect as any other member of society, and steps must be taken to ensure that they receive the care and respect they deserve. Neglect and abuse of the elderly is not only morally wrong but also illegal, and society has a responsibility to protect the elderly from harm. Furthermore, giving the elderly a decent treatment will benefit society as a whole and the economy, and it's a collective responsibility of society, government and the families.",1

The EU has been successful in achieving these goals, and many argue that it represents a model for the world to follow in the pursuit of peace. In this essay, I will argue that the EU is the world's chance for peace and that its principles and practices can serve as a blueprint for achieving peace and stability around the world.

One of the main arguments for the EU as the world's chance for peace is that it has been successful in promoting peace and stability in Europe. The EU has been able to achieve this through the implementation of a number of policies and institutions, such as the single market, the euro currency, and the European Court of Justice. These policies and institutions have helped to promote cooperation and integration among member states, which has led to a decrease in the likelihood of conflict within Europe. Additionally, the EU has been able to achieve this through the promotion of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, which are essential elements in maintaining peace and stability.

Another argument for the EU as the world's chance for peace is that it serves as a model for the world to follow. The EU's approach to peace and stability is based on the principles of cooperation, integration, and dialogue. These principles can be applied to other regions of the world and can help to promote peace and stability there as well. Furthermore, the EU's institutions, such as the European Commission, the Council of the European Union, and the European Parliament, serve as examples for other regions to follow in terms of governance and decision-making.

Moreover, the EU's approach to peace and stability is based on the idea of shared responsibility. This means that member states work together to achieve common goals and to address common challenges. This approach can be applied to other regions of the world and can help to promote cooperation and collaboration in the pursuit of peace and stability.

Additionally, the EU's approach to peace and stability is based on the idea of ""soft power."" This means that the EU uses non-violent means, such as diplomacy and economic incentives, to promote peace and stability. This approach can be applied to other regions of the world and can help to promote peace and stability without the need for military intervention.

Furthermore, the EU has been successful in promoting peace and stability in Europe and can serve as a model for the world to follow, it also has the potential to strengthen the role of the United Nations. The EU's approach to peace and stability is based on the principles of the United Nations Charter, such as respect for human rights and the rule of law, and the EU's actions can contribute to the effectiveness of the UN in maintaining international peace and security.

In conclusion, the EU is the world's chance for peace. It has been successful in promoting peace and stability in Europe through the implementation of policies and institutions that promote cooperation and integration among member states. Additionally, the EU's approach to peace and stability, which is based on the principles of cooperation, integration, dialogue, shared responsibility, and soft power, can serve as a model for the world to follow in the pursuit of peace and stability.

However, in recent years, there has been a growing debate about whether or not the monarchy is still relevant in modern society. In this essay, I will argue that monarchy is an archaic tradition that has outlived its usefulness and should be abolished.

One of the main arguments against the monarchy is that it is an outdated and unnecessary institution. In modern society, power is derived from the people through democratic means such as elections. The monarchy, on the other hand, is a hereditary institution in which power is passed down through a royal family. This undermines the principles of democracy and equality and is no longer relevant in a society that values fairness, and political accountability.

661,5031.a2.txt,"""Equal rights for women to wear lounge suits""","Equal rights for women to wear lounge suits is a topic that has been gaining increasing attention in recent years. Lounge suits are a type of formal attire that are traditionally worn by men and are considered to be more masculine. However, women have been advocating for the right to wear lounge suits in formal settings, arguing that they should have the same rights as men to wear clothing that they feel comfortable and confident in. In this essay, I will argue that women should have the right to wear lounge suits and that this is an important step towards achieving gender equality.

One of the main arguments for equal rights for women to wear lounge suits is that it promotes gender equality. Gender equality is the idea that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities, regardless of their gender. Allowing women to wear lounge suits in formal settings is an important step towards achieving gender equality, as it recognizes that women should have the same rights as men to wear clothing that they feel comfortable and confident in. This is particularly important in professional settings, where women should be able to dress in a way that is appropriate for their profession, rather than being restricted by traditional gender roles.

Another argument for equal rights for women to wear lounge suits is that it promotes self-expression and individuality. Clothing is an important form of self-expression, and it is important for individuals to be able to express themselves in a way that makes them feel comfortable and confident. Allowing women to wear lounge suits in formal settings will give them the opportunity to express themselves in a way that is appropriate for their profession, rather than being restricted by traditional gender roles.

Moreover, equal rights for women to wear lounge suits is also an important step towards breaking down stereotypes and challenging societal norms. The traditional view of lounge suits as a masculine attire is a stereotype that reinforces the idea that women should dress and behave in a certain way. Allowing women to wear lounge suits in formal settings challenges this stereotype and helps to break down societal norms that limit women's choices.

Additionally, the fashion industry and society in general is changing and evolving, and it's important for the laws and regulations to keep up with these changes. The traditional gender roles are becoming less rigid, and more people are pushing the boundaries and challenging the status quo. Allowing women to wear lounge suits in formal settings is a reflection of this trend and it will help to bring the laws and regulations in line with the changing societal norms.

In conclusion, equal rights for women to wear lounge suits is an important step towards achieving gender equality, promoting self-expression and individuality, breaking down stereotypes and challenging societal norms. It's time for society to recognize that women should have the same rights as men to wear clothing that they feel comfortable and confident in, particularly in professional settings. Allowing women to wear lounge suits in formal settings will help to promote a more equal and inclusive society, where individuals are free to express themselves in a way that is appropriate for their profession, regardless of their gender.",1
662,5032.a2.txt,Death Penalty - Legalized Murder,"The death penalty, also known as capital punishment, is the practice of executing individuals who have been convicted of certain crimes. While the death penalty has been used throughout history as a way to punish criminals, it has been a controversial issue for many years, with some arguing that it is a necessary form of punishment for the most heinous crimes, while others argue that it is a form of legalized murder. In this essay, I will argue that the death penalty is a form of legalized murder and that it should be abolished.

One of the main arguments against the death penalty is that it is a form of legalized murder. The death penalty involves taking the life of an individual, which is a fundamental human right. The state has no right to take away a person's life, as it is considered to be the most severe form of punishment. This is particularly true when there is a chance that the person being executed is innocent, as this would be equivalent to committing murder.

Another argument against the death penalty is that it does not deter crime. Studies have shown that the death penalty is not an effective deterrent for crime. In fact, some studies have shown that the death penalty may even increase crime rates. This is because the death penalty does not address the underlying causes of crime, such as poverty, education, and mental health issues.

Furthermore, the death penalty is often applied in a discriminatory manner. It is disproportionately applied to marginalized groups, such as people of color, people from low-income communities, and people with mental illness. This is a violation of the principle of equality before the law and undermines the justice system.

Additionally, the death penalty is a costly process that diverts resources away from other important issues such as education, healthcare, and poverty. The cost of executing a person is significantly higher than the cost of keeping them in prison for life, and this is a waste of valuable resources that could be used to improve society in other ways.

Moreover, the death penalty is often applied in a flawed system, with many cases of wrongful convictions and exonerations. In this context, the death penalty is not only a form of legalized murder but also a grave injustice, as it can lead to the execution of innocent people. This is particularly true in countries where the justice system is corrupt or weak, where the death penalty is often used as a tool of repression, rather than a form of justice.

In conclusion, the death penalty is a form of legalized murder that should be abolished. It is a violation of the fundamental human right to life, it does not deter crime, and it is applied in a discriminatory and flawed manner. Furthermore, the death penalty is a costly process that diverts resources away from other important issues, and it can lead to the execution of innocent people. The world should move towards alternative forms of punishment that are more effective in addressing the underlying causes of crime and that respect human rights and the principles of justice.",1
663,5033.a2.txt,Swedish students and their education,"Swedish students and their education is a topic of great importance in Sweden. The Swedish education system is known for its emphasis on equality, democracy, and critical thinking. However, in recent years, there have been concerns about the quality of education in Sweden, as well as issues with student engagement and motivation. In this essay, I will explore the current state of Swedish students and their education, highlighting some of the challenges and opportunities that exist in the system.

One of the main challenges facing Swedish students and their education is the issue of student engagement and motivation. According to a report by the Swedish National Agency for Education, many students in Sweden lack motivation to learn and feel disengaged from their studies. This can be attributed to a number of factors, including a lack of individualized instruction, a lack of relevance in the curriculum, and a lack of opportunities for student voice and agency.

Another challenge facing Swedish students and their education is the issue of educational inequality. Despite the emphasis on equality in the Swedish education system, there are significant disparities in educational outcomes between students from different socioeconomic backgrounds. This is particularly true for students from low-income families and immigrant backgrounds, who are more likely to experience educational disadvantage.

Furthermore, there are concerns about the quality of education in Sweden, as well as concerns about the lack of opportunities for students to develop their critical thinking and problem-solving skills. According to a report by the Swedish National Agency for Education, many students in Sweden lack the necessary knowledge and skills to meet the demands of the 21st century. Additionally, there's a problem with students being passive learners and not being encouraged to take an active role in their learning.

However, there are also opportunities for improvement and progress in the Swedish education system. One of the main opportunities is the use of technology in education. The Swedish government has invested heavily in the use of technology in education, and this has the potential to improve student engagement and motivation, as well as to enhance the quality of education. Additionally, the Swedish government has also invested in programs that aim to reduce educational inequality and improve the educational outcomes of students from disadvantaged backgrounds.

Another opportunity is the development of a more student-centered approach to education. This approach emphasizes student voice and agency, as well as the development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This can be achieved by providing students with more opportunities for project-based learning, problem-based learning, and inquiry-based learning.

In conclusion, Swedish students and their education is a topic of great importance in Sweden. While there are challenges facing the education system, such as student engagement and motivation, educational inequality, and concerns about the quality of education, there are also opportunities for improvement and progress. The use of technology in education and the development of a more student-centered approach to education are two examples of opportunities that have the potential to improve the education system in Sweden. It's crucial to address these issues and to continue working towards a more equitable and effective education system that prepares students for the 21st century.",1
664,5034.a2.txt,Credit Cards are bringing financial heartache upon young users,"Credit cards have become an increasingly popular form of payment in recent years, and they are often seen as a convenient way to make purchases and manage finances. However, there is growing concern that credit cards are bringing financial heartache upon young users, who may not be fully aware of the risks and responsibilities associated with using credit. In this essay, I will explore the ways in which credit cards can be detrimental to young users, and why it's important for them to be better informed about the risks of credit card use.

One of the main concerns about credit cards for young users is that they may not fully understand the risks and responsibilities associated with using credit. Young users may not be aware of the high-interest rates and fees that can be associated with credit card use, and they may not be able to repay the debt they accumulate. This can lead to financial difficulties, such as high-interest debt and a poor credit score, which can have long-term consequences for their financial well-being.

Another concern is that credit cards can be a gateway to overspending and financial irresponsibility. Young users may be tempted to make impulsive purchases or to overspend, as credit cards can make it easy to spend money that they do not have. This can lead to a cycle of debt and financial difficulties, which can be difficult to break.

Furthermore, credit cards can also be a source of financial fraud and identity theft. Young users may be vulnerable to fraud and identity theft, as they may not be aware of the risks associated with credit card use, and they may not know how to protect themselves. This can lead to financial losses and damage to their credit score, which can have long-term consequences.

Additionally, many young users may not have a steady income or the financial literacy to manage credit card debt. This can lead to a lack of understanding of the terms and conditions of credit card use, and the potential traps that can come with it. This lack of knowledge can lead to accruing high-interest debt and missing payments, which can damage their credit score and make it harder for them to obtain credit in the future.

In conclusion, credit cards can be a source of financial heartache for young users, who may not fully understand the risks and responsibilities associated with using credit. It's important for young users to be better informed about the risks of credit card use, so they can make informed decisions about whether or not to use credit cards, and how to use them responsibly if they do. This can be achieved through education and financial literacy programs that teach young users about the risks and responsibilities associated with credit card use, and how to manage credit card debt. It's important for young users to be aware of the potential pitfalls of credit card use, and to be cautious when applying for credit.",1
665,5035.a2.txt,Relieve our burden!,"Relieving our burden is a topic that has become increasingly important in recent years, as people are feeling overwhelmed by the demands of daily life. The burden can come in many forms, such as financial stress, work-related stress, and personal stress, and it can have a detrimental effect on our physical and mental well-being. In this essay, I will explore some of the ways in which we can relieve our burden and improve our overall well-being.

One of the most effective ways to relieve our burden is by managing our time more effectively. This can be achieved by setting realistic goals and prioritizing tasks, which can help us to focus on what is truly important. Additionally, it's important to learn to say no to commitments that are not essential and to take time for ourselves to relax and recharge.

Another way to relieve our burden is by managing our finances more effectively. This can be achieved by creating a budget and sticking to it, as well as by reducing our debt and building up savings. Additionally, it's important to be mindful of our spending habits, and to avoid impulse buying or overspending.

Furthermore, it's important to take care of our physical and mental well-being. This can be achieved by exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet, and getting enough sleep. Additionally, it's important to practice self-care, such as meditation, yoga, or journaling, which can help us to manage stress and improve our overall well-being.

Moreover, it's also important to develop a support system. This can be achieved by building strong relationships with friends and family, and by seeking support from professionals if needed. Additionally, it's important to build a strong sense of community, which can provide a sense of belonging and a source of support.

Additionally, it's important to recognize that it's not always possible to relieve our burden, and in such cases it's important to learn how to cope with it. This can be achieved by learning stress management techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness. Additionally, it's important to remember that it's okay to ask for help and to seek support when needed.

In conclusion, relieving our burden is an important step towards improving our overall well-being. This can be achieved by managing our time and finances more effectively, taking care of our physical and mental well-being, developing a support system and learning how to cope with stress.

666,5036.a2.txt,Why students should be given grants - not loans,"The cost of higher education is a significant concern for many students, and the issue of how to finance it is a major factor in the decision to attend college. One of the main options for financing higher education is through student loans, which are a common way for students to pay for their education. However, there is growing concern that student loans are not the best solution for financing higher education, and that students should be given grants instead. In this essay, I will argue that students should be given grants, rather than loans, to finance their higher education.

One of the main reasons why students should be given grants, rather than loans, is that grants do not have to be repaid. This means that students are not burdened with debt after they graduate, which can be a significant financial burden for many students. Additionally, grants can also be used to cover other expenses such as housing, books, and transportation.

Another reason why students should be given grants, rather than loans, is that grants can help to reduce the financial burden for students from low-income families. Many students from low-income families may not be able to afford the cost of higher education without financial assistance, and grants can help to make higher education more accessible for these students. This can help to reduce educational inequality and increase access to higher education for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.

Furthermore, grants can also be used to support students who are pursuing degrees in fields that are in high demand, such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This can help to address the shortage of skilled workers in these fields and to support the development of a highly skilled workforce.

Additionally, giving students grants instead of loans can also have a positive impact on the economy. It can lead to a more educated population that can contribute to the economy by filling in-demand jobs, creating new businesses and paying taxes.

Moreover, grants can also help to reduce the burden of student loan debt, which has become a significant problem in recent years. Many students are struggling to repay their student loans, and this can lead to financial difficulties and a poor credit score. This can also have long-term consequences for their financial well-being, such as making it difficult to buy a home or a car.

In conclusion, students should be given grants, rather than loans, to finance their higher education. Grants do not have to be repaid, which can reduce the financial burden for students after they graduate. Additionally, grants can help to reduce the financial burden for students from low-income families, support students in high-demand fields, have a positive impact on the economy, and reduce the burden of student loan debt. By providing grants to students, we can help to make higher education more accessible and affordable for all, and to support the development of a highly skilled workforce.",1
667,5037.a2.txt,The insanity of monarchy,"Monarchy, the system of government in which a country is ruled by a monarch, is a topic that has been the subject of much debate and controversy. While some argue that monarchy is a traditional and respected form of government, others argue that it is an outdated and unjust system that should be abolished. In this essay, I will argue that monarchy is an insane system of government, and that it should be replaced by a more democratic and fair system of government.

One of the main arguments against monarchy is that it is an outdated and unjust system of government. Monarchy is based on the idea that a single individual, the monarch, has the right to rule over a country and its people. This is an outdated and unjust concept, as it is not based on the principle of equality before the law, and it undermines the idea of democracy.

Another argument against monarchy is that it can be a source of political instability and corruption. Monarchs are often not held accountable for their actions and are not subject to the same checks and balances as elected officials. This can lead to abuse of power, corruption, and the suppression of dissent. Additionally, many monarchies are hereditary and the monarch may not be the best suited to govern, leading to poor decision making and lack of progress.

Furthermore, monarchy can also be a source of economic inequality and poverty. Monarchs often have immense wealth and power, while the majority of the population may live in poverty. This can lead to a lack of economic opportunities and social mobility for the majority of the population, which can contribute to economic inequality and poverty.

Additionally, monarchy can also be a source of cultural suppression. Monarchs often have a significant influence on the culture and society of a country, and they may use this influence to suppress alternative cultures and ideas. This can lead to a lack of diversity and cultural richness in a country, and can have a detrimental effect on the social and cultural well-being of the population.

Moreover, monarchy can also be a source of international conflict and war. Many monarchies have a strong influence on foreign policy, and monarchs may use this influence to pursue their own interests, even if it is at the expense of the country and its people. This can lead to international conflicts and wars, which can have a detrimental effect on the population and the country as a whole.

In conclusion, monarchy is an insane system of government that should be replaced by a more democratic and fair system of government. Monarchy is based on outdated and unjust concepts, and it can be a source of political instability, corruption, economic inequality, cultural suppression, and international conflict. By replacing monarchy with a more democratic and fair system of government, we can create a more just and equitable society, and a more peaceful and prosperous world.",1
668,5038.a2.txt,My thoughts about homosexuals right to adoption,"The issue of adoption by homosexual individuals and couples has been a topic of much debate and controversy in recent years. While some argue that same-sex couples have the same right to adopt as opposite-sex couples, others argue that children are best raised by a mother and father. In this essay, I will argue that homosexuals have the right to adopt and that their sexual orientation should not be a barrier to adoption.

One of the main arguments in favor of adoption by homosexual individuals and couples is that the sexual orientation of the parents should not be a factor in the decision to adopt. Adoption is about finding a loving and stable home for a child, and sexual orientation should not be used as a criteria to determine the suitability of potential parents. Research has shown that children raised by same-sex parents fare just as well as children raised by opposite-sex parents in terms of their development and well-being.

Another argument in favor of adoption by homosexual individuals and couples is that there is a significant need for adoptive parents. Many children in need of adoption come from difficult backgrounds, such as poverty, abuse, or neglect, and they need loving and stable homes. Same-sex couples and individuals are willing and able to provide such homes, and they should not be denied the opportunity to adopt because of their sexual orientation.

Furthermore, denying adoption to same-sex couples and individuals can also have a detrimental effect on the children in need of adoption. Children need loving and stable homes, and denying adoption to same-sex couples and individuals can prolong their stay in foster care, or even lead to them not being adopted at all.

Additionally, many countries have now recognized the rights of same-sex couples to adopt and have laws in place to facilitate it. They have acknowledged that sexual orientation of the parents is irrelevant and that the best interest of the child should be the primary consideration. Denying adoption rights to same-sex couples and individuals can also be a violation of their human rights.

Moreover, society has also evolved in its understanding of sexual orientation and its place in society. It's important for society to continue this evolution and to recognize that love and commitment are the most important factors in a family, regardless of the sexual orientation of the parents.

In conclusion, homosexuals have the right to adopt and their sexual orientation should not be a barrier to adoption. Adoption is about finding a loving and stable home for a child, and sexual orientation should not be used as a criteria to determine the suitability of potential parents. Research has shown that children raised by same-sex parents fare just as well as children raised by opposite-sex parents in terms of their development and well-being. Denying adoption to same-sex couples and individuals can have a detrimental effect on the children in need of adoption, and it can also be a violation of human rights.

669,5039.a2.txt,Echelon - Eavesdroppers Galore,"Echelon is a global surveillance system that is believed to have been developed by the United States and its Five Eyes allies (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom) for the purpose of intercepting and analyzing global communications. This system is said to have the capability to intercept and analyze virtually all forms of electronic communication, including telephone, email, and internet traffic. The existence of Echelon has been the subject of much debate and controversy, with many privacy advocates and civil liberties groups arguing that it is a violation of privacy rights and civil liberties. In this essay, I will explore the issue of Echelon and its potential impact on privacy and civil liberties.

One of the main concerns about Echelon is that it is a violation of privacy rights. The system is said to have the capability to intercept and analyze virtually all forms of electronic communication, including telephone, email, and internet traffic. This means that the government is able to access private information about individuals without their knowledge or consent. This is a violation of privacy rights and can have a detrimental effect on individuals' ability to freely communicate and express themselves.

Another concern about Echelon is that it can be used to target individuals and groups based on their political views or affiliations. The system is said to have the capability to intercept and analyze virtually all forms of electronic communication, including telephone, email, and internet traffic. This means that the government is able to access private information about individuals and groups based on their political views or affiliations, which can lead to targeting and repression of dissident voices.

Furthermore, Echelon can also be used to collect sensitive personal information, such as financial data and medical records, which can be used for a variety of purposes, including identity theft, financial fraud, and blackmail. This can have a detrimental effect on individuals' financial well-being and can lead to the erosion of trust in government and institutions.

Additionally, the existence of Echelon can also have a chilling effect on free speech and expression, as individuals may self-censor their speech and communication for fear of government surveillance and repression. This can have a detrimental effect on democracy and the free exchange of ideas.

Moreover, the existence of Echelon is a cause for concern for businesses, as it can be used to gain access to sensitive business information, such as trade secrets, financial data, and confidential communications. This can have a detrimental effect on businesses' ability to compete in the global market and can lead to the erosion of trust in government and institutions.

In conclusion, Echelon is a global surveillance system that is believed to have been developed by the United States and its Five Eyes allies for the purpose of intercepting and analyzing global communications. The existence of Echelon is a cause for concern, as it can be used to violate privacy rights, target individuals and groups based on their political views or affiliations, collect sensitive personal information, and have a chilling effect on free speech and expression. Furthermore, it can also have a detrimental effect on businesses and can lead to the erosion of trust in government and institutions.

Some argue that children are best raised by a mother and father, while others argue that same-sex couples have the same right to adopt as opposite-sex couples and that children should not be deprived of a loving family because of the sexual orientation of the parents. In this essay, I will argue that having two mums or two dads must be better than growing up in an orphanage or maybe not growing up at all.

One of the main arguments in favor of adoption by same-sex couples is that children need loving and stable homes. Children who are raised in orphanages or other institutional settings are often deprived of the love and care that they need to thrive. They may also be more likely to experience abuse, neglect, and other forms of maltreatment. In contrast, children who are raised by same-sex couples are just as likely to thrive as those raised by opposite-sex couples, and they are not deprived of the love and care that they need to grow into healthy and well-adjusted adults.

Another argument in favor of adoption by same-sex couples is that it can help to reduce the number of children in need of adoption. Many children in need of adoption come from difficult backgrounds, such as poverty, abuse, or neglect, and they need loving and stable homes. Same-sex couples and individuals are willing and able to provide such homes, and they should not be denied the opportunity to adopt because of their sexual orientation.

While some argue that old people's homes provide a safe and comfortable environment for older adults who are no longer able to live independently, others argue that they are a form of institutionalization that can have a detrimental effect on the well-being of older adults. In this essay, I will explore the issue of old people's homes and examine the arguments for and against them.

One of the main arguments in favor of old people's homes is that they provide a safe and comfortable environment for older adults who are no longer able to live independently. Old people's homes are staffed by trained professionals who can provide round-the-clock care and assistance for older adults with medical and physical needs. They also offer a variety of social and recreational activities, which can help to keep older adults active and engaged.

Another argument in favor of old people's homes is that they can provide a sense of community and belonging for older adults who may be lonely or isolated in their own homes. Old people's homes offer the opportunity for older adults to socialize with their peers and to form new friendships. This can have a positive impact on their mental and emotional well-being.

However, there are also arguments against old people's homes. One of the main arguments against them is that they are a form of institutionalization that can have a detrimental effect on the well-being of older adults. Older adults who are placed in old people's homes may feel isolated, lonely, and disconnected from the outside world. They may also feel that they have lost their independence and control over their lives.

Additionally, old people's homes can also be costly, and not everyone can afford to live there. This can lead to older adults being separated from their family, friends and community and can cause them a lot of emotional stress and hardship.

Moreover, old people's homes are often not designed to meet the specific needs of older adults. They may not have the proper equipment or staff to provide the necessary care and support for older adults with complex medical or physical needs. This can lead to inadequate care and can have a detrimental effect on the well-being of older adults.

In conclusion, the issue of old people's homes is a complex one, with arguments for and against them. On one hand, old people's homes can provide a safe and comfortable environment for older adults who are no longer able to live independently. They can also provide a sense of community",1
672,5042.a2.txt,Give your child a good childhood,"Giving a child a good childhood is one of the most important responsibilities of a parent. A good childhood is characterized by love, safety, stability, and opportunities for growth and development. It is a time when children learn how to form relationships, build their self-esteem, and develop their sense of self. In this essay, I will discuss some ways in which parents can give their children a good childhood.

One of the most important ways to give a child a good childhood is to provide a loving and nurturing home environment. This means creating a safe and stable home, where children feel loved and valued. Parents should make sure that their children feel secure and protected, both emotionally and physically. They should also make sure that their children feel that they are a valuable and important part of the family.

Another way to give a child a good childhood is to provide opportunities for growth and development. This means providing children with access to quality education, as well as opportunities to explore their interests and talents. Parents should encourage their children to try new things and to take risks. They should also make sure that their children have access to resources such as books, art supplies, and other materials that can help them learn and grow.

Providing a good role model is also a key way to give a child a good childhood. Children learn from the adults around them and often model their behavior after their parents. Therefore, parents should be mindful of their own behavior and make sure that they are setting a good example for their children. They should also be open and honest with their children, and make sure that they are providing them with accurate information about the world.

In addition, it's essential for parents to spend quality time with their children. This means setting aside regular time to spend with their children, whether it's through meals together, playing games, or going on outings together. Quality time can help children feel loved, valued and connected to their parents and it is a key way to bond and build a strong relationship with them.

Creating a healthy and balanced environment is also crucial for giving a child a good childhood. This means providing children with healthy food, regular exercise and enough sleep. Moreover, children should be taught how to take care of their physical and emotional well-being, and be encouraged to develop healthy habits that will serve them well in the long run.

Finally, it's important to remember that a good childhood is not just about providing children with material goods, but also about providing them with emotional and psychological support. Parents should be available to listen to their children, to provide guidance and to offer words of encouragement. They should also be responsive to their children's needs, whether it's through providing physical comfort",1

In this essay, I will argue that students should be given grants, not loans, to help them afford the cost of higher education.

One of the main arguments in favor of grants over loans is that grants do not have to be repaid. Unlike loans, grants do not create a burden of debt that can have a detrimental effect on students' futures. Instead, grants provide students with the financial assistance they need to afford the cost of higher education without having to worry about repaying the money in the future.

Another argument in favor of grants over loans is that grants can help to reduce the financial burden on students and their families. The cost of higher education has been rising in recent years, and many students and their families are struggling to afford the cost. Grants can help to reduce this burden and make higher education more accessible to students from all backgrounds.

Furthermore, grants can also help to promote greater equality and diversity in higher education. Low-income students and students from underrepresented groups are less likely to be able to afford the cost of higher education without financial assistance. Grants can help to level the playing field and provide these students with the opportunity to pursue higher education.

Additionally, grants can also help to promote greater investment in human capital. Higher education is an investment in the future, and grants can help to ensure that more students have the opportunity to pursue higher education and to develop the skills and knowledge they need to be successful in the future.

Moreover, giving grants instead of loans can help to prevent students from being trapped in a cycle of debt, which can have a detrimental effect on their future financial stability. A grant can provide the necessary funds for students to complete their education and not have to worry about repaying the money in the future.

In conclusion, students should be given grants, not loans, to help them afford the cost of higher education. Grants do not have to be repaid, and they can help to reduce the financial burden on students and their families. They can also help to promote greater equality and diversity in higher education, and can help to promote greater investment in human capital. Furthermore, they can help to prevent students from being trapped in a cycle of debt, which can have a detrimental effect on their future financial stability.

While some argue that smoking ban in public places is necessary to protect public health, others argue that it is a violation of personal freedom and can harm the business of such places. In this essay, I will examine the arguments for and against smoking ban in restaurants, cafes, and bars and argue that a smoking ban in these places is necessary to protect public health.

One of the main arguments in favor of smoking ban in restaurants, cafes, and bars is that it can help to protect the health of employees and customers. Secondhand smoke is a known health hazard and can cause serious health problems such as lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory illness. By banning smoking in these places, employees and customers are protected from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke.

Another argument in favor of smoking ban in restaurants, cafes, and bars is that it can help to reduce the number of smoking-related deaths and illnesses. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death worldwide, and smoking is responsible for nearly 6 million deaths annually. By banning smoking in these places, it can help to reduce the number of smoking-related deaths and illnesses.

Furthermore, smoking ban in restaurants, cafes, and bars can also help to create a more pleasant and comfortable environment for non-smokers. Many non-smokers find the smell and smoke of cigarettes unpleasant and it can be uncomfortable for them to dine or socialize in places where smoking is allowed. By banning smoking in these places, non-smokers can enjoy their meals and socialize in a smoke-free environment.

Additionally, smoking ban in restaurants, cafes, and bars can also help to reduce the cost of healthcare associated with smoking-related illnesses. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), smoking-related illnesses cost the United States over $300 billion annually, including both direct medical costs and lost productivity. By banning smoking in these places, it can help to reduce these costs and save money for the healthcare system.

Moreover, smoking ban in restaurants, cafes, and bars can also help to reduce the number of young people who start smoking. According to the CDC, nearly 90% of adult smokers start smoking before the age of 18, and exposure to smoking in public places can increase the likelihood of young people starting to smoke. By banning smoking in these places, it can help to reduce the number of young people who start smoking.

Some argue that smoking ban in restaurants, cafes, and bars can harm the business of such places, particularly bars and nightclubs. However, studies have shown that smoking ban in these places does not harm business, and in some cases, it can even increase business as non-smoking customers are more likely to frequent these places.",1

676,5046.a2.txt,Why hunting is necessary,"Hunting has been a part of human history for thousands of years, and it is still a popular and controversial activity today. While some argue that hunting is a necessary practice for population control and conservation, others argue that it is cruel, unnecessary, and should be banned. In this essay, I will examine the reasons why hunting is necessary and the benefits that it can bring.

One of the main reasons why hunting is necessary is that it can help to control animal populations. In many areas, animal populations can become overpopulated, which can lead to a variety of problems such as overgrazing, disease, and competition for resources. Hunting can help to control these populations and prevent these problems from occurring.

Another reason why hunting is necessary is that it can help to conserve wildlife. Hunting can help to maintain the balance of ecosystems by removing animals that are old, sick, or injured. This can help to ensure that the remaining animals are healthy and have the resources they need to survive. Additionally, hunting can also help to conserve endangered species by providing funding for conservation efforts through hunting licenses and taxes on hunting equipment.

Furthermore, hunting can also help to provide food for people. In many rural areas, hunting is a necessary source of protein and can help to supplement the diets of local communities. Hunting can also help to provide jobs and income for local people, particularly in areas where there are few other economic opportunities.

Additionally, hunting can also help to promote a deeper understanding and appreciation of wildlife. By participating in hunting, people can learn about the biology, behavior, and habitat of the animals they are hunting. This can help to promote a greater understanding and appreciation of wildlife, which can help to conserve these animals in the long term.

Moreover, hunting is a traditional activity that has been passed down from generation to generation. It can help to keep alive cultural traditions and help to maintain social cohesion within communities. It's an activity that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, and it can be a great way to bond with family and friends.

However, it's important to note that hunting should be done in a responsible and sustainable manner. Hunting regulations should be put in place to ensure that hunting is done in a way that is safe and ethical, and that the population of the hunted species is not endangered. Moreover, hunting should be done in a way that is respectful to the animal, and the hunter should be trained and knowledgeable about the animals they are hunting.

In conclusion, hunting is a necessary practice that can bring many benefits, including population control, conservation, food provision, cultural preservation, and greater understanding and appreciation of wildlife. However, it's important that hunting is done in a responsible and sustainable manner, and that",1
677,5047.a2.txt,Park your car,"parking a car can seem like a simple task, but it can also be a source of frustration and stress for many people. Whether it's finding a parking spot in a crowded city or remembering where you parked your car in a large parking lot, parking can be a challenge. In this essay, I will examine some of the challenges of parking and discuss ways to make the process easier and less stressful.

One of the main challenges of parking is finding a spot in crowded areas, particularly in urban areas. Cities are becoming increasingly dense, and as a result, finding a parking spot can be difficult and time-consuming. This can lead to frustration and stress for drivers, and it can also contribute to traffic congestion and air pollution. To address this challenge, cities can implement strategies such as creating designated parking areas, implementing parking meters, and encouraging the use of public transportation.

Another challenge of parking is remembering where you parked your car. This can be particularly challenging in large parking lots or garages, where it can be easy to lose track of your car among the many rows of parked vehicles. To address this challenge, drivers can use apps or other tools to help them remember where they parked their car, such as a map or a note.

A third challenge of parking is the cost. In some cities and towns, the cost of parking can be quite high, and it can be difficult for drivers to afford. This can be particularly challenging for low-income drivers or those who rely on their car for transportation. To address this challenge, cities can implement strategies such as creating designated parking areas or implementing parking meters.

A fourth challenge of parking is the safety. In some areas, parking can be quite dangerous, particularly in areas with high crime rates or poor lighting. To address this challenge, cities can implement strategies such as creating designated parking areas or implementing parking meters.

A fifth challenge of parking is the accessibility. In some areas, parking can be quite difficult for people with disabilities, particularly in areas with poor accessibility or inadequate parking facilities. To address this challenge, cities can implement strategies such as creating designated parking areas or implementing parking meters.

In conclusion, parking can be a challenging task for many drivers, but there are ways to make the process easier and less stressful. By implementing strategies such as creating designated parking areas, implementing parking meters, and encouraging the use of public transportation, cities can help to address the challenges of parking and make it easier for drivers to find and park their cars. Additionally, using apps, maps or notes can help drivers to remember where they parked their car, and making parking accessible and safer can help to create a better parking experience for everyone.",1
678,5048.a2.txt,Stop smoking!,"Smoking is a dangerous and deadly habit that affects millions of people worldwide. It is the leading cause of preventable death and illness, causing lung cancer, heart disease, stroke, and a host of other health problems. Despite the well-known dangers of smoking, many people continue to smoke, often because they find it difficult to quit. In this essay, we will discuss the reasons why people smoke and the steps that can be taken to help them quit.

One of the main reasons people smoke is addiction to nicotine, the addictive substance found in cigarettes. Nicotine is a highly addictive drug that activates the pleasure centers of the brain and creates a feeling of euphoria. When smokers quit, they experience withdrawal symptoms such as irritability, anxiety, and difficulty sleeping. These symptoms can make it difficult for smokers to quit, even when they know the risks.

Another reason people smoke is social pressure. Many smokers start smoking as a way to fit in with their peers or to appear more grown-up. In addition, smoking is often portrayed in the media as glamorous and sophisticated, which can make it appealing to young people.

Smoking also has a psychological component. Many smokers use cigarettes as a way to cope with stress or to relax. The act of smoking and the nicotine hit can serve as a form of self-medication for those who suffer from anxiety or depression.

To quit smoking, the first step is to understand the reasons why you smoke. Once you understand the reasons, you can develop a plan to overcome them. Nicotine replacement therapy, such as gum or patches, can help reduce withdrawal symptoms and ease the transition to a smoke-free life.

Another important step is to find alternative ways to cope with stress and anxiety. Exercise, yoga, and meditation are all effective ways to manage stress and promote relaxation. Joining a support group or talking to a counselor can""",1
679,5049.a2.txt,Why take the boat when you can fly?,"In today's fast-paced world, the convenience and speed of air travel has made it a popular choice for many people. However, some still prefer to take the boat instead of flying, whether it's for a vacation or for business. In this essay, I will examine the reasons why some people choose to take the boat instead of flying, and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of both options.

One of the main reasons why some people choose to take the boat instead of flying is the experience. Boats offer a unique and immersive experience that flying cannot match. For many people, the experience of being on the water, feeling the wind in their hair, and seeing the sea and the horizon is a major draw. Boats also offer a more relaxed and leisurely pace of travel, which can be a welcome change from the hustle and bustle of air travel.

Another reason why some people choose to take the boat instead of flying is the cost. Boats are often less expensive than planes, particularly for longer journeys. This can make them a more affordable option for many people, particularly those on a budget. Additionally, some boats offer all-inclusive packages, which can include meals, accommodation, and activities, which can also make it more cost-effective.

A third reason why some people choose to take the boat instead of flying is the environmental impact. Boats are often considered a more environmentally friendly option than planes, as they produce fewer emissions and have a smaller carbon footprint. This is particularly true for boats powered by renewable energy sources such as wind or solar power.

However, taking the boat also has its drawbacks, one of the main drawback is the time, boats can take significantly longer to reach a destination than planes. This can be a major issue for people who are short on time, or who need to get to a destination quickly for business or other reasons. Additionally, boats can be subject to weather-related delays, which can also add to travel time.

Another drawback of taking the boat is the limited destinations. Boats can only travel to destinations that are reachable by water, which limits the number of places that can be visited. This can be a major issue for people who want to travel to more remote or less-visited destinations.

Additionally, taking the boat can also be less comfortable than flying. Boats can be cramped and noisy, and they can also be subject to motion sickness. This can be a major issue for people who are sensitive to motion or who have health problems.

In conclusion, taking the boat can be a unique and enjoyable experience, but it also has its drawbacks. Boats offer a more relaxed and leisurely pace of travel, and they can be less expensive and more environmentally friendly than planes. However, they can also take longer to reach a destination, be subject to weather-related delays, and have limited destinations. Additionally, they can be less comfortable than planes. Ultimately, whether to take the boat or fly depends on the individual's priorities, budget, and destination.",1
