For human essays, we leveraged the UC Davis Corpus of Written Spanish, L2 and Heritage Speakers (COWSL2HS) (https://github.com/ucdaviscl/cowsl2h). 

The corpus originally contains short essays collected from students enrolled in university-level Spanish courses. 

We consider only essays written by L2 learners. Essay topics are varied. 

For this study, we use 70 essays from five different topics, totaling 350 essays for analysis.

We complement the dataset with the same number of machine-generated texts. 

For this purpose, we prompt ChatGPT with the following caption: "Escribe un ensayo de 800 palabras sobre [tema]." 

Topics are matched for each human writing in our dataset.
